On June 2014, Freexian invoiced the first LTS sponsors. 5 years later, a small retrospective is in order. From there we will question ourselves on why LTS was so successful and whether the Debian community can leverage money to pay contributors at a larger scale.

	00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:11,889
funding free software development is

00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:16,759
very important and as the developer I

00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:20,840
would dream to do this during 100% of my

00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:25,880
time so first time I heard about Raphael

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:29,559
hog he was crowdfunding his Debian

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,340
handbook the translation in English so

00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:38,330
he's continuing this kind of work with a

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,510
longtime support Debian funding and

00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,280
release so he will talk about that thank

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,829
you - thank you

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,930
[Applause]

00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:53,060
hello everybody so I'm here today

00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,210
because while I've been involved in the

00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,720
Debian long-term support project since

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:05,630
the start it's been I think five years

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:09,469
we started in June 2014 with long-term

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,899
support of Debian 6 squeeze so we'll go

00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:16,210
through five years of history quickly

00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:16,210
and discuss how it went

00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:22,939
so I guess most of you know it already

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,759
the Debian LTS project is about

00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:28,369
extending the secretary support of Devon

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,979
stable release from three years to five

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,499
years three years is roughly what they'd

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:37,959
be a security team the main security

00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:41,090
team provides and we extending it for

00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:44,719
two years more which allows basically to

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:50,630
skip a release if you're running servers

00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:54,259
for five years always how did this

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,810
project start will it start by a few

00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:59,090
Debian developers we're doing internal

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,729
long term support for a few key packages

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,279
that they thought were important in the

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,639
companies in the US kale and they

00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:11,420
decided to team up together to share the

00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:15,560
work and to well make it available to

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,270
everybody so at that time we made a

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,310
public call

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,260
for others to join because we were

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,000
expecting that other companies were

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:30,380
doing the same and they could let their

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,270
employee work on the project but at the

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,400
same time we wanted to offer the

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:41,120
possibility to contribute with money and

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,440
not only with employee time so well one

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,390
option was to have many divyam

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,240
developers come and say hey I'm here you

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:52,910
can hire me to work on this but it's not

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:55,960
very practical so I use the fact that I

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,850
had at my own company to create a

00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,090
Norfolk where many Debian developers

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:07,840
joined behind me to collect the money

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,840
from sponsors and paid even developers

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,410
so that's a bit on the wiki page there

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,560
everybody who accepts money to be paid

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:22,100
on LTS but mainly you will feel we only

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,720
find people who are working as part of

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:29,209
the team that we created on the friction

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:33,140
so friction is really an intermediary in

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:37,160
this here's you have a big list of

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:39,920
sponsors and the friction is making

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,440
invoice to them and we collect the money

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,170
and we dispatch which one throw this

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,380
into work hours and we dispatch those

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,590
work hours to Debian contributors every

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,880
month at the end of the month each

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,150
contributor is expected to provide a

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,510
report we check the report and publish

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,020
this on our website to make it's

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,020
transparent

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,640
so over five years there have been a few

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,430
changes one of them is that we added

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,389
more architectures at the start it was

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:22,440
only limited to e3 86 and IND 64 and we

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:27,930
added Armel and armed hf for a stretch

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,880
we will likely add also armed 64 AD the

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,400
stat with the limited funding we

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,200
supported only a subset of the packages

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,740
the most popular that were used by our

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,050
sponsors but with time we managed to

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,790
have enough funding to support almost

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:49,500
all packages some of those packages are

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:53,729
quite hard to support so for example

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,010
again we work with Credit Eve was killed

00:04:53,729 --> 00:05:01,080
people knowing then to maintain the bag

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:04,680
for that we need so those are not Debian

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,479
developed it's a it's also depend

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,840
developers mainly which are working at

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,600
credit it but while they are not part of

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,660
the usual Debian contributors that I

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:21,930
manage it's really an invoice to another

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:24,060
company as I said at the start the idea

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,539
was to pull up research and human

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:32,160
resource from many companies but in fact

00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:34,100
is quickly dried because while the

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,889
people the Debian contributors that

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,690
friction what we're paying what paying

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:43,500
tend to be more reactive than employees

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,860
who did that part-time and well they

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,910
just had nothing left to do when they

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,690
for the package that they were

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,690
interested in

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:59,050
so mainly nowadays almost all the

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,200
important contributors to divinities are

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,570
paid through the frictional sponsorship

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,060
also at the start we used to asked

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,330
politely package maintainer to try to

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,030
provide updates for us if they had some

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,490
time we no longer asked it explicitly

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,290
they can still do it but we know no

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:24,740
longer ask for it because we have enough

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:27,320
free throws to under most updates there

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,530
are a few exceptions PostgreSQL is one

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,230
of them because the main debian package

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,350
is maintained by a Debian developer

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,790
which is with a credit of employee so

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:49,130
they also maintain the PostgreSQL in

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:53,510
alts which adds that every time that our

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:58,430
LTS ends which there are a few company

00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:03,200
who comes up and say why does it stop so

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,120
early I need more usually they come two

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,880
weeks before and it's too late to

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,140
organize anything but they made a

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,660
mistake once and for the second LTS they

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,630
came earlier and I also mentioned the

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:23,479
possibility earlier in a big way so we

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:25,010
created an extended LTS for wizzy so it

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:31,760
works a bit differently because there

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:34,760
are far fewer sponsors and so we want to

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,410
support all their packages but only for

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,370
a limited set of architecture because

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:42,410
usually not using arm device but they

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,310
don't pay what they want they you have

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:48,350
to pay what we asked them to - because

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,440
we want to have enough time to support

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:54,860
all their packages and we split that

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,810
among all the sponsors but some point

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,610
sponsor will want maybe six month more

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,590
just the time to meet great a few

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,610
servers and other will want to keep it

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:06,020
alive for more so the cost is

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:10,310
reevaluated each

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:12,229
so when a sponsor stops to participate

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:17,740
the other sponsors have to pay more for

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:21,349
their package set so that's how it work

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,699
so we see was the first one first

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:25,729
distribution where we offered the

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:29,889
extended address and it will likely last

00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:34,270
until the end of this year so it will

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:37,279
provided one half here more of support

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,990
there this you were right away you can

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,020
find the repositories the list of

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:47,600
package supported and any information

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:51,350
related to to this project now some

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,350
interesting data some figures so five

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,940
years already what I said over the years

00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:01,459
we paid 24 contributors and there are 14

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:09,740
of them who are active right now and I

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:12,950
repaid each month we found 250 hours per

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,860
month here you see how it evolved

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:18,950
between the starch 5 years before and

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,570
right now the number of contributors

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:26,750
grow together with the number of hours

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:30,740
fondant it's a deliberate choice I did

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,870
not want to have anyone well I wanted to

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,170
have a resilient team so if anyone stops

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,360
it I'm not in a big trouble but I also

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,029
did not want anyone to be dependent on

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,550
the income that friction provided they

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:50,089
had to have something else besides LTS 2

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:54,110
to 4 the life for so it's always a

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:57,520
part-time activity when your LTS

00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:03,529
contributors you get between 15 and 30

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:07,329
hours per month of work some figures

00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:11,930
about sponsors we are close to 60

00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:14,779
sponsors you can see how they are split

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:18,440
among patent importance of God sorry

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,960
silver bronze etc obviously there are

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,670
more

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,220
bronze and silver but if you look

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:31,140
closely at Zama amount of hours that are

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:34,650
sponsored it's more well spread so yeah

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:37,950
I prefer having lots of small sponsors

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,920
because it has fewer impact when one

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,290
stops but if we lose one platinum

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,520
sponsors it's immediately three days of

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:50,730
work per month which are going away so I

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:55,670
pray for many small sponsors and few big

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,670
but it's quite well spread right now

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,660
it's a lot of money that is going on

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,210
through friction to pet the gun

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,910
contributed the reports only speak about

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,100
work hours but the rate is fixed so you

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,760
can do the calculation yourself and I

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,860
made the calculation for you just to

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,130
give some impressive figures so we are

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,350
close to 600 thousand euros paid to

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,110
various Davina LT has contributed over

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,220
the five years so it's a lot for

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:33,570
individuals like us it's not so much for

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:36,210
big companies but and the tingly need

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:42,120
individual who worked during the whole

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:50,150
five years got about eighty thousand

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:52,680
euros well more instance interestingly

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,170
the former debian project leader was

00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,360
part of the pet LTS contributor and

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:03,540
during is two years of leadership he got

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,690
sponsored by well LT sponsored on

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:11,250
friction and surprisingly nobody

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:14,760
complains that I bought responses both

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:18,810
undue influence on the leadership so

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,460
that's a good thing maybe some people

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:27,570
thought about it anyway but nobody

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:29,700
complained well at start or we did set

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:35,520
up a rules to try to avoid problems

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:39,290
because we knew that the topic was can

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:43,190
lead to problems so there are rules to

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,710
decide who can join our the splits among

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:49,770
contributors what must be done what can

00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:52,500
be done on paid time and who decides in

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:57,330
case of problems all the expectations

00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:00,570
are clear at least I hope so so

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,940
basically anyone with the Debian

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,800
contributor

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:09,860
developer maintainer who has prior

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,420
experience with secretive dates can join

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,160
while obviously needs some programming

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,790
skills because you have to write patches

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,360
in many different packages you have to

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:24,390
have some fiscal

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,890
well I'm friction with the company I can

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,920
only pay invoice so you have to have a

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,740
way to remit invoice obviously and you

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,270
must accept some basic rules like

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,210
privacy of sponsor data you have to

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:42,900
accept to public to publish your monthly

00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:45,300
reports so well you must be aware that

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:51,240
also no I mean you how much money you

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:54,170
got from me and so friction you have to

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,760
a bit to the Debian code of conduct and

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,280
you have to make your best effort to

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,740
meet the quality standards of Debian in

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:08,520
general of the day and security team in

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:11,670
particular now how do we split hours

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,850
among contributors it's simple we split

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,980
sim evenly but obviously not all

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,440
contributors have the same amount of

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,330
time so you can fix a limit you can say

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,850
I don't want more than 10 hours or 12

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:27,300
hours and most contributors do set a

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,270
limit so wrongly three or four which

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,900
accept a name infinite amount of work

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:36,030
every month we also don't want to give

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,000
too few hours because you can't really

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:41,300
prepare security update in two hours

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,440
you need at least four to five hours to

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:51,250
do a youth job so we have a minimum

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,660
amount that we can undoubtly

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,550
for the amount of hours that we have we

00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:00,890
would organize a rotation but this never

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:04,370
happened so far as time grew as rocket

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:11,150
I'm available GRU I always recruited new

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:13,700
persons and it was well so far so what

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:16,550
must be done this is just basic work so

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,770
there's a TV III aging so handling

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:22,130
incoming issue looking whether there are

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,740
applicable or not obviously propose a

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,230
creative date and publish them there's

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,120
an obligation to respond to queries to

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,310
of all the Debian contributors there's

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,280
nothing more annoying that when you come

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:37,010
to ask a question and you don't get any

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,140
answer and uh this not acceptable from

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:44,839
from someone who is paid so there's this

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:46,820
obligation but we have also ruled that

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,280
what is acceptable to be done on paid

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:55,010
time even if it's not exactly the core

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:57,260
of what we have to do for instance well

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,920
you can write the patch if a dream

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,350
hasn't provided anyone any patch yet you

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,140
can also prepare a security update for

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,680
others release because when you have

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,530
made refer to do it for one release it's

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,020
often helpful to prepare it for unstable

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:17,450
if the maintainer is really busy or if

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:22,160
the security team kindly asked some help

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:25,310
well we we do provide it we can also

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,910
work on the infrastructure which means

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,940
may need a security tracker but also on

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,010
various packages themselves either to

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,690
enable things which are useful from the

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,110
security perspective like there are

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,270
dining plugs or adding Auto packaged

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,310
test because well when you do a security

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,010
update you want to test the package that

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,810
you don't break it for us we don't know

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,150
all the software in Debian so when there

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:54,290
are auto package tests we do run them

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:58,460
and so we try to help to add them as

00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:03,110
well this kind of thing that we allowed

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:06,500
to do when we have workers and no there

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:12,170
are no urgency or no current packaged to

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,520
the to fix and the last rule is we

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,709
decide in case of problem

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,829
well friction beings trusted

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:22,929
intermediary it freaks you out decided

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:26,959
and friction is basically me and my wife

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:30,620
so if there are issue there is someone

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,100
who can decide most they day-to-day work

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,800
is no managed by all-girl Epson we will

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,540
dispatch work hours and collect reports

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:44,540
and stuff like that but most decisions

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,240
are taken by consensus among all the

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:52,100
paid contributors but in case of issue

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:57,020
there's a large tree throats so lessons

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:59,120
learned it's possible to pay Debian

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,179
contributors without disrupting the

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,270
entire community I say this because well

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:07,970
for a long time the the topic of money

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:15,130
in Debian has been a taboo because we

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:17,420
had a big incident in 2005 I think we're

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:22,220
Debian leader try to pay the release

00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:24,650
manager to get a release quicker out it

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,390
was a good I had to quit early it seemed

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,460
like a good idea in principle because

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,230
well Ronnie's management estate use work

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,130
and it takes a lot of time at release

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:39,280
time in a specific point but obviously

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:41,360
the money was from Debian well Mona was

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,840
targeted to release manager by the

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,500
Debian leader and nobody else had any

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,840
say and nobody else was a few people

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,030
were being paid at that time Indian so

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:58,250
it didn't go well and in fact many

00:18:53,030 --> 00:19:00,290
people or a few people tried to find new

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,300
airship release critical bugs to

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,240
actually delay the release that they

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,450
wanted to

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,860
be faster by paying people so in the end

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:12,120
it didn't work very well

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:15,390
and ever since well it's kind of taboo

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,980
topic in Debian but it's coming again

00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:22,679
because in the last leadership

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,840
discussion prior to the election well at

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,659
least one leader suggested the idea to

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,909
use money to pay people to do work and

00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:32,429
well we had some interesting discussion

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:36,690
but no big flame war and no disruption

00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:39,840
and well in 10 years the situation

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:42,110
change many of us know working in open

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,730
source and free software as part of our

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:50,840
professional life it's not only hobby

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:55,529
and well so we can go forward possibly

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,470
still we must be careful and I think

00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:01,250
those rules that I tried to follow for

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,270
the Debian 80s are a good starting point

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,460
everything you do must be done

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:08,100
transparently in an inclusive way

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,649
meaning everybody gets a fair chance to

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:15,029
participate well there must be rules

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:16,710
always but there must be they must be

00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,919
clearly documented and so that so

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:23,130
expectation are clear obviously do not

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:27,960
want to get anyone locked in a position

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:30,539
while being paid because if we can

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,940
continue to be Betty will prefer this

00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:35,580
and so it will make choices that may

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:40,409
prevent Ã¶zil from taking over that is

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:45,870
bad so you have to have rules to avoid

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:47,929
this well obviously we must be aware

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,640
that it will change things

00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:54,140
possibly for the good but possibly also

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:59,120
in bad ways and when it comes into play

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,120
pre our priorities of people will change

00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:07,620
so and this is where I will hand out a

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:13,440
few ideas what could we use money for in

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:16,169
Debian actually there are many ideas one

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,100
is package maintenance trane is strange

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,429
because it's at the core

00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,559
what we do and it doesn't seem natural

00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:26,210
to suggest this but actually when you

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,130
think of it there are many packages that

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:32,970
users want but nobody in Debian cares

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:35,070
about they are possibly orphaned or

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,320
maybe there are soft wells that are not

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,299
yet in demand that users really want but

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,190
nobody in Debian cares about and

00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,289
actually it's part of my business

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,809
friction other webpage where I offered

00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:48,630
to package something into Debian for

00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:53,250
someone and I do have at least five or

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:56,010
six customers like this on the opposite

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,740
side I'm paying Debian maintainer to

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:01,110
maintain treaten it's a software that I

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,970
use for accounting is free software that

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,490
was one of the early choice that I've

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,130
made to do all my accounting with free

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:12,030
software unfortunately it's not really

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,750
popular software so at some point so the

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,850
guy said Oh

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,480
enough is enough it's too much work for

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:24,900
me I don't want to maintain it anymore I

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:27,270
said I'm using it I need it so I paid

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,370
for the dates and I will continue to pay

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:33,860
but it's a bit a lot of money for just

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:36,900
me as a company but again this idea of

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:41,520
sharing the cost that many with many

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:44,549
authors is a good idea we can obviously

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,659
fund new infrastructure in Debian we

00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:52,320
have this project of having package are

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:54,059
shy archive for each package so that we

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,860
can provide multiple versions in

00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:01,320
parallel but nobody gets to implement it

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:05,520
I maintained tracker Debian dot org

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,320
there are thousands of good idea as wish

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,150
list bugs that I would like to see

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,679
implemented and I would not mind if

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:15,929
people were being paid to implement them

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,570
there's a limit because obviously I

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:20,610
still want to review and review

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:24,419
reviewing takes time so if we go in this

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:27,990
direction who might be issue to consider

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:30,210
that you might also want to compensate

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:33,920
the rock of the reviewer and not only

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,920
of the person who is doing the work

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,050
there are also plenty of repetitive and

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,240
sang clicks tasks like the new review or

00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,470
the review of twin block requests during

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,570
freeze

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:54,050
why not possibly using money to get

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:56,520
those things done there are often

00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,500
blocking point in the sense that all the

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,830
Debian developers are waiting for them

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,920
before being able to continue so it's a

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:08,370
good idea to bring money to streamline

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:12,360
those kind of process more recently I

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:15,090
also read an article of melida blog was

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,450
suggesting to pay a leadership role

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:21,600
because well being Debian project leader

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:26,040
is a hot part-time job really so only

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:30,690
people who have enough income can afford

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,820
to run because if you have to work five

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,950
days a day five days a week to have

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:41,310
enough money to live you won't spend two

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:44,390
days for Debian so it's that would be a

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:51,120
way to have more candidates and be less

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:54,270
restrictive well that's it I'm opening a

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,880
kind of forums or a debate on where we

00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:04,830
could use the money in Debian now it's

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:09,480
up to you now that redhead got bought by

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:14,910
IBM and we have LTS established and

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:18,960
proven might what do you see maybe some

00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:21,330
more requests for Debian as a long-term

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,990
supported linux distribution and related

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:27,840
to this a big company like Google when

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:31,050
they wants to cooperate when they need a

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,760
provider of a Debian this Debian based

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,910
list was they go to canonical because

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:39,510
somehow canonical crossed a threshold to

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:42,480
be visible to Google and smaller

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,160
companies like narrative they are not on

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,400
the screen why

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,630
do you think is adaptive not on the

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,800
screen but canonical as well why I don't

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:57,720
know but it's a matter of fact yes that

00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:02,100
for very big cooperation you you have

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,550
those rules so if you have a company and

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:08,120
a clear support contract you can work

00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:11,310
with them and otherwise you can't I

00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:17,220
don't have any clear solution to this

00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:19,500
but it's a problem it's a wrong problem

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,970
technical ways because there are plenty

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,740
of companies we have the skill is

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,660
required to maintain Debian and to

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:28,350
provide support to Devon but we have no

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,970
clear standardized offer maybe it's

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,590
something that Debian project should

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,740
think about it

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,630
I mean certifying some partners as being

00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,830
competent enough but I don't know how it

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:42,900
would work it's not so really

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,610
interesting as free software

00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,620
contribution so it's not the kind of

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,950
thing that gets organized but that would

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:56,900
be useful still so maybe a way to use

00:26:49,950 --> 00:27:02,640
money to organize is on another subject

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:05,540
how do you reconcile the fact that LCS

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,850
is paid work that depends on

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:11,220
infrastructure that is run by volunteers

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,950
for instance you put packages to the

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,020
Debian archive the Debian archive is

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,660
maintained by a set of volunteers that's

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:26,870
very overworked how do you reconcile

00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:26,870
those two things I don't I mean

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:33,570
obviously the question comes up when we

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:36,660
want to change the rules I mean when we

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:40,020
wanted to other new architectures we

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:43,350
have to ask buildi admins and ESA

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:46,890
whether they are ok to keep the server's

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:51,570
up for two more years and we have to

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:54,350
accept those and when we get I know well

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:57,720
we do it outside like I did it with

00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:01,620
extended their tests

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,030
but well basically TSE is a sort of

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,820
middle ground that is well accepted I

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,680
mean everybody is aware that while

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,990
companies do need five years of support

00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:16,660
and that it was an important requirement

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:21,700
so that's it that said I'm not opposed

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:24,580
to share incomes I mean if if I if we

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,530
had to give some money back to help with

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,800
support of the infrastructure we would

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,750
be able to do it and in fact with

00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:37,360
extended LTS project we do have some

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:54,040
spare money that we will use to spot

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:58,750
will sponsor DEP conf this year yes so

00:28:54,040 --> 00:29:04,510
they have Enterprise who supports VLC

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:07,750
and this didn't make them evil so they

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:10,210
they succeeds to do good work to

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:15,010
maintain VLC to develop a lot of stuff

00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:19,170
around VLC and also they they also

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:22,570
declined offers of publicity of

00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:25,210
companies who wanted to inject publicity

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:27,430
on VLC so they really are not evil

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,760
people even if they get paid for what

00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:33,730
they do so is there do you know other

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,640
projects that are in Debian that think

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:41,860
about this about sponsoring our work

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,840
development work and is there I don't

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:47,020
know a project of discussing things

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:53,130
about how to get paid for everything and

00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:57,370
in that case you would also pay the

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:59,590
everyone everyone that you rely on so I

00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:02,980
had their projects to talk about it and

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:06,340
to maybe not consider it as a taboo

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:12,350
anymore yes there are so

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:14,990
obviously there are projects like the

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,150
Linux Foundation founding core

00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,060
infrastructure and injecting money to

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:22,940
open SSL ins as that kind of project but

00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:26,120
I have seen recently a company called

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:30,800
tight tight lift which is trying to

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:32,780
generalize well the way to inject money

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,690
into all software and not only on the

00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:40,040
base packages that we all rely on

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,800
actually I know you to contact them and

00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:47,540
to start a discussion but I never went

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:49,550
that far but it's all time of the home I

00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:54,440
think he with been a bear in this

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:56,540
project we close to over but I don't

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,270
mind taking more questions either arrow

00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:04,630
after like you want spell the name of

00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,630
the company you mentioned I'd lift T I

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,400
discussion going on about this kind of

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,560
stuff so you talked about the incident

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,990
so after this has it been some other

00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,830
discussions about being paid for

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:31,430
developing things in Debian from time to

00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:34,210
time but not really what I as I said it

00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:37,040
for the taboo so not much discussion

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,730
this year in the deeper the election we

00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,890
discussed it a bit it was a important

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:47,150
part of the project of Martin mission

00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:49,250
mayor who's they've an old-timer like me

00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,730
except that he bit of stopped

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:57,020
contributing because while he's doing

00:31:52,730 --> 00:32:01,400
open sources work but not a side project

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:05,020
anymore he wanted to reconcile the

00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,020
Vienna needs work life in some way

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,410
yeah we are out of time maybe you can

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:15,020
ask questions in the in the hallway yes

00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:18,050
sure you can go and grab me a mirror

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,970
until tomorrow I guess we can we can

00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:23,950
thank all our I found an Alice Cooper

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:29,170
from this morning thank you very much

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:29,170
