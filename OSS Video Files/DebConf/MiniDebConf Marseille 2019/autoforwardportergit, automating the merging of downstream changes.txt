I co-founded the Raspbian project, to provide an armv6 hard-float variant of Debian, to do this local changes were needed in a number of packages and manually bringing these forward to the new versions from Debian rapidly became a drag.
Therefore I developed the autoforwardporter tool to automate this process, initially it was based around debdiff and patch, but after some discussions with Ian Jackson I decided it was a good idea to rebuild it around dgit. I later took steps to generalise the tool so it would be useable by projects other than Raspbian.
