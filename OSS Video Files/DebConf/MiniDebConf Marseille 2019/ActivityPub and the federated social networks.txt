I've been on the federated social networks since 2013 and tried to promote them and self/community hosting in my local community.
The state of the federated social networks after the adoption of the ActivityPub standard, why it is important for computing freedom and what is being done and can be done inside Debian to help.

	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:12,860
so we are welcoming Alayna of Valhalla

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:17,300
who will talk about the activity pub so

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:22,850
activity pub spiritual master Don the

00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:27,730
future she will tell us more thank you

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:31,759
[Applause]

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:34,250
so I think that when number of people

00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:40,430
here probably Carib a bit about free

00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:46,059
software and that some at least some of

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:49,309
you can also of the marginal problems of

00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:51,710
freedom in computing not just the

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:54,410
software on someone's computer but also

00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:02,719
when interacting with other platforms

00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:06,409
and where our data goes when we do

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:11,680
something online etc and there are lots

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:15,110
of problem that are around this area

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,480
only few of which can be fully solved by

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:22,790
only running free software on our own

00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:29,150
computers because nowadays we are

00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:34,820
spending lots of time in dealing with

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:37,760
other people's computers and giving them

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,810
the control of what is happening even if

00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:46,310
on our side everything is is a software

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:50,750
there is one specific emitter problem in

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:54,110
desire which is social networks so

00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,530
humans are social beings so they they

00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:01,930
like to have platforms that allow them

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:04,550
to talk to each other share things

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:08,060
whatever they they want to share with

00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:10,310
other people but most of the social

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,940
networks and nowadays are in the hands

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,190
of a few companies that have shown many

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,650
times that they can't be trusted with

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,879
our

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,760
data their main aim is to collect as

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:29,010
much data as possible in order to sell

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,620
it to advertisers and ok they give us a

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:40,189
service in exchange so it's not a

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:43,549
complete one-sided relationship but

00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:46,590
they've shown that you are not able to

00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:52,319
give this the data the data we are

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:54,989
giving them the right care so one thing

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,799
that I recommend reading about this is

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:06,420
the Empire of oily rags by Cory Doctorow

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:10,769
who explains how big data from social

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,769
network companies unlike a company that

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:17,220
is collecting oily rags squeezing out

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:21,109
the oil and selling it but of course

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,699
this is a an expensive expensive project

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:26,489
project where they don't give get as

00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:29,459
much money from each bit of oil they

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:34,250
manage to squeeze out so it only works

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:37,829
if they can just put all of their drugs

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,260
somewhere and if it takes fire it's

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,319
somebody else's problem which is what

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:49,199
the social network companies are

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:51,269
basically doing with our data there is a

00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,699
solution well there is one solution

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,120
which is avoiding social networks and

00:03:53,699 --> 00:04:03,000
it's not really a solution that a lot of

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:06,449
people can actually use there are some

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,970
people who have a family pressure to be

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:13,379
able to share pictures of their children

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,930
with their grandfather and there are

00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:20,549
also people who need their social

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:23,779
interaction to to be happy so saying ok

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:28,409
just avoid it it's not a good solution

00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,820
but there is another solution which is

00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:34,320
taking back

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:37,260
social networks and bring it bring it

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,500
back to being somebody by the people who

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:44,520
use it use them for the people who use

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,710
them at least to some extent this is

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,370
something that has been happening for

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,080
quite a long time this is the first post

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,270
on

00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:02,130
identica and it happened in 2008 so it's

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:04,530
10 years of sort of social networks it

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,320
was based of course on free software

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:11,010
it could be installed by multiple people

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:15,990
and all instances can I could talk with

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:18,480
each other this worked quite fine of

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:22,560
course it was new software and it had

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,260
problems but the biggest problem was

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,410
that it was a great place that the Fae

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:33,420
diverse or the the universe of all

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:36,510
platforms that allowed to have a social

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:40,290
network presence on your own server that

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:43,560
federates so talks with other people's

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:47,790
service and it was a great place to talk

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:52,370
about federated social networks and tiny

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:56,610
bit about free software and that was it

00:05:52,370 --> 00:06:02,880
the amount of people who were using this

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:05,550
was what little it was it was a fun

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,220
place to be if you were interested in

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,540
federated search on networks and I have

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:16,740
good time met a number of people but if

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:20,810
you had any other interest you were just

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:27,980
looking at something that weren't

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:31,050
available for you so well it-it-it

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:35,010
existed but it didn't solve most people

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:40,770
problems but at least it grew he drew

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:43,819
and new projects were launched at there

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:48,969
was identical there

00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:53,089
friend Iike diaspora where the early

00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:56,379
projects of course they didn't talk with

00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:59,149
each other so if you work on the aspen

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,639
identica you could only talk with people

00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:03,439
on identica if you were on the aspera

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,499
you could only talk with people on the

00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,899
aspera and if you were on friendly car

00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:11,329
you could talk with other people as long

00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,969
as this was explicit supporters in

00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:22,429
friend Lika and as long as it didn't

00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:28,039
break which then time passed and there

00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:30,439
were a few things that happen it the

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,279
first thing was the world of couple of

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:37,309
porn apocalypsis where a proprietary

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,889
social network so decided to ban porn

00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:44,569
affirm their platform or other similar

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:49,629
contents and that helped a lot getting

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:52,849
new users because those new users

00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:56,479
created their own federated social

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:59,479
network instance and they also started

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,110
to talk about other topics so it wasn't

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:05,779
just federated social network and porn

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:13,639
but it became started to became a social

00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:16,579
network cat picture Mesa or anything

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:21,139
else and a bit of porn but it's easy to

00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:25,459
filter it out as you can see well the

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:27,739
the platform that was used a lot for

00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,889
this was Mastodon and mastodons came

00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:34,069
with the content warning of the ability

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,889
to prevent the showing content if you

00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:40,250
don't want to see it which helped with

00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:45,189
having an influx of people who wanted

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:48,110
porn but didn't take over the plaza

00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:51,529
another another thing that Mastodon had

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,829
was the ability to buy some bar to pay

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,640
somebody to host your own instance

00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:58,880
because

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,970
big problem that identica had was that

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,760
everybody was going on it ain't on the

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:11,120
identical server so that wasn't a real

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:15,380
federated the ecosystem everybody was

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,769
just using one server with Macedon a lot

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,620
of people are using the main server must

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:26,750
own that social but there are also a lot

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:29,930
of other instances some of them are big

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:33,589
and created for some specific topic some

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:39,260
are just a few people who decide ok we

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:44,660
want to have our own social network

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:47,209
instance so we are not IT people we are

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,240
Nazis that mean we can pay somebody to

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:54,140
do the sysadmin work and they just do

00:09:50,240 --> 00:10:01,040
the social administrator work so burning

00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:04,600
people listening to people complains the

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,390
other good things that happen it was the

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,190
release of the activity pub

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:15,260
specification which is at least a

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:20,180
standard that allows multiple platforms

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:23,199
to talk to each other it it it has some

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:27,760
problems but it has a huge advantage

00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:31,100
which is it exists and there are a few

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,790
big platforms that are already told

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,430
activity pub mostly muscle then there

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:41,269
were a number of projects smaller

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,430
project born especially last summer it

00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:52,930
was called the summer of activity pub

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:52,930
and they were project like pixel fed

00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:01,870
well a few others which took activity

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:05,540
pub and decided ok I want to make

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:09,040
something that is useful well basically

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,960
I want to make Instagram for about three

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,900
free as in freedom or I want to make a

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,650
blog at the torx activity Park and other

00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:21,590
projects like this there is still one

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:25,850
thing that is missing and it is that

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:30,860
activity bubble as a protocol allows you

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:33,470
to use as a client to server part and

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,360
the server to sell a part most of the

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,850
projects are implementing the service or

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,779
server part one thing that would be good

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,360
to see it start to have clients talking

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:48,080
client to server that could use

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,920
different servers that are may be useful

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:56,980
for major blogging or pictures or

00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:00,680
blogging etc instead of having to have

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:03,020
an account on Maslin if you want to do

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:09,560
makeup blogging on pixel fed if you

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:12,140
wanted to do for to publish photos and

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:19,370
cetera if you want to have a blog or

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:23,540
something else another so we have a

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:26,360
number of projects some of them are

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:30,440
already talking activity pub some are

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,080
older and they are implementing it some

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,890
are still using other protocols the

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,350
aspera will still using the diaspora

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:44,570
portugal another as far as I know they

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:48,740
don't intend to migrate mmm but at least

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:52,970
as far as projects are available it's a

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:55,160
good situation it's quite active people

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,420
are starting to think about doing things

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:05,900
that a commercial entity wouldn't be

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:09,589
doing and it's starting to grow

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:13,610
something more but there is quite a bit

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:18,440
big problem that is that self hosting

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:21,640
such such projects is not easy some of

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:26,410
them are meant for biggish instances

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:29,620
so if they think that you're going to

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:33,760
have a hundred or thousand users at

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:37,170
least if you have just four users you

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:43,870
can do it but it's not really a good

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:47,140
match then they're all web projects with

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:49,480
lots of dependencies and it can be hard

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,350
to install and maintain them and

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,570
maintain them in time without breaking

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:59,350
so it would be nice having them in

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:03,490
Debian but as far as I know the of the

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:07,090
one that old activity pub none of them

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,470
are elevate available all of those RFPs

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,680
are just RFPs

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:17,530
except for the phrenic of one who was an

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:20,620
ITP but was forgotten I don't know if

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:23,020
they're still working I asked it by but

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:28,380
probably too late to be traveling as

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:32,230
well today so I think it would be nice

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,780
maybe to bring to do some effort on that

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,980
part but it's something that is going to

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:42,550
be hard because web packaging what web

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:46,090
project is hard and I have to admit that

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:48,700
I looked at them and I decided to do the

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,090
wrong thing and write my own activity

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,780
pub server which probably will never

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,570
work

00:14:52,780 --> 00:15:00,040
but if you if it will it will be is it

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:02,860
was I should have worked more on

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:09,220
packaging but sometimes people do what

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:18,100
is fun rather than what is useful so if

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:19,930
you have any questions if you want to if

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,200
you consider this important and want to

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,200
help

00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:10,190
thank you but now there is a question

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:14,780
okay hello

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:20,030
more than a question is a comment in the

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:24,080
Debian publicity team publishes the

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:30,110
small news in via micro news dot Debian

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:35,000
dot org but this system creates a atom

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:38,920
feed that can be pushed to different

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:46,400
social networks so for the networks that

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:50,480
Elina explained some people members of

00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:54,260
the Debian publicity team care about the

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:58,660
Debian profile in a certain social

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:05,330
network so we are in Mastodon is in

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:10,810
profile is Debian at foster on.org we

00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:13,310
are also in Tampa with Debian at

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:19,010
identica we are still keeping that

00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:22,550
account and some other people asked

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:27,590
about having a debian profile in all the

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:31,120
networks for example the as per our it

00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:35,750
depends on somebody wanting to maintain

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,830
the account and to keep that the feed is

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:44,840
working and replying if there is any

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:48,080
mention or everything we try to focus in

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:52,430
a micro news so the content is there at

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:56,900
an at the correct time and then we

00:17:52,430 --> 00:18:00,260
invite anybody that wants to maintain a

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:04,200
debian account in any federated social

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:09,600
network to talk with us and to

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:16,510
the publicity team that's all thank you

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:21,039
this was quite important to say you

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:23,169
maybe wanted to do both tomorrow so if

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,620
somebody is interested in talking about

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:28,900
activity pub so we can find a place for

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,320
you and you can discuss all together

00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:35,650
during the Lightning talks or a little

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:41,890
bit after so don't hesitate to go and

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:45,100
see Elena if you want to do this would

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,169
like to you asked who's interested and

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,350
would like to help I am only I don't

00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:54,610
have time so that's a third item missing

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:56,950
but maybe someday do you happen to know

00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,200
because I managed to get rid of all the

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,210
big social networks the only thing I

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,490
can't get rid of is Twitter because

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:07,960
there are too many interesting things

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:12,429
that I don't know how to get from other

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,610
sources is there any thing any one of

00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:18,330
those networks that can just mirror all

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,620
the stuff from me or that I can say

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,809
monitor those Twitter feeds and show

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:31,750
them and I don't want you to give any

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:36,789
data to Twitter from me on Twitter post

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:39,940
on Muslim they're growing a bit more of

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:43,149
course in the contest of contests of

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:47,440
free software technological things at

00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:50,169
the most I don't think there is

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,990
something automatic that takes things

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:56,740
from Twitter and downloads download it

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,789
because that would require somebody to

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,299
maintain it

00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:04,870
while Twitter changes the conditions the

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:09,039
API I think that something has been

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:11,230
tried and mostly failed accelerate

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,899
because you are working with somebody

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:17,800
who doesn't want their content to go

00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:21,130
outside so you should ask

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:26,290
the API is to change your application to

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:30,490
be blocked it may work for some time you

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:33,310
can also try to tell people who are you

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:37,030
you are interested in well why don't you

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:39,570
also post on something else mostly in

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:43,530
that case it will be mastered on its the

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:46,600
four microblogging is the biggest one

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:50,250
there are also tools to post the bot on

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,810
Twitter and mastodons at the same time

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:57,340
there are a number of counts that use

00:20:52,810 --> 00:21:01,330
them and some of them aren't great

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,460
accounts because Marcin they are mostly

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:09,580
read-only but at least at the original

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:11,440
posts are available but yeah it's a hard

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,730
problem because when you are dealing

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:19,720
with somebody who's against who can be

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:23,380
working against you Twitter yeah

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,570
especially I'm following the ongoing

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,640
stuff with Friday's for future and

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,970
climate strike and it makes me worried

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,550
said that especially those people use n

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,650
proprietary not works proprietary chat

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,410
infrastructure everything proprietary

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,630
you may also tell them that on muscle

00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,340
there is quite a big community of people

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:48,480
who are into those problems those issues

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,480
there is a big community of

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:56,350
self-sufficiently eco Anna kissed or

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:58,240
things like that there is an interest

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,350
there are interesting communities on

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,510
non-muslim from a social point of view

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:08,340
and then you had five requests for

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:14,680
packaging box there for the different

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:17,140
systems and have you made a list which

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,880
of those might be the easiest package or

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,000
which are the problems to package so

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,770
that if somebody has time now is ok

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,510
where were the hurdles which is the most

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:32,340
promising to start well

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:35,220
I think the friendly Khmer be good

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:39,390
because it's PHP and as far as I know

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:42,740
there aren't as many dependencies but

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:45,810
then you have to maintain an PHP program

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:49,950
I wouldn't recommend Pompeo

00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:55,680
because I don't know how much develop it

00:22:49,950 --> 00:23:00,450
it is anymore play Rama is also

00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:05,270
promising as long as you know the

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:11,820
language is pretend it would which is

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:15,330
long I think okay okay so as soon as you

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,760
have time you have a volunteer last

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,710
question is there any place in the

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,470
Debian Viki for example where I find

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,050
this list of 5 fps and maybe anything

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,070
else around activity poppin Debian I

00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:34,080
don't think so but I can make one well

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:43,410
maybe tomorrow train the buffer at most

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:48,390
in the next few days you mentioned you

00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:51,510
almost mentioned this idea but so when I

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:55,140
try to convince people using alternative

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,270
social network my and until now I

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,630
recommended yes power because some

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:03,480
instances have this feature that when

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,280
you pass to just power it can also post

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,110
to a Twitter account that you linked and

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,690
a Facebook accounts that you linked and

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,900
do you but the apsara is not going to

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,240
have activity pub soon so do you know

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,660
activity pub social networks who have

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,340
this this picture for forwarding posts

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,230
to linked account on or the social

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,560
network or do you know external tools

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,470
who can post proprietary social network

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,980
and also activity based social networks

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,600
I know that they exist but I don't know

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,670
which one they are because I have never

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,160
used them and they are the ones that

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:40,650
post on Twitter and macedon at the same

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,680
time but I'm only on the receiving

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:46,260
but seeing the possum Muslim so I don't

00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,020
know what the name of the tool is but

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,680
I'm sure that it exists because I'm

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:57,380
saying it use it so we have two more

00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,380
minutes questions

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:22,050
okay thank you alluring there is another

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,420
kind of social network that choose

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,720
activity pub it's called funk whale I

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:31,200
guess the right name it's an alternative

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,180
a replacement for groove shark I don't

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,350
know if it's there or if it just

00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:39,960
proprietor it's dead okay but we would

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,870
have liked to have the the main author

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,630
of the software but it's not here today

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,270
but he's using activity per banned it

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,810
can be blended with the rest of the

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,530
community

00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:56,370
great I didn't know about it so his name

00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:59,220
is Elliott Marriott and Frank whale is

00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,620
like pier tube but for music it's

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,610
exactly the same idea and it's using

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,180
activity pub and since September this

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:12,270
developer is on his own he left his job

00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:14,880
to develop full-time Frank whale so go

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:18,720
and look at his project and he's on open

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:23,430
collectives calm so you can fund his job

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:26,330
his work if you want so Thank You Elena

00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,330
thank you

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,240
