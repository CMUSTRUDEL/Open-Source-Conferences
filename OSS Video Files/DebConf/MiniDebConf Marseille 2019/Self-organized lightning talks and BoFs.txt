about the Hong Kong hold economy which

00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:12,960
is a funny thing but not only funny that

00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:17,740
takes place here in Exxon hormones it's

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,140
you will see it's surprise and maybe we

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,920
have two other talks we'll see if they

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:45,540
decide themselves okay so let's begin

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:45,540
with jean-jacques weekend it's all right

00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:54,030
and my company is doing you see yourself

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,470
kind of stuff or croissant machine and

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,650
we are running debian Bizet the

00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:02,790
distribution customized the distribution

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:05,619
and so we like open source and we

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:14,590
sometimes and of yuri contribute some to

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:16,950
some someone just sorry times ago we

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:21,250
have to to manager or

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,640
our pack of mashing on the the customers

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,159
we have to software to do this and then

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,420
I will present you software we are agree

00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:40,019
to deliberate and truly so what is this

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:40,019
software it's a very lightweight sorry I

00:02:41,069 --> 00:03:07,389
don't use to not touch my nothing to you

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:11,889
but difficult to make controlled shift

00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:15,069
with only one hands you know yes we have

00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:17,819
I have we have produce a little

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:26,620
lightweight we are ready to distribute

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:29,010
the software is yes so I just ready

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,290
domain page is arrow

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,989
we do not know but under only is only

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,440
kind of software do the stuff we note at

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:47,590
the time was space work and it was too

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:52,379
easy for us so we so it's a little it's

00:03:47,590 --> 00:04:00,159
a little software that overlay Appetit -

00:03:52,379 --> 00:04:02,109
yes - - to automatically get the

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,900
configuration we decided on our

00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:15,970
infrastructure for the customer and from

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:23,770
our developer machine so that's our main

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:25,750
command we use for example and we have

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,570
so some nice features like the chicken

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,270
fix we use a startup which very useful

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,800
way example when you

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,650
there is a poker during your in a bread

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:42,820
I check it to continue to restoration

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:45,220
and go back and it's really comparing to

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,470
to do conformation so no I know unstable

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,710
and I should know it before maybe I did

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,850
not make this off I know it before but

00:04:50,710 --> 00:05:00,190
it's very light lighter than than spicy

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:08,880
I know unstable you will use it I will

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:11,970
show you by the demo on my machine

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,970
[Music]

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:29,110
yes so very few very few configuration

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:35,400
option as there is a lot some more we

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:39,160
can do only by coffee config files and

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,740
the main main things is a server a cat a

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,750
server and you don't if you and things

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,669
are very simple I will show you the cat

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:53,080
I suppose we could be anything anywhere

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:56,020
it should be our zone so we are a

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,710
rotatory one of our history we are using

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,690
web Pro pro we are using so different

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,800
repository with some to be on me roles

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:08,350
and some package that overlay what is in

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,540
DB on my roster so we have the question

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:16,180
is a package that may that samsung has

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,750
only no distribution and some of the

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,750
repackaged

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,930
but we don't like we're going to do this

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,300
because it's it's kind of folk and we

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,700
have to maintain it and we don't

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:37,150
necessary of the Russos to to to

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:41,490
maintaining so what a server do is just

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,490
here in ready

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:48,780
you know that some configuration from a

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:53,380
development project and if for example

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:57,190
if I go and this thing or predict like

00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:03,820
this at this point quite sample these

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:05,950
days no it was extra file I and there is

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:10,450
the list of package we are checking

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:13,740
should be on your distribution just and

00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:20,410
this is on the same servers than the

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:22,090
cattle but this is a this could be

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,770
anywhere else it could be on the local

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,780
machines it could be just a

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,870
configuration to have a list of package

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,930
and there is some other extra you see I

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,830
use the extra comment in debian sauce

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:39,130
list to to make extra extra do a cliff -

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,250
Maya - Maya software and also download

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,620
extra packages and there is some you see

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:48,070
the source types there is often to do

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,900
prints because between in the field we I

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,050
could check from signature from what

00:07:49,900 --> 00:08:12,780
package are are are received to check

00:07:53,050 --> 00:08:17,320
them so and no that's so if I do see -

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:19,419
there is completion I could add the list

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,229
to my package configuration available

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:25,600
from Earth so you see I can switch my

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:28,389
distribution to configuration to report

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,660
configuration through an easel because

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:33,789
you somewhere is oh it's so lucky

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,729
because it will use a report like Y

00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:39,430
depend you can switch it to to an e so

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,430
to get on an aversion to debugger to

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:51,910
debugger a null version of product at

00:08:42,430 --> 00:09:00,970
software and I can switch easily for

00:08:51,910 --> 00:09:03,300
example for doing the testing project

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,300
develop

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:17,259
yes and there is so authentic Asian

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,470
because to get this list and custom it's

00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:23,199
useless with the extra information we

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:29,439
character not because of some sun

00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:32,560
protection some machine cannot cannot to

00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:38,589
get an intern tears as they say they are

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:43,000
forbidden to do it so so it's only yes

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:45,040
there is no no question asked it because

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,259
it should it should run on production

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,660
machine and because some 12 my

00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:51,550
colleagues also don't like you're 12

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,470
question don't know how to to response

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,019
they are not they've been an instructor

00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:02,970
and they may be is some of them don't

00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:02,970
use the debian only to to to to develop

00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:18,389
another or maybe I will consider it

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,010
because it's up

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:34,550
I don't have the same modestly if you

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,990
would check here maybe I should I think

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,670
it's broken

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,410
and the chicken things will fix it we

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:50,310
continue installation one minute okay

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:51,930
no yes you see the package the meta

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,540
package just specify your acoustic

00:10:51,930 --> 00:11:03,420
configuration is instead but some

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:07,850
package ah salad and it's which I can

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:13,470
fix we fix this so confuse things you

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:15,720
have something so it's such kind of

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,320
feature I would like maybe to to have in

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,870
Appetit

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:28,529
I don't know if I not have know if there

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:31,709
exists no no you're not know if can

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,410
search item feature exists and with and

00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:41,089
it could be fine to have such features

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:41,089
on it's alright

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,209
any question

00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:05,350
[Applause]

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:09,160
so now is it time we had a lot of fun

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:14,860
with it with it talking about you are in

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:17,260
a DD procedure to become a DJ or no it's

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:22,680
okay yes but we had fun talking about

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,680
that so I give you five minutes

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
yeah

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:16,470
okay first I wanted to yeah first I

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:20,040
wanted to redo the office she but anyone

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:23,760
is able to reset this anyway so I will

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:27,230
read from the Debian Constitution I will

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,200
just jump right to the general rules

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,880
first nothing in this Constitution

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,850
imposes an obligation on anyone to do

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,220
work for the project a person who does

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,100
not want to do a task which has been

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,190
assigned or delegated to them does not

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,140
need to do it it's quite pretty cool if

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,810
you're part of the video team and don't

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:53,910
feel like operating the camera you just

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:56,550
can leave or if you're a pressure and

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,550
don't like to do account accounting work

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:02,790
you know I don't need to do it okay this

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:05,340
is boring boring boring oh this is good

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,250
okay it's just interesting if you are

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:11,100
the DPL so if one of you is the DPL

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:14,790
there should listen the leader cannot

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,260
appoint himself as their own delegate so

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,610
if you did this it's against the

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:23,520
Constitution and third one a person may

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,250
leave the project it's really true so if

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:30,230
you become didi this doesn't mean you

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:33,120
sign a contract with the devil or

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,720
resigned from a particular post they

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,240
hold at any time by stating so publicly

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,880
this is what I'm doing now I accepted

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,950
the task to hold this lightning talk but

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,090
I don't want to do it and I'm stating so

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:57,239
publicly thank you

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:57,239
[Applause]

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:12,600
yes you do okay because it's election

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:20,160
day Thomas we'll talk about that I

[Music]

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,480
thank you okay

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,640
today is election day in the European

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,910
Union so it's about election democracy

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,660
european union i'm thk at debian or who

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:24,050
try at history knowledge for citizens

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,580
this claim i will hurt any feelings or

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,330
previous knowledge you might be

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,120
disturbed

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,790
I'm sorry for that I can't help it so

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,160
I'm in France I'm a German sorry if I

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:39,710
say anything about friends as a German

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:43,040
here but as wikipedia says Liberty

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:47,450
liberty equality fraternity was only one

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,450
motto among others and only later it was

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,850
it became the official motto so they

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,150
rewrote history and this is what I

00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:00,650
learned in school in my history class

00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,930
and only when I was in Moscow in a

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:08,230
history museum they told me no this was

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:13,670
not true and then I also learnt that the

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:16,520
Declaration of Rights the first one has

00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,430
a big stamp on property that's the

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,760
important stuff

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:24,600
now that people actually have the right

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,740
to own something and that it's not a oil

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,290
system anymore

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,360
where with your property also comes

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:34,620
responsibility property is now the

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:38,340
important thing so next in history the

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,930
USA it has been found out

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,240
surprisingly is that it is not a

00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:47,790
democracy and it can be measured

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:50,340
they took 1779 policy issues over two

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:54,690
decades and measured how many of those

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:57,300
issues were decided in the sense of the

00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,630
majority or for those rich people and

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,330
surprised it was always most of the time

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:09,450
decided for the rich people not for the

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:13,770
majority and there you can find YouTube

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:17,760
talks from Michael G clammin and his

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:21,360
book of course who explains how the US

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,970
Constitution became the way it is and it

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,150
was designed especially to not be

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:30,030
democratic but to protect the rich and

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:34,890
powerful people from the will of the

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:37,500
majority but to hide it and yeah what

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,630
else my father always told me democracy

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,810
is the best thing that could ever be

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:46,080
invented which is a lie because people

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:49,380
thought about a Counsel's republic also

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,760
in wikipedia called soviet republic to

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,980
make it sound scary and important things

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,440
are you have an imperative mandate

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,350
people you send out you tell them how

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,510
they should decide and you can recall

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:07,350
them at any point in time if you lose

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,930
trust in them and yeah this has been

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,330
tried in history it has been tried in

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:15,660
paris' it has been shut down by the pros

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:19,320
I'm sorry for that it has been tried

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,810
again afterward were once in Munich it

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,700
has been shot down by Social Democrats

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:30,800
and it has been tried many more times

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,950
and all of them has been shot down

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,340
and I have learned about none of these

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:41,990
events in history class but you can

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:44,600
still look them up in Wikipedia you only

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:47,780
need to know about them the other thing

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,180
you could try is direct democracy it is

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,360
present in some of the Constitution's of

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:57,260
our lender of our 60 lenders in Germany

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,860
but not in the Constitution in the quant

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,190
Cosette's

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,750
of the Federal Republic of Germany

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,240
because they were afraid that the

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:09,560
Germans could vote to unite with East

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,690
Germany and become true Democratic yeah

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,270
and the current we don't have a

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,600
constitution in Germany because our one

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:20,390
Cosette's said we should get a

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,460
constitution voted on by whole of

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,070
Germany once we unite this hasn't

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,770
happened in 1990 and so we have

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,450
something that is not foreseen by the

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:34,370
fathers of the grand Cosette's

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:36,500
and yeah I learned in politics that you

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:41,150
should separate legislative executive

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:44,570
and judiciary powers to get a real

00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,070
democratic system that are the people

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,430
you can look up for that the

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:53,300
Philosopher's and in the European you

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:57,740
need we don't have that the European

00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:02,360
Parliament has no right of initiative it

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:05,030
can not say we want this bill to be

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,240
voted on only the European Commission

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:11,870
can say you Parliament vote on this bill

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,430
and the Parliament can only ask the

00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,340
Commission please please would you be so

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,840
kind to let us vote on something and the

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,100
Commission session are we are all

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,730
knowledge is the Commission is not

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:27,440
elected democracy democratic it is

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,510
appointed by the governments of the

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,330
states of the European Union if that

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,310
means you vote a government you want a

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,500
Parliament the Parliament votes a

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:39,500
government the government appoints a

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,140
commission at the Commission then says

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,809
writes the bills that the Parliament

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,409
that you

00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:48,210
vote today on 10 yeah this is so much

00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:53,759
indirection it has nothing to do with

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:55,919
democracy yeah the fastest explanation

00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,769
of capitalism it's a private ownership

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,470
of means to produce goods the private

00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:04,529
ownership media the private ownership of

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,499
essential infrastructure and the

00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:10,139
European Union has been designed to

00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:12,509
protect capitalism and to make sure that

00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:14,549
none of the countries of Europe will

00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:17,789
ever become anything else but

00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:19,769
capitalistic and it does so by

00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:23,070
guaranteeing the free movement of goods

00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:26,249
to avoid local laws the free movement of

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:28,499
capital to avoid local taxation the free

00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:31,379
movement of services to avoid us

00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:34,470
creating unions so that you can always

00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:37,679
have work being done by somebody else

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:41,369
and the free movement of persons so that

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,490
we can always get the cheapest Romanians

00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:48,570
or ball game Brewer gariands pulling

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:52,860
down our salaries and yeah any hope

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:56,480
after this I have I like the yellow

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:59,429

we have Friday's for future which is

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:07,259
also rather strong in Germany and they

00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:10,399
had 320,000 people on the street

00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:13,499
yesterday we have this rebellion

00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,450
extensional rebellion movement we have

00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:19,440
developers for future if you are

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:23,129
interested in that and the the Friday's

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:27,360
for future call for a general start in

00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:30,269
the whole world on September 20th to get

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,049
us away from climate crisis and our

00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:36,080
current trajectory two minutes left for

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:36,080
questions

00:26:48,499 --> 00:27:03,440
it's possible of the first right second

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:28,919
okay

00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:35,720
don't centers to any secret service okay

00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,720
then yeah happy voting

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,999
[Applause]

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:54,739
okay so surprise talk but I fed her dog

00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:55,759
who will maybe talk about the way of

00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,759
elections

00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:27,409
the way elections go in Debian which is

00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:30,649
a Condorcet method I think I was hoping

00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:33,499
that Tama would speak a bit about how we

00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:36,830
elect people in Debian but he did not so

00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:38,779
I'm going to try to explain it a bit but

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,989
first I will explain why it's important

00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:45,019
to know how we do it in Devon because at

00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:49,009
least in France we have a good system

00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:52,039
where the biggest minority is always

00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:55,580
winning and since the biggest minority

00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:59,960
as always annoying people we always have

00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:03,409
to what for something uninteresting you

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,269
know in France we elect where we have

00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:09,399
many candidates at the first round and

00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:11,389
so many people with the same ideas but

00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,409
since there are different people in

00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:18,590
contact we together they go in separate

00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:22,190
candidates and then the boats are spread

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:25,129
over many candidates but only the two

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,960
better candidates have the right to go

00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:29,350
to the second round and on second run

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,440
Jeon revs to choose between two

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:37,039
unfortunately the two biggest minorities

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:41,509
tends to be well racist people and

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,739
extremists and otherwise what kind of

00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,989
people they don't know that I do not

00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:53,210
like so I have to vote between two bad

00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:54,110
choice nowadays we have computers we

00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,450
have good

00:29:54,110 --> 00:30:00,679
we have intelligent people and there are

00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:04,490
better ways to elect people but we don't

00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:09,920
use them I will present you at least two

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:12,530
ways to elect people first one is what

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,520
you use in Debian it's called second or

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:21,380
semi toad it's relatively easy to

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:24,740
understand not so easy to make the count

00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,750
at the end of the election so basically

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,970
you have all your candidates and you

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,299
rank them this is my preferred and my

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,760
second choice or choice you can have

00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:37,250
multiple choice ranked at the same level

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,679
sometimes your four candidates you don't

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,570
know you put them last but at least you

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,049
don't make any preference between them

00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,600
because you have no real preference and

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:52,429
to find out the winner

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,860
you make comparison to pie - so you go

00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:58,100
over all the votes and you check how

00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:01,760
many times this choice this Connie rate

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:05,299
was ranked above the other one ideally

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,370
there's one candidate who is above all

00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:14,299
the others and usually that's the case

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:18,710
but usually that candidate is possibly

00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:21,260
or likely not the preferred choice well

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,150
it might be more the second choice of

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,580
many people instead of the third choice

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:30,530
of few if you see what I mean the

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,549
candidate will be more consensual it

00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:45,440
will be less extremist it will be a mix

00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:47,270
of many views usually so this is a good

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,090
system unfortunately there are a few

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:54,130
exceptions where you don't have any

00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:56,780
clear winner you can have candidate I is

00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:59,150
preferred of a candidate B is preferable

00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,780
candidate C is preferred over candidate

00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,670
a a again so it's a loop so there are

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:10,670
special rules too

00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:13,880
to resolve the sky and here comes into

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,130
play how many times you were ranked

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,770
number one remember two and double

00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:22,130
figures will count to find out who is

00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:30,530
who will win the election between this

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:33,850
tie recently for the presidential

00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,720
election in France I participated

00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:40,490
participated to something which is

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:46,480
called la primera oak so bad its primary

00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:49,240
election the idea was to have many

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:55,490
candidates but not politicians

00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:58,310
individuals like you and me and they

00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:02,000
wanted to select one among all those to

00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:06,400
represent the people and not a political

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:13,100
party that we all know and they use the

00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:15,380
new voting system where it's quite

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:19,400
similar because you evaluate all the

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:22,040
candidates but you give a sort of mark

00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,230
this one is very good this one is good

00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:28,430
this one is middle it went bad and this

00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:33,860
one is really bad and in this situation

00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:37,000
the one which wins is one was the better

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:43,430
mark when you count

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,830
well obviously everybody has had been

00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:49,790
wronged by everybody but you count on a

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:52,160
mini percent of the voters have given

00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,950
you well you start from the bottom

00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:00,920
so very bad you have ten percent for

00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:05,780
example then bad 20% you are 30 and then

00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:10,640
you have good 25 you are 55 percent when

00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:12,530
you cross the 50 person Park is your is

00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,960
your final mark if you want in these

00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,840
guys you are well middle or good

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,390
candidate and

00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,700
the Connie died with a better mark is

00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,820
the one wins in two candidates have the

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:28,720
same mark then you look at the precise

00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,550
person percentage that you got it's

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,000
similar in spirit but it's easier to

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:36,540
maybe explain because well you just have

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,270
to say what you think about if candidate

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:45,580
but at the end it comes close to ranking

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:48,310
all the candidates in this experiment

00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,310
there are so many candidates that well

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,870
there are two rounds usually you don't

00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,070
need that if you're wrong everybody but

00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,810
when you have too many candidates you

00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:01,780
can't rank everybody

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:04,540
so what's I did is that we were all

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,430
voters were given a subset of all the

00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,410
candidates and we had to average a

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:14,950
subset and then they put this together

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:16,930
and we dint if I'd a few winners from

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:20,050
from the first round and then the second

00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:26,860
round we had to vote only among the

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:31,180
winners of the first round so I invite

00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:35,110
you to think about this but on a

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:37,690
personal level my number one criteria

00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:40,690
for deciding who I'm going to vote for

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:43,480
is as I'm willing to change the rule

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,490
because the rules are broken and I

00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,060
really want something else that's my

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:52,060
first criteria and I invite you to use

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:57,370
the same criteria because well we need

00:35:52,060 --> 00:36:00,040
to change the situation thank you and if

00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:02,860
you need a second criteria I would go

00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,020
for basic income if you know about it

00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:12,180
but maybe someone else can present this

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:12,180
in the next lighting talk thank you

00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,260
if you want more information about this

00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,230
kind of systems on YouTube you can find

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,930
CGP grey it's a channel which is done

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,630
alone a few very good videos explaining

00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,130
those voting system with the good and

00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,240
bad aspects of everyone's house

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:44,370
each one is very very interesting CGP

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:51,420
grey like the color french i think it's

00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:55,860
a silent six explain to cut in case

00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:58,980
where you well it took a special case

00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:01,280
where we any tried the different methods

00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,930
and you get a different result for each

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,340
voting system and sent interesting to

00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:14,790
know the limits of all the systems in

00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:26,900
france italy statistics promotion are

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:26,900
other questions so now we yes it's soon

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:35,150
ready for 10 minutes yes

00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:38,870
hi everyone I'm going to talk about Lux

00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:42,260
Lux and looks too basically that's about

00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:46,210
encryption it was a bit mentioned in the

00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:49,600
talk yesterday about hardening the

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:52,130
Debian installation we mentioned

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,820
equipped and I'm going to talk about

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:59,660
another technology which is Lux Lux is

00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:02,720
basically Linux unified key setup it's a

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,960
bit abstract but basically that's make

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,260
it possible to work on containers that

00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,420
are fully encrypted we work on a block

00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,640
device level which means basically that

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:18,380
we are working on a disk or partition

00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:21,950
but not on specific file systems we're

00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:24,560
going to create what is called a

00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:28,700
container and then we are going to use

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:32,810
this decrypted container as a file

00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:37,820
system and then we can use a VM or XFS

00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:39,790
or vfat or whatever you like that

00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,930
basically makes it possible to have

00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:48,530
encryption on a full disk which is great

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:51,770
here is a screenshot from the db9 solar

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:55,010
running in graphical mode when you ask

00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:57,230
how you want to partition your disk by

00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:59,390
default we go for the very first entry

00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:02,030
which is guided partitioning using the

00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,910
entire disk it's also possible to use

00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,520
the entire disk but to set up LVM so

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:10,250
that you can resize your partitions and

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,880
the third option is to use the entire

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:17,690
disk use LVM but with encryption

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:22,730
underneath that means that first you set

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:26,120
up or you Debian installer does the

00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:29,990
encryption library set up and then we

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:32,870
have the LVM system which is set up on

00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,940
top of it and then one also all

00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:39,140
partitions are going to be set up with

00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:42,250
appropriate file systems this is great

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,240
we can check what's happening when we

00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:47,750
want to boot

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:51,940
such a system once it has a V it has

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,940
been installed oh sorry about that

00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:06,650
so my system is booting and right after

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:11,090
grab as had is its usual timeout and

00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:13,670
booting the Linux kernel we then run the

00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:18,860
init 1 FS which is a bunch of scripts

00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:21,920
and Linux kernel modules and so on that

00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:27,320
sets up the whole file system mounts

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:30,380
everything we need to finalize the the

00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:34,430
boot process and then I'm asked for the

00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:41,950
passphrase to unlock the the encrypted

00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:46,040
container that I mentioned before and

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:50,120
after a while because many security

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:54,050
stuff related operation going on and so

00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:55,700
on the part the container is unlocked

00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,400
we access the file systems and we can

00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:01,970
finish the boot sequence and we finally

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,120
reach the usual screen so everything is

00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:08,630
great the talk is already over or

00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:11,390
something like that no because it's not

00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:14,060
really for disk encryption due to

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:18,320
previous limitations in boot loaders it

00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:21,200
was not possible to have the boot loader

00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:25,520
decrypt all the files it needed to boot

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,640
like the Linux kernel the Anitra me face

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,070
and so on so historically we've been

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,670
using a separate slash boot partition

00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:37,839
when we use encrypted LVM this is a

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:40,779
screen with departed looking at

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,269
of the disk image I'm using for this

00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:48,489
demonstration and you can notice that

00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:52,150
the first part is separate that's a good

00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:54,609
partition and the second one is what is

00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,859
being used as the lux container so when

00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:59,200
you unlock the container that's the

00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:02,049
second part and the first one is in

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,930
plain text so anybody can look at your

00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:07,359
kernel in it from FS bootloader

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:11,259
configuration and so on so it's not

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:16,210
really that great and then if you look

00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:20,219
at the small tree the second partition

00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:25,200
so number two is extended it contains

00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:29,950
locks container which itself is used as

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:32,710
a physical volume for LVM which is then

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,690
split into your bits and pieces but you

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,680
can see that in gparted because it's

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:42,910
encrypted anyway so that was for the bad

00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,799
news but then good news it's actually

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:48,009
possible to reach for disk encryption

00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:49,989
because for quite a number of releases

00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:53,469
I'm not sure exactly when it started but

00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:57,130
nobody worked on implementing that into

00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:59,829
GI but grab does know about crypto disk

00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:05,170
it can deal with locks on Linux and

00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:07,299
jelly on FreeBSD and as I said it's not

00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:09,130
really new but nobody worked on

00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:11,589
integrating that into Debian installer

00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,930
and deepening solar is really making

00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:16,329
very hard for you not to have a separate

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:19,029
boot partition so you need to maybe use

00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:21,489
proceed to work around all the checks we

00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:25,779
have to actually make sure you have a

00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:28,569
separate boot partition but we can hack

00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:30,969
hack hack I'm going to let down the mic

00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:32,950
for a moment because I've got a series

00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:37,289
of commands to run but basically what

00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:42,190
I'm doing is that will be extra great

00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:43,410
thank you so I'm going I'm going back to

00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:47,670
my

00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:55,770
to my virtual machine I turned it off

00:44:47,670 --> 00:45:05,460
because a brainless do to do it i unlock

00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:08,730
the partition it boots I login I'm going

00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,220
to copy the whole /boot directory so

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:14,670
it's living on a separate partition I'm

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,710
going to make a copy on the root

00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:21,000
filesystem under a different name so

00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:24,270
that it stays around so booted new when

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,140
I'm and mounting the file system so at

00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:31,490
this point slash boot is empty I'm going

00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:36,359
to remove the mount the mount point and

00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:41,210
move back the copy into place it just to

00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:45,539
make sure I'm not doing wrong stuff with

00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:49,680
file permission and so on and then I

00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:54,359
make sure that I comment or completely

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:57,420
delete the moon point in FS tab so that

00:45:54,359 --> 00:46:00,930
we are going we are no longer going to

00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:03,240
use slash boot from the plain text first

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:06,900
partition we are going to use the copy

00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:10,349
we made inside the the root filesystem

00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:13,170
so I'm getting rid of these separate Mon

00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:16,920
points and the trick here is to

00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:21,680
configure a new variable in I'm not sure

00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:24,359
whether that's hopefully that's readable

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:29,339
I'm going to set an extra variable which

00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:33,650
is grab enable crypto disk equals y for

00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:36,029
yes I'm going to update grabs

00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,819
configuration just to make sure so with

00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:42,359
a bit grab but the critical part is

00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:44,670
running robin soul on dev as yay so that

00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:48,779
in reinstall all the bits and pieces it

00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:53,480
needs okay I'm going to move that up a

00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:53,480
bit is it not quite

00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:59,130
it's tricky with villians so basically

00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:02,670
that was update grab and then grab in

00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:04,710
Seoul those commands I've run anyway

00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:08,010
when you install a new kernel and so on

00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,930
but I'm making extra sure that my latest

00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:14,330
modifications are taken into

00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:14,330
consideration and then we booting

00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:23,400
now that's grub asking me for pathways

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,470
and no longer grab all the con or odd in

00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,470
each one FS it's really the bootloader

00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,260
you have to be careful to type your

00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:38,640
passphrase in QWERTY and not your

00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:40,590
regular layout which can be tricky if

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,190
you have accents or whatever

00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:47,010
now grub is loading and then loading

00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:49,140
Linux and then the Anitra methods

00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:51,210
because I didn't do any more advanced

00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,610
tricks is asking me for the password

00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:55,500
again but the partition is already

00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,810
unlocked so you can just type the

00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:03,180
password again with your regular layout

00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:06,450
and tada so you it is possible to have

00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:08,760
full disk encryption but if you look at

00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,590
a buster it's no longer possible because

00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,870
we switch to locks too which is a

00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:17,130
different format I'm really short on

00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:22,350
time but basically we've got to deal

00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:25,650
with my computer no longer wants to show

00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:28,680
you more slides so anyway it comes with

00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:30,900
Jason in addition to binary errors so

00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,090
it's a bit scary but I'm managing and

00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,910
hopefully in a few weeks we should have

00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:38,790
something in grab at least for people to

00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:40,110
try if they are so crazy to do so thank

00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:48,910
you so much

00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:52,040
[Applause]

00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:59,860
so maybe we can take questions at the

00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:59,860
end or during the during marketing style

00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,850
do you have questions

00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:20,300
yes so the question is no where is the

00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:26,000
code which does decryption so in in ufi

00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:28,490
systems yeah I could guess in the vise

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,500
partition you could have a lot more code

00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:35,600
that can do that but on MBR system does

00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,210
it work on your system it seemed to be

00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:42,190
according to the gparted screenshot it

00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:46,100
was that that works on Umbreon systems

00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:48,620
without any tricks because probably grub

00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:52,010
is not enough to stash all the bits and

00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:55,880
pieces it needs at the right place on

00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:58,520
efi system we might run into issues with

00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,890
boot order needing more space but then

00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:04,010
you don't have necessarily stuff into

00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:07,250
the ESP so the system partition for EFI

00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:09,050
systems but you've got another more

00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:12,410
partition that is really recommended

00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:15,350
especially by web developers that's

00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:18,260
called BIOS boot partition they

00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:20,720
recommend at least 64 kilobytes but

00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:24,620
usually I use just one megabyte chose to

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:29,780
be exposure and then the grab has some

00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:34,820
extra space to to put bits and pieces it

00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:38,630
would need to access stuff because it it

00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:41,720
wouldn't fit into the small areas that

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:44,810
we have in efi systems so it's already

00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:48,410
taken into account on efi systems with

00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,420
the bios boot partition and on MBR

00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,280
systems

00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,589
is everything on the first sectors of

00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,650
the disk everything can fit really

00:50:55,589 --> 00:51:02,940
not sure where it fits but it does and

00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:06,539
I'm working on adding some more code and

00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,489
I'm hoping it won't overflow and that

00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:11,249
was one of the big challenge is adding

00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:15,119
some JSON library and thankfully there

00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:33,390
are some of the implementation using C

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:36,749
macros so that works better so you're

00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:39,329
just now that like DNA test F RAM is

00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:42,450
encrypted grub isn't so you're moving

00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:44,640
the point of attack to modifying the

00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:46,440
grub code if somebody accesses your own

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,130
so then the solution would be to use

00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,799
something like heads for the that uses

00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:56,479
the TPM chip to see if grub has been

00:51:52,799 --> 00:52:00,509
modified or not right I guess with

00:51:56,479 --> 00:52:03,960
secure boots you get your sure that grip

00:52:00,509 --> 00:52:06,029
was on 25 because we need anyway okay

00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,009
but that for that you need to have a

00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:11,640
chip that supports that kind of stuff

00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:13,979
yeah I'm not going to pretend I know

00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,380
anything about security it was like

00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:20,279
people getting upset oh we can't do that

00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:26,489
anymore oh why oh it's bad but yeah I

00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:30,690
want to fix stuff model the attack model

00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:35,869
is not really any part of with which I'm

00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:35,869
comfortable anyway so people will know

00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:46,440
okay now a very short and non-technical

00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:48,839
talk I promised a hundred ninety two

00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:55,410
seconds which depends on your questions

00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:58,499
so anybody uses probably Android phones

00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:03,450
apart from me and some of you are using

00:52:58,499 --> 00:53:08,130
conversations as a chat program and some

00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:16,040
of us managed to get our parents and

00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:20,490
and other family to use XMPP that way so

00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:24,030
that's mainly because everybody loves

00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:29,370
end to end encryption and thus Omaima

00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:34,710
which is the modern style of encryption

00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:36,780
for XMPP or rubber and the nice thing

00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:40,350
about it it's mainly it works with

00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:42,930
multiple devices including your own

00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:46,170
multi devices multiple devices other

00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:48,720
people's multiple devices and it only it

00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:51,690
also works if the other person is

00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:58,650
offline which was very important which

00:53:51,690 --> 00:54:00,780
was not possible with OTR and the MIMO

00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,600
algorithm and the technology is taken

00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:10,620
from signal which probably most of you

00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:12,510
know in Debian 9 we have exactly one

00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:18,300
client supporting Omaima which is

00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:21,180
dashing nice but not everybody wants to

00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:25,290
use dead rim it's a little bit more

00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:28,740
technical and fortunately in Debian 10

00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:31,260
there are more clients to choose from

00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,910
apart from grad room there's Dino which

00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:37,800
looks a little bit like conversations

00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:39,660
only for the desktop there's C+ yeah

00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,950
also an older client

00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:49,370
there's salewa tois which has command

00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:51,720
line and a console client and now in

00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:55,140
experimental verse also the latest

00:54:51,720 --> 00:55:01,710
profanity version a console client -

00:54:55,140 --> 00:55:02,780
which does support a MIMO now we need

00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:06,900
your help

00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:12,270
mainly document stuff

00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:13,680
packet things there is still some stuff

00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:16,770
for a memo to package for example

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:21,150
support for patron or for parity the

00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:21,930
client for for the Librium 5 phone you

00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,540
can do

00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:27,180
screen shots you can do tests especially

00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:30,839
with a memo sometimes one-to-one works

00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:34,500
but group threat does not work or other

00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:38,069
problems please test this and report box

00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:43,369
try things and yeah you find more

00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:43,369
information on our wiki that's it

00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:59,250
any questions just as a note the version

00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:01,500
four of OTS which brought multiple

00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,160
devices and offline messaging but I

00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:07,500
don't know how how much the process is

00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:11,790
advanced before actual usability were in

00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:14,280
white skill I also about it but I'm not

00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:30,049
an expert on this yeah let's hope it

00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:34,770
will work other questions just oh sorry

00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:38,130
what is required on XMPP servers to

00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:41,609
support this the one specifically wants

00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:44,700
packaged in Debian yeah on the server

00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:49,770
side everything is there the server only

00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:51,710
needs to support Ted which is a standard

00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:55,109
that exists since a long time so

00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:57,440
practically all more or less modern

00:56:55,109 --> 00:57:01,140
processor tea or eat raw bodies

00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:12,230
installations do support me more well so

00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:12,230
there's not much to do okay next one

00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:26,470
next one is Siva and we also have a last

00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,470
one after Silva and that's all

01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:07,120
do you hear me

01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:09,550
okay so first huge thanks to the video

01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:14,800
team for having the display port adapter

01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:17,080
that that was life-saving so this it

01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:21,160
would be in English this is a recycling

01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:23,140
of a talk made in a French event and I'm

01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,450
just recycling my part and we will tie

01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,520
in English and we'll see how it goes so

01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:30,940
the name of all talks you know in French

01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:35,260
was Payton really pay you

01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:38,950
Libre software so at this part we were

01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:42,130
saying well some we could think it will

01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:47,980
never work nobody will give but actually

01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:51,160
in other in all the fields there is hope

01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:55,600
for example video channels due to change

01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:58,150
in the dominant business models about

01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,360
the rules especially in YouTube many

01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:03,630
wanted to get out of dependencies of

01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:07,060
publicity and there is on a huge

01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:10,240
proprietary platform named patreon which

01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:15,100
is quite popular there are more than 600

01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:17,200
channels which get at least 2000 US

01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:20,500
dollar per month and about podcast I

01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,720
found that more than 500 channels that

01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:26,580
get more than 200 dollars per month so

01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:28,750
this is working direct remuneration

01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:32,560
recurring payment is something that is

01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:35,220
working in all the fields but the caveat

01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:39,750
is that often there are counterparts

01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:42,580
bonus content so not open access but

01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:45,070
most of the time is is that but about

01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:48,130
Libre software there's no there's no

01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:53,500
direct counterpart so what can we do to

01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:56,080
compensate transparency to see that what

01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:59,560
we are actually contributing to that we

01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:03,100
are not alone to be assured it because

01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:05,350
it could be suspicions and what can help

01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:08,320
it would be a progress bar to see that

01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:10,420
yes we are going to this goal which who

01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,410
can can pay something something

01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:14,680
something

01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:22,210
part-time salary full-time salary

01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:25,569
including health insurance all the other

01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:27,369
stuff that and also the amounts are

01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:29,680
usually bigger that we can see because

01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:33,839
it's the raw celery that what the

01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:37,509
company have to pay so we should not be

01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:40,119
offended and seeing someone five hundred

01:06:37,509 --> 01:06:41,799
five thousand dollars per month that's a

01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:43,299
lot not actually actually in many

01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:46,720
countries that's what you have to pay to

01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:50,410
have everything covered for someone so

01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:53,950
one example is the platform this route

01:06:50,410 --> 01:07:01,230
which have a report when we can see the

01:06:53,950 --> 01:07:01,230
expense and what is happening okay

01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:18,009
and you can see that the expense the

01:07:15,809 --> 01:07:19,990
incomes and then you see that in the

01:07:18,009 --> 01:07:23,230
ends are even turn eighteen to upstream

01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:26,680
projects another one is nozzle new which

01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:29,049
is for hosting tour servers this route

01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:31,980
is hosting email is a provider of email

01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:34,509
and cloud and and also online services

01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:37,690
we can see that there are progress bar

01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:39,549
and they say if we have more than this

01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:41,140
we will open a new relay if you are less

01:07:39,549 --> 01:07:44,680
than this we have to close the relay so

01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:46,450
it's it's a material but you still can

01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,069
have these fields that you get something

01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:50,920
when you're done and this is important

01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:54,069
to motivating to to donate to this

01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:57,039
project another project is funk well and

01:07:54,069 --> 01:08:00,039
you can see that yeah we want to fund

01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,049
the Deaf salary and as I use the

01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:04,180
platform open collective for doing this

01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:10,240
project which is like mastodons for

01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:16,319
music and so I'm going back to the

01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:16,319
slides which is somewhere

01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:25,230
okay up so no I want to finance it's not

01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,660
about donation it's not about charity

01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:32,760
it's about buying our software when it's

01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:38,130
indirect it's it's not it's a non non

01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:40,050
monetary payment which can be out of pay

01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:42,240
what you want and you can pay after

01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:44,670
using the software as a consumer this is

01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,890
a dream we wish we should be wanting to

01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:48,859
have everything that works with this

01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:52,380
model so when there are software we

01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:54,359
which are working like this which would

01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:57,750
be giving on one in priority to them

01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:59,760
otherwise advertising the I witnessing

01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:02,580
one model will prey on the proprietary

01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,530
model will win so now we want to give

01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,180
I'm throwing money on screen and nothing

01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:13,950
happens what can I do

01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:17,330
several platform Libre pay which which

01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:21,290
you can see you you have you have teams

01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:25,589
you have organizations you have

01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:30,060
individuals and and you can then say I

01:09:25,589 --> 01:09:34,350
want to I want to give I want to give

01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:36,990
money to every every every month give

01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:39,300
that amount of money and a very

01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:44,700
interesting thing is that sits them

01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:47,820
about pledge and and then you can say

01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:50,310
okay let's encrypt is not there but I

01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,950
pledge to the people who preside the

01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:54,720
account let's encrypt on Twitter if they

01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:58,140
join the platform it will automate it

01:09:54,720 --> 01:10:02,100
will activate the 42 pledges of these

01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:05,520
people so that's also way to having to

01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:10,170
an incentive for for people to donate

01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:13,340
and that would be a way to either Debian

01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:18,840
yes there is Debian the get of account

01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:24,080
another platform is open collectives

01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,080
that we are that we have seen with

01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:32,159
we've thank well the good thing is that

01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:34,199
you can also submit invoices so there is

01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:38,010
a lot there is a system of transparency

01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:40,139
where you can you submit invoices they

01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:42,389
are published you see who gets the money

01:10:40,139 --> 01:10:50,789
forward so to building trust again this

01:10:42,389 --> 01:10:53,099
is important and bounties of salt is la

01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:55,829
is likely it's similar to Liberata

01:10:53,099 --> 01:10:58,920
Liberata and bounties on salt and open

01:10:55,829 --> 01:11:04,309
collective are Libre even on the server

01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:04,309
side what else

01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:09,270
wire transfers we don't think about that

01:11:07,469 --> 01:11:11,579
but actually where transfers there is no

01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:14,099
fee so if you don't like Visa MasterCard

01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:17,670
and PayPal you can you can avoid this

01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:19,800
payment processors by if you are in the

01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:22,199
same country or in example in the

01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,329
European Union you can do without fees

01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:27,809
give some money to project if they

01:11:24,329 --> 01:11:29,760
publish their bank account details you

01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:34,800
can set up a monthly or yearly donation

01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,849
and it will work so that's another

01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,389
option

01:11:35,849 --> 01:11:42,539
last up a last option is patron which is

01:11:39,389 --> 01:11:47,340
quite popular even a bit amount Libre

01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:50,760
software and about so what do we start

01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:53,150
to find our favorites positing gives

01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:57,690
them that there is on this wonderful

01:11:53,150 --> 01:12:03,360
proprietary Forge a project which is a

01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:07,230
directory about about recurring

01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:10,079
fundraisings and on various platforms

01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:16,710
there is not only patreon and this is

01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:19,050
there you can go and and give this is

01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:21,210
how you can first see which project can

01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:23,940
interest me so in the futures not risk

01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:28,139
and that co-op hopefully will manage to

01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:31,139
learn have a very interesting model the

01:12:28,139 --> 01:12:33,269
mechanic is very interesting and I

01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:37,289
recommend you to read the website and

01:12:33,269 --> 01:12:37,920
the wiki is a goldmine about all the

01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:40,910
crowdfunding

01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:44,190
in general so the philosophy is awesome

01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:46,890
yeah I show this so conclusion so

01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:49,410
finance and pay you free software even

01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:52,469
if your global budget is one euro by

01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:55,350
month everyone should at least find one

01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:56,699
your opponent to pay for the Libre

01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:59,580
software whether it's a big project

01:12:56,699 --> 01:13:02,699
versus small project if everyone donates

01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:05,969
many project will get funding we we

01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:08,640
don't have yet to issue that only few

01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:12,300
project of money don't worry about there

01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:15,500
just donate what you like so thanks a

01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:19,080
lot that was a presentation on with

01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:22,199
friends Eden and Emmanuel River and we

01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:25,199
made a website by a Tony Hsieh liver dot

01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:28,500
EU where we put the slide and resources

01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:33,920
about that so thanks

01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,920
[Applause]

01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:54,780
No okay so less lightning talk if we

01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:55,440
succeed to make it work in now okay no

01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:58,010
time

01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:03,120
we are sorry the video team has to pack

01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:05,400
so sorry Silva thank you everyone and

01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:10,670
thank you to the video team and sorry

01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,670
