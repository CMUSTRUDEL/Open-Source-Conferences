There are many different ways to contribute to Debian, apart of packaging software and maintaining it.
I will explain the idea behind the Welcome Team in Debian and some contribution opportunities that don't need packaging skills.

	00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:11,690
so welcome Laura Arianna Reyna you will

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,720
be talking about welcome team and how to

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:20,240
contribute without packaging in debian

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,780
hello thank you all for coming

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,540
this talk is like two talks I mean the

00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:31,369
topics are related but I will talk about

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:37,550
the Welcome team the Debian welcome team

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:40,130
was like an idea that came up in 2015

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:45,980
maybe made before but I learned about it

00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:48,140
that in that time the idea was to to get

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,470
people from that are occasional

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,350
contributors to regular to become

00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:58,370
regular members of the any team in

00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,000
Debian and also to help newcomers to

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:06,409
start contributing to that in the

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,329
typical situation of I want to help

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,700
Debian I want to give back something to

00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:16,939
the community but I don't know well what

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:22,639
to do and some team some Debian teams

00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:24,889
have some mentoring initiatives but we

00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:27,609
also thought that maybe we'll we need

00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:30,889
some effort that is more global

00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,590
some people guiding that knows many

00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:36,950
teams in Debian and try to find the best

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,590
place for each one depending on their

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:45,200
skills or the time or what they like

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,479
whatever and also to share among the

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,169
teams the different things the tricks

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,950
the houses about mentoring and are about

00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:58,130
encouraging people to join Debian so we

00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:02,989
are not each team thinking and

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:06,289
reinventing the width so the history

00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:11,410
that I know it's probably all the run

00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:16,790
that but I know this idea from 2015

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:19,819
there was a both in that cone 15

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,390
and the idea was brought up by Ashish

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:26,239
Lorena and Enrico Sydney I joined

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:29,900
remotely and I try to figure out and

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,239
create we were thinking about creating a

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,670
wiki page and we thought and we found

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,329
out that it was a an old wiki page

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,360
called

00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:42,170
wiki Debian or slash welcome

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,900
there was also an old RSC channel Debian

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,629
welcome and we decide to give it new

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,510
life and then when we start to work we

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,069
found out that it was that old effort

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,260
was not really dead

00:02:52,069 --> 00:03:00,650
there were people there in the channel

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:05,060
and people did in the wiki page but they

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:08,659
were focused mostly in new Debian users

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,420
and we wanted to have a place for new

00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,389
Debian contributors so we talked with

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,609
each other and we decided to share the

00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:19,250
infrastructure their pages the wiki page

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:24,349
and the Debian channel and because some

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:26,449
people come and they can just begin to

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,530
contribute the same at the same time

00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:36,310
that they become users too so we decided

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:39,199
like that and the resources that we have

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,879
the pages that you can visit and I will

00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:48,530
show later is wiki Debian or welcome

00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:52,099
slash users that I'm not in that sub

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:56,540
team and wiki they are not / welcome /

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:59,419
contributors that you can find the name

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:04,910
the names of the people that are wanting

00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:09,120
to to help this effort and for now

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:15,420
it's mostly me and now john phillips

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:20,340
is around the IRC channel everybody is

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:25,560
welcome to join the welcome channel we

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:29,760
are like 15-20 people there just lurking

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,200
and people come and ask things and we

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,900
guide them depending we ask back what

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,740
are your skills so what do you want to

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,710
do or people that for example want to

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:47,490
are interested in the artwork and they

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,910
don't know where the things that care

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,600
about that whatever we have no mailing

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,820
list i don't know if it this is good or

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,990
bad if we have time we can talk about

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,930
this later because i feel that some

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,080
people are really shy to post anything

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:13,710
in public and the mailing list has

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:17,880
arrived so it can be intimidating and I

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:22,020
feel that the RSC channel is more fresh

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,960
and more easy but on the other side new

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,160
people not many new people no one use

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,250
IRC so well something to think about it

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,770
and I say no dedicated members because I

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,850
see all day and all the people that we

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:43,290
are hanging on the channel most of us

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:49,160
have are members of some other teams and

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:52,590
are quite busy so there is nobody

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,130
particularly dedicated to welcome people

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:59,100
in Debian except in all the teams that I

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:05,790
will explain now but not in the Welcome

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:11,670
team so it's a little bit weak the team

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:14,460
we need more human resources and there

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,729
is some overlap with other Debian teams

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:21,569
for example they outreach team

00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:24,720
but usually they are focused more in

00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:28,069
more regular programs like Google Summer

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,270
of Code or out which II with a certain

00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:36,500
calendar and certain specific people and

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:40,680
it's the Welcome team is more like

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,590
informal there are some mentoring

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,060
efforts around Debian woman Debian

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,240
diversity not only mentoring but also

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,280
mmm

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:57,419
being nice to new people being welcoming

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,710
in fact in the Debian super user support

00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:04,319
channels usually people ask anything so

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,680
they receive also information about how

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,620
to join the aviÃ³n or how to become join

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,509
a team there is also of course the VR

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,689
mentors for the people interested in

00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:19,139
packaging software there is also a new

00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:22,680
member process for people that decide to

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,289
become an informer members of the area

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,219
and there is the Debian documentation

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:33,659
project I put it there because at the

00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:36,440
end people ask how can I help because

00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:40,110
they all they don't know so maybe

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,589
improving all our documentation or ha or

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:47,300
having a focus in welcoming new

00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:54,680
contributors in all our documentation

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:59,610
maybe could help to some challenge

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,400
challenges that we face we need we need

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,310
a big team a very big team because

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,729
Debian is very diverse and very spread

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,949
it's not that we have like 10 teams in

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:14,460
Debian we have I don't I didn't count

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:17,009
but probably we have minimum 30 14

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,930
different teams there are many many many

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,169
different areas and nobody can know

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,839
everything so everybody is welcome to

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:29,099
help the Welcome team because probably

00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:32,010
you know some parts and in that in those

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:36,919
parts you can give advice

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:39,290
or give the hand to the new comer to

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,990
make the first contributors

00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:45,810
contributions together or whatever but

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:50,280
we there are the things that I show in

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:55,080
in this slide also need many members too

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:58,880
because the tasks are very big so if we

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,950
after my talk you think that it's not

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,260
interesting effort the Welcome team but

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,450
the but some of the others are

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:12,660
interesting for you please join the

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:15,660
others okay and I say that the noumic

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:20,610
Debian developers are the best members

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:23,640
for the Welcome team because when you

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:28,320
are new to Debian but you already passed

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:33,690
the new member process you know how

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:36,780
Debian works but you also remember your

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,960
old times when you were a newcomer when

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,050
you say some news in Debian and you

00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:46,560
become to know many people and attend

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,900
some Debian and some become comfortable

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,220
with the infrastructure and with where

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:59,130
is where are things and so on then you

00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:03,750
become to begin to forget all the the

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:08,640
new the feelings and the strange things

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:12,150
that people that is not in Debian find

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:18,750
when they come to live in so if you are

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:21,510
a new DD also because when you are new

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,720
DD maybe you have your main interesting

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:28,080
Debian and not not much more things so

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,100
this is the time to choose to mentor

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:38,100
somebody before that we catch you for

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:43,110
other things and on the other side I

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:46,140
would like that I would like to propose

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,500
that we think that the whole Debian

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,230
community should be focused in welcoming

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,290
people not I mean having a dedicated

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:59,430
team is not something for the other

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:03,900
teams to say oh this new person and I

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,880
can leave I can send him to somebody and

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,950
I don't need to be welcoming because

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:13,620
there is a welcome team to care about

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:18,210
that no I mean my proposal is that is

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:21,510
the other way mostly this person comes

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,970
to Debian and I know that in that team

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,190
and that in that in that in everything

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,730
that there are there is somebody or

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:32,640
there are some people that are

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:35,100
especially focused in welcoming so from

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,510
the Welcome team we send the new come

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:43,280
through these other teams and I would

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:46,260
like to send people to any team in

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,230
Debian not to a particular team because

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:54,300
I know that this person welcome in there

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,330
and not in other teams well you get the

00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:02,700
idea

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:07,050
so thinking about myself and the things

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:09,360
where I participate and maybe these are

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:13,230
some things that came to mind that I

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,120
propose you the everybody in Debian to

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:20,280
think about the teams where they are

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:24,660
participating to know or to maybe guess

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:29,130
if our team is welcoming or not how can

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:32,100
we improve so usually in one team we

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:34,380
have different levels of commitment we

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,240
have occasional contributors we have

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,690
regular contributors we have core

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,900
members and we have retired members we

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,140
can if you are in the teams in some

00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,920
years you can look to the past and see

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,459
the movements of people people come in

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,160
and going jumping from

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:58,209
one group soup group from one to another

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,480
for example how many people retired how

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:04,540
many new people came if somebody stayed

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,999
in ocassional contributors for too long

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,550
and didn't come and didn't become

00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:12,339
regular contributor maybe something is

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:15,279
wrong there or if somebody is a regular

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:18,819
contributor for a long time and it's not

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,069
never was a core member maybe it's

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:24,519
something is wrong I mean it's pathetic

00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:27,939
it's perfectly fine if it is that that

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,610
is the decision of the person but maybe

00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:33,730
we can think about the team if we are

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,740
facilitating this kind of movements or

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,610
people that don't retire because they

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:44,290
don't find other person to do the work

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:47,110
in the place things like that and also

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:51,610
we can look our team membership and look

00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:54,629
our diversity if we are everybody too

00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:00,790
old if we have people from different

00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:04,749
places cultures skills if there are

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:07,689
tasks that nobody picks up never things

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:13,360
like that also we can look at our

00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:16,509
communication channels if people ask mmm

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,360
shows up wanted to help how the team

00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:27,429
answered that kind of questions or

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:30,490
proposals and and also the team

00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:35,290
infrastructure if the tools that we use

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:39,160
are well documented documented or if we

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:47,319
if our work is known in Debian and

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:52,360
outside the Debian if we have some event

00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:56,249
or blog or place where we put news about

00:14:52,360 --> 00:15:01,240
our team at what do we do if we don't

00:14:56,249 --> 00:15:03,129
show our work new people is very hard

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,050
that they come to join because they

00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:09,410
don't know

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:13,679
that we exist and maybe if these

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:16,860
questions resonate in you or some of you

00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:21,119
maybe you can call for a team meeting

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:26,360
and discuss about this and maybe some

00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:31,019
tasks show up to to make your team more

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:34,470
welcoming but in any case the important

00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:39,449
thing is to find specific things to

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:42,989
improve and to be realistic and to I

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:45,540
mean everybody we have ideas and talking

00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:48,899
is very easy how we should do this which

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:53,389
you do that but we also need to find the

00:15:48,899 --> 00:16:00,239
time and the motivation to actually do

00:15:53,389 --> 00:16:05,489
and finally I invite all of you and all

00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:08,699
of your teams to share your work join

00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:12,869
the Debian welcome channel the Debian

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:15,779
outreach to and also use the Debian

00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:19,799
publicity channels to make your Debian

00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:24,119
work or team more known not only inside

00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:29,730
the AVN but also in the wider audience

00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:32,189
and that's all for the Welcome team if

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,639
you have questions or comments we can

00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:42,569
talk later and in the IRC Channel I'm

00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:47,040
always there so you can find me I I

00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:48,720
wanted also to to show some specific

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,139
contribution opportunities there are

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,629
really many many things that anybody can

00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,649
do in Debian but I wanted to show some

00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:01,619
two or three things that don't require

00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:03,869
coding skills or packaging and it are

00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:06,689
more or less easy so if you know

00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:09,029
somebody that says I want to help Devin

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:13,169
but I don't know what to do and if she

00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:16,020
or he is really open to do anything you

00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,120
and you don't know what to say you can

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:23,160
say go to this

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:25,949
the video and watch the video and do

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,569
that and this is just stopping and later

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:29,809
they can if they don't like they can

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:35,250
change him and probably they will also

00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:43,110
know more specific things that they like

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:47,300
or they don't like in Debian yes this I

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:52,530
already said many corners to start

00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:58,800
sometimes is not easy to do alone to

00:17:52,530 --> 00:18:03,540
start alone and the other of the other

00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:06,750
possibility is to ask the people who are

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:10,320
you what are your skills what is your

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:15,350
time but I find that some this sometimes

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:18,570
can be intimidating because if you say

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:22,440
to somebody that you don't know how much

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:25,679
time can you put in a week for Debian

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,559
it's like a very strong question in my

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,160
opinion so it's a difficult thing so

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:37,580
okay I will just explain spine cleaning

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:41,940
it's a very very easy task it has

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:44,580
secondary collateral effects that it

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,730
makes you read about Debian because you

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,520
review some mailing lists and you see

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,190
the topics even the subjects of the

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,559
mails trying trying to find the spam you

00:18:53,190 --> 00:19:00,120
see some things that happen in that team

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:03,600
and you say you end learning reading

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,610
about Debian it's a very invisible but

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,190
very appreciated I mean when somebody

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,260
goes to the mailing list archives and

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:15,450
find the list full of spam it's very

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,000
difficult to find the correct the mail

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:23,040
that you are looking for but if it's

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,920
clean it's very nice so and you probably

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,470
are the person that asked or you are

00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,230
probably already subscribe to some

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:36,029
Debian mailing list so you can tinder

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:38,760
to list and maybe choose another one to

00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:41,220
learn another topic another Debian topic

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,600
and subscribe there no in fact you don't

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:51,330
need to subscribe you just read the web

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:54,450
archives it's in two steps mark the spam

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:57,269
and the second step is the step is

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,639
actually clean the spam for the second

00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:08,610
step you need to be a Debian developer

00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:12,299
but if the person Martina spam is insist

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,330
can convince somebody to to do the

00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:20,580
second part

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:23,880
so you just review the mailing list

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,850
archives I will show you later you when

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:31,080
you review them the archive in the web

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:33,929
the every message has a button like

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,049
Marcos as a spam so it's just pressing

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:39,480
the button when you find the spam and

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:41,970
then editing a wiki page to reflect that

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,330
you will review that month of that list

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:57,269
so people knows that this that work is

00:20:45,330 --> 00:21:03,299
done but now I will make an example so

00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:06,570
for example here there is the list some

00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:11,460
lists that are doing the spank leaning

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:14,580
no and then for example you will do with

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:18,120
if you decide to clean Deb young woman

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:24,450
so you go to list

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:28,289
Darrien Darrien woman and then see the

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,990
months that you want to clean and here

00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:36,179
there is no spawn so you see the other

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:40,289
there is no spam no spam this is clean

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:42,559
already I think I will choose another

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,559
one

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,110
for example

00:21:50,720 --> 00:22:05,690
and what I'm very unlucky which one like

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:15,140
this

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:21,010
no no why I don't use them my lists my

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:27,410
teens but I know that they have here

00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:29,330
okay this is a spam I don't understand

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:35,380
the language but this is fun so you

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:39,470
press there and this is fun yeah and

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:43,310
that's all I mean for the first you just

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:53,420
go through the whole month marking maybe

00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:55,610
this one yes like this and what I will

00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:02,230
not review the hormones but you see it's

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:05,510
very easy okay and then you go to the

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:11,240
corresponding team that we have been

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:15,590
here in webmaster and then you edit the

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,860
page marking that you review the amounts

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:23,770
the corresponding months you edit this

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:26,870
page you do need a we keep account okay

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:29,420
but if anybody has trouble it has

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:31,550
troubles with these things of having a

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,550
quickie account bla bla bla bla you can

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:37,100
send them to the Welcome team I receipt

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,250
channel and we can write and then you

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:44,180
read it and you put your name or to

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:50,450
reflect that you reviewed that month

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:53,750
okay and when we have five reviews we

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:58,420
decide it I mean automatically the

00:23:53,750 --> 00:24:02,780
system mark actually a spam that message

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:07,040
you know we are quite conservative and

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:11,180
and then if you are a DD it will appear

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,980
to actually remove the male from the

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:19,190
earth life okay this is looks like

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:22,940
strong but well we care about our

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:26,510
archives and we somebody could also

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,910
vandalize with the spam spam spam with

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:34,600
the mail messages that they don't want

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:36,130
that they are stored so so it's a bit

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,340
[Music]

00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:47,150
well maybe boring or tedious but if

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,760
anybody begins with this and they

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,860
discover that it's too much no problem

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,020
they already have a weekly account in

00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:59,030
the VM now you can switch them to

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:06,380
translations in the wiki edit wiki pages

00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:09,920
or whatever okay and if you are a DD you

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:15,860
can help cleaning the sponge so you go

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,980
to the corresponding URL if you have no

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,660
password you request a password and then

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:27,290
you review the Mail's confirming or

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:30,440
saying that is ham not spam and then the

00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:37,480
that mounts will become clean for the

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:41,870
next people reviewing they archive I

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,150
think I will I will skip to another task

00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:48,860
another task for example testing the

00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:53,060
Debian images we produce installer

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:56,030
images live images now also cloud images

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:59,000
when there is a release point or when we

00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:02,030
are going to release these images are

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,300
prepared before then publishing and we

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:08,660
leave some time for people to test that

00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:11,000
actually the Installer works and in you

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,460
know we have many architectures and many

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,770
different desktops and many different

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,690
hardware

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:21,340
systems some people wanted the system

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:25,110
encrypted some of the people wanted we

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:28,150
were using the the accessibility options

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,370
so there is a lot of things to test and

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:34,780
the best thing is to have a very big

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:38,110
team that HP each person tests different

00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:43,150
things so in few time you have many

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:46,840
different tests run and you can join is

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:50,490
just about downloading the image and try

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:55,630
to install or try to run the images okay

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:59,140
so this is the corresponding URL where

00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:04,330
they explained that CD team and lift him

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:06,790
explain how to do what to do you can

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,450
also join the corresponding iris

00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:14,320
channels to ask and also you can keep an

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,960
eye in release mailing list or in the

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,480
publicity team mainly needs to know the

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:25,480
weekend that we are going to release

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:28,570
some something so you can put in your

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,240
calendar Saturday evening I'm going to

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:37,120
test the beyond I don't have better

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:40,840
thing to do and it's it's fun Alena can

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,540
I think can tell - I

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,900
I cannot test usually but I am hanging

00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:48,820
around in the channel and it's it's

00:27:46,900 --> 00:28:00,150
really fun and they are very very nice

00:27:48,820 --> 00:28:03,280
people so why not actually the team

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:06,700
prepares a page where explaining what to

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:10,600
do and for each release prepares a

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,000
matrix of the different tests so you can

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,450
just try to run the Debian isolating

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,320
specific architectures or with specific

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:23,520
desktop or accessibility options or

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,740
whatever if you have particular hardware

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,860
the better here you can what

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:34,850
can download from and then there is the

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:37,730
big matrix tick test matrix where people

00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:42,230
claim the tests then download and they

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:44,900
say the what things specific things they

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:48,350
test it and which are in which hardware

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:51,890
which desktop and if it is runs or not

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:55,010
in if it passed the test or not this is

00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,860
done usually for each release point but

00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:00,530
you can do it at any time with the

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,110
Debian installer with the new release of

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:05,600
the Debian installer and with the leaf

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:09,200
images the live images particularly are

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,880
not very tested because we don't have

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:18,290
many many people so if you want to have

00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:22,130
an interesting weekend you can just join

00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:25,010
and if you have a spare machine a laptop

00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:33,020
no laptop or whatever you can just try

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:37,580
ok let's come to let's switch to the

00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:41,809
next one and well at some time we will

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:46,280
release Debian 10 so we will need many

00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:50,330
many many tests so put in your calendar

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:53,030
some weekend or some some week in the

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,850
next week's months we don't know but

00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:01,690
probably before the end of it for sure

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:10,970
and probably before the autumn for sure

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:15,230
we will need your head old pardon about

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:18,290
user support this is not about joining

00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:21,860
the user support channels this is if you

00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:24,590
are already there giving you support

00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:28,340
channels we would like you to give

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:31,040
feedback to the other Debian teams to

00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,950
Debian welcome to the publicity team

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,260
because it seems like maybe I am wrong

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,250
but for me I feel like there are two

00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:44,049
words and

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:48,669
the you support is so energy consuming

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:52,150
tasks that people just decide if I will

00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:54,070
do you support I barely have time or

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,840
energy or motivation to do all the

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,700
things in Debian and there are people

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,909
that are you know the teams in Debian

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:04,570
just don't have the energy to add user

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:10,600
support well I know people that are

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:15,960
involved but it is difficult so if you

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:19,600
just pick an I just put a nine in your

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,169
language used to support channel maybe

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,510
it's fine that you give some feedback to

00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:28,390
the other teams they outreach the

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:32,740
welcome the publicity the documentation

00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:36,600
from time to time to to know if we

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:39,970
should do anything better or and also

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,190
you can consider to focus in a soup

00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:46,240
group for example join the Debian

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:51,510
accessibility mailing list or Debian

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:55,150
desktop and then you just look there and

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:58,179
join me engage when you have time or

00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:03,940
when something pops up that you know I

00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:06,730
mean it's not like I join I join our

00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:13,150
mailing list and I become core member

00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:21,429
from the day one at all and of course

00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:26,260
again the the publicity team we welcome

00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:28,809
help in all our channels if you don't

00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,530
know any of our channels just ask or

00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,530
just fine

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:41,830
also we welcome people creating content

00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:45,039
we usually publish micro news them the

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,360
thing that we publish more often is

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,800
micro news

00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:54,940
that is a sentence and a link

00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,280
and transforming that in a paragraph for

00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,700
the Debian project news or a blog post

00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:04,260
explaining a little bit more or adding a

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:08,170
photo or whatever it's very welcome okay

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:11,500
so if you don't I don't know what how to

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:14,650
create content for the publicity team

00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:19,080
just go to the micro newsfeed and if

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:22,540
some news already interests you you can

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,960
just summarize it for the next Debian

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:29,470
project news or give it another focus in

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:34,360
a blog post or whatever we also welcome

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:37,180
proofread and translations and also

00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:42,220
they're people that the English is not

00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:45,550
their mother language really mmm it's

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:48,760
not so important we have native speakers

00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:52,960
reviewing our content so it's better

00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:56,410
that you send anything or commit

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,490
anything and then we review quickly all

00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:04,510
together and we get the get it in shape

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:07,120
it's true I'm I mean it's no excuse that

00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:12,550
English is not my mother language to

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:16,000
contribute to the Debian Felicity we I

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:19,480
was making to the publicity team there

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,590
the questions that I show in the Welcome

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:28,870
team part and I realized that we need

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:32,890
people moving from the roles we will

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:38,140
have many people occasional contributors

00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:41,790
but we need them to to get more involved

00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:46,060
okay so if you were thinking about it

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:49,090
you are welcome just do it okay and I

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:55,110
think that's all I left five minutes for

00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:55,110
comments okay thank you

00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:03,929
[Applause]

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:19,829
hi can you hear me yes okay buzz as a

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:23,079
mix between helping new users and new

00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:25,930
contributors with the past years

00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,270
experience what was the feedback about

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:31,569
did it work well did you manage to

00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:34,809
mutual eyes staff or was it was weathers

00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:37,569
was a confusion so redundancy another

00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:43,240
question our slides available somewhere

00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:45,160
and last questions last question you

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,970
talked about something related to

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,500
tasting I saw that every Saturday

00:35:48,970 --> 00:36:02,740
evening or this evening

00:35:50,500 --> 00:36:05,290
something will happen we didn't have

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:10,030
feedback we don't have feedback about

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:14,470
the the not much feedback about the what

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:19,000
the things that work in the past not it

00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:24,579
was just like that we wanted to use the

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,119
welcome word and after we revived the

00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:32,380
channel and we edit that wiki page we

00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:37,240
found out that there were people saying

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:40,869
that hey why are you using our wiki page

00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,190
for a different thing and then we had to

00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:45,970
talk to each other of course and

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:49,569
everything was friendly and we just

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:54,609
decided that both teams are somehow

00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:57,609
related and we couldn't choose which one

00:36:54,609 --> 00:37:00,670
keeps the word welcome because it's

00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:02,410
silly that the one keeps it and the

00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:05,440
other one changed I would try to find

00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,230
another thing so we decided to share the

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,780
infrastructure but that's all the second

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,760
question can you are your actual slides

00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,450
full of link and interesting resources

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,270
available somewhere yes in the slides

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:22,520
there are some

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:26,930
link's and i will the slides will be

00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:29,820
uploaded to the wiki page to the welcome

00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:33,690
contributors wiki page so if you keep

00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,410
the last URL in your mind or only

00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:40,350
welcome that's enough I will do it

00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:42,930
sometime during the weekend yes we

00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:45,090
encourage all speakers to share their

00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:48,330
links to their slides on the wiki page

00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:50,880
is probably the best place yes I mean

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,520
not only the wiki page of the conference

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,290
the wiki page of the Welcome team also

00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:01,770
will include this talk there was a

00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:05,310
question about just testing images yes

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:10,640
no no I mean we don't know when are we

00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:16,020
going to release Debian 10 or Debian

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:21,720
9.10 or whatever but not usually we know

00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:24,480
with some days in advance so if you keep

00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,140
an eye on the Debian publicity team

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,350
their channels or the Debian release

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:35,520
channels you will know at least with one

00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:39,210
week or ten days before - when is

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:44,609
release weekend so you can join that

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:47,960
weekend in life in the LC with the city

00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:51,510
team the lifting and test the images

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,630
right before they are published so you

00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:58,320
become like a privileged person to know

00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:07,340
if the image works or not before the

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:09,720
other person knows that was the idea and

00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:13,830
it's not really a question it's more

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:16,109
like suggestion so we have this

00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,369
association organization in France which

00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:21,480
is called Pharma soft

00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:22,020
who did this big project of Google

00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,770
defying

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,510
the world

00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:29,059
more or less it succeeded in on Google

00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:31,450
if eyeing friends more or less so we

00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:35,030
used to do this workshops where we

00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:39,859
welcomed people from which were not a

00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:42,260
computer scientist and ungoogleable and

00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:46,579
we still do that and now their next

00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:48,799
project is the contribution workshops

00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:51,410
project so what they do is that they do

00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:53,480
workshops where people from that are not

00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:57,950
computer scientists come and contribute

00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,980
to to free software so what they do for

00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:04,039
this is that they pick projects that

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,510
have clear things simple things to do so

00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,970
for example you could do a page where

00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,130
you say if you have five minutes you

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,559
could do and then you do this Pam data

00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,900
tell your list of things if you have 30

00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,089
minutes you do Tata and this could

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:20,049
really help us as a free software

00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:24,619
activist I could do this workshops and

00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:26,900
take these websites and then follow the

00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,940
steps and make people contribute to

00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,180
Debian in like five minutes thirty

00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,760
minutes one hour one week so maybe you

00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,970
could do a both about this tomorrow no

00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,420
tomorrow unfortunately I cannot do it

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:45,170
yes this is this this also needs to be

00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:48,470
done some team wiki pages have such kind

00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:53,930
of lists of easy tasks or quick tasks

00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:57,200
and then more difficult tasks but maybe

00:40:53,930 --> 00:41:01,339
they are old and they need to be updated

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:04,099
a little bit this is a very interesting

00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:06,980
idea and of course welcoming buffs

00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:09,770
in that confide think it is done at

00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:13,130
least some years and in many that comes

00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:14,539
or linden debian user groups it will be

00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:20,500
really nice yes

00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:20,500
it just needs the human resource effort

00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:34,179
so I think it's that's

00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:34,179
