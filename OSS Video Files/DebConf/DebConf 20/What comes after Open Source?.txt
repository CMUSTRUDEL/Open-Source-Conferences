You're going to think I am nuts for saying this.

I think I have worked out what comes after Open Source.

It preserves the goals of Free Software and Open Source, preserves the reasons we succeeded, and deals with the ways in which we've failed. Which are:

We wanted to give people freedom, but we never won the hearts and minds of the common people, they still use proprietary software.

We created our own extractive industries, and both income and control went to those who exploited the developer, rather than the developers themselves.

We were never able to deal with the problem of software patents effectively.
We have no good troll defense. OIN is at least as much for protecting the software patent system from Open-Source-driven reform as it is for protecting us from software patents.

We created a tower of babel of licenses. We did not design-in license compliance, and we have a tremendous noncompliance problem that isn't getting better. We can't afford to sue our copyright infringers.

We did not design a good framework for where proprietary software can go, and where it never should. Our license loopholes are exploited.

I think I have worked out the next step after Open Source, which addresses these things while preserving the good of Open Source and furthering the original goals of Free Software.

Listen, and see if you agree.

hello

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,719
this is bruce parents from berkeley

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,320
california

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,920
and i'm talking about what comes after

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,520
open source so this is a short version

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,240
of the talk your questions

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
may be answered by the full version it's

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
60 minutes long

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,760
and you can find it at parens.com

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,079
there's a lot that's not decided yet

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
maybe you can help with that the

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,559
successor to open source that i'm

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,879
thinking about will exist in parallel

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,160
with open source and free software

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,719
it doesn't meet the definition of open

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
source

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,320
or free software and should never be

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
called

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,760
either one it attempts to achieve some

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,840
goals that open source and free software

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,399
has failed at

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,800
so the initial announcement of gnu was

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,000
37 years ago the two

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,200
freedoms were announced in 1986

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,560
the debian developers created the debian

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,280
free software guidelines

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,040
23 years ago so it's time

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,119
to evaluate our mission achievement

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
the good news is open source is

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,840
everywhere obviously

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
there's an astonishingly large body of

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,119
it

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,600
lots of people get paid to produce it

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
and

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,600
open source has replaced the consortium

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,000
as a means of corporate cooperation the

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,560
bad news goes on for a while

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
but the summary is there are a lot of

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,479
ways

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
in which open source is broken and we've

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,920
really

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
only rationalized about them for a long

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,560
time

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,560
fixing open source is not the solution

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,240
you can't solve the problems

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,680
without creating a paradigm that works

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,320
fundamentally differently from open

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,799
source

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,680
and free software the impedance mismatch

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,640
with business actually drives open

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,959
source

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
it primarily follows the goals of

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
business

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,920
because of the power differential

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,840
they have all the money the result is

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,959
that open source satisfies

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,319
business very well but fails to achieve

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
its other goals all of the good of open

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,280
source

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,840
has never reached the general population

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,959
and today they need it more than

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,680
ever do we really help them well they

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,680
widely

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
use open source but the general

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
population mostly doesn't

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,879
know it and it's often used in service

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
of their exploitation

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,920
through devices and services that have

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,959
the business function of

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,680
collecting espionage about the user or

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,319
even manipulating them

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,720
it's not the general population's fault

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,040
for not using open source

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,959
yes our software would be more

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,120
respectful of their rights

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,519
but it's not their fault for not

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,519
choosing us it's our fault

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:21,200
for not serving their needs

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,599
open source has a begging problem

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,840
the developers write the software that

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,280
keeps the entire technical world

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,319
running for this anyone else

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
would be highly compensated but the open

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,720
source developers are

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
supplicants they have to bag so this is

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,159
begging

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,159
please give me a job in your exploitive

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,000
company so that i can be paid for

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,360
writing open source

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,680
please sponsor me on patreon hear that

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,879
one a lot don't you

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,319
we're represented by powerful companies

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,439
not us look at this list a lot of people

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,080
who have

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,200
different interests than the open source

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
developers

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,760
it's like loggers claiming to represent

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,239
the trees

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,000
the qualcomm guy on the list fights the

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,280
open source initiative

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,239
to prevent royalty-free standards at

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
etsy the standards organization that's

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,000
just

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,240
one example of differing interests

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,440
behind the leadership of the linux

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,800
foundation a new problem

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,520
api copyrights the jury in oracle versus

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,560
google

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,840
found for api copyrights no

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,880
case has overturned that yet

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,800
the old guidelines that said apis were

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,960
not copyrightable

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,160
have been replaced in modern court cases

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,120
software patents are still a problem the

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
patent quality

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
improvements that open source one in the

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,320
usa

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,560
in the early 2000s have been reversed so

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
what do we do we have open innovation

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,360
network

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,919
which unfortunately exists as much

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
to protect the software patenting system

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,240
from open source

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,199
driven reform as it does

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,759
to protect linux from software patents

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
so who controls the open innovation

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,400
network

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,199
google ibm nec phillips sony toyota some

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,240
of the biggest

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,280
patent holders in the world soos doesn't

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
even belong

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,080
on the list their interest is in

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,960
protecting the patent system that

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,440
provides them revenue from open source

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,759
driven reform compliance is a mess

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,639
there was no design for licensed

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,600
compliance in the open source paradigm

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,280
as a result it's expensive to carry out

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,960
and dissuades

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,520
business users who would try

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
i've been there i've i've consulted for

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,400
so many of these companies

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,560
and it's big and slow and expensive

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,000
and confusing license violations

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,440
can't be prosecuted if you're going to

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
have a license

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,960
that makes any kind of significant

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,280
requirements

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,240
you need to be able to enforce it that

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,160
means

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,160
sue your infringers otherwise

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,759
you should just put all of your software

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,160
in the public domain

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,479
because that will be the effect anyway

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,360
open source and free software developers

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,840
can't afford to sue

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,039
infringers there are too many licenses

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,319
most of the new ones

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,360
don't add enough value to offset the

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,560
combinatorial cost

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,360
many of them are favorable toward the

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
company

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
where they were written they're not in

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
favor of the open source developer

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
community

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,120
at all and we're going in the wrong

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,120
direction on that

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
current open source initiative board

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,240
policy

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,120
is to become a comprehensive source

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
of open source licenses that means to

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,479
adopt

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:11,680
very many more whose interest is that in

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,080
so let's make something new instead

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
after

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680
37 years it might be possible for us to

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
learn

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,560
from our mistakes hey this is

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,479
really ambitious might not succeed

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,880
but it would be worse if we didn't try

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,680
so let's set some goals the first should

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,199
be

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,000
preserve open source i have an idea for

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
that

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,599
we should commit to grant the open

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
source developers

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,759
all of the advantages of our new

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,400
paradigm as well

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,240
and support them to continue to allow

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,800
their software to be used

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
under an open source license

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,360
preserve open source the most important

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,800
requirement here

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,479
is stability so

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,759
my idea is form a new open source

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,800
promoter it's called coherent open

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,840
source

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,440
the website is licensed use dot org

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,479
it's just in its infancy it preserves

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,560
the open source

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,680
definition in its present form

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,120
it promotes a minimal set of only three

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,000
licenses with important characteristics

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,039
and it doesn't change the only future

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
change will be

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,039
updates of those three licenses so it

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,719
doesn't

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,000
need a committee to govern it

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:44,480
the coherent licenses are all approved

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,200
by both osi and free software foundation

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,279
they're all compatible with each other

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,760
each has a clause regarding software

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,959
patenting each fits a different business

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
purpose

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,040
two of the three ask a little more of

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,760
industry than some

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,360
companies are comfortable with today

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,480
because we should push

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,440
that line so the coherent license set

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,800
is three licenses that have different

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,839
business purposes

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
and you can satisfy most business

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,160
purposes

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:23,040
with these three and they are apache 200

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,880
lgpl3 and a ferro gpl3

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,200
and if you've read them you'll you'll

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,399
notice that

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,600
lgpl3 and afero gpl3

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,959
actually share a lot of text so you

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,160
really only have to learn

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,240
two and a half licenses

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,600
okay so let's get to moving forward

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,240
moving forward we attempt to

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
create a new paradigm because attempts

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
to fix

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,240
open source will only break it

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,320
worse by abandoning its present

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,040
guarantees of freedom

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,839
and non-discrimination and that's

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,880
already in progress

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,079
so one of the goals should be no central

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,480
committee

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,079
the minimum organization necessary to

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,079
produce one license

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,839
and one operating agreement and

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,560
evangelize them

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,880
is all that needs to be formed the

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,279
operating agreement is enforced by

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,279
developers working together

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,440
not any central committee the goal here

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,360
is to minimize self-sustaining

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,920
bureaucracy

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,399
hey look in 30 years of doing this i

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,200
know i don't want to administer or

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,720
operate companies i hate doing that i

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,720
want to develop software

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,120
one of the goals should be freedom of

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
course preserve the freedom to have the

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,160
source code for

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
your software and to use modify and

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,959
redistribute the software for

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,519
any purpose but recognize that the

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,079
freedom of the general population of

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,440
human beings is the freedom that we're

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,720
working for

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
we are not mainly here to give

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,320
corporations more

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,760
freedom differentiate

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,959
freedom and zero cost free as in freedom

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,920
and charging for some

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,920
uses already lived together with dual

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,040
licensing in open source

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,320
companies that don't want to share

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,240
modifications can pay

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,279
let's take that paradigm and expand it

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,760
we will do it all with one

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,160
license fix the impedance mismatch

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,600
between free and business and we do that

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,120
by charging for

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,160
some business use cases

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,279
and in turn we may compliance

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,560
much easier than it is today send

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,279
one payment process or a check once a

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
year

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,360
for all of the post open source software

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,120
in a charged use case

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,920
in your company make determining what

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,760
you pay

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,800
easy if you pay you can combine

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,200
with proprietary software that's

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,480
compliance it's going to be easier

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,680
even cheaper for very many companies

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,519
and most use cases remain

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,600
free pay the developers developers

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,920
should not be supplicants

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,320
and have to beg in order to have the

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,720
right to do their development and

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,279
feed their families they should have a

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,079
means to prosecute infringers

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,880
and the financial means to represent

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,839
themselves

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,480
rather than be represented by industry

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,160
stand-ins

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,279
apportionment gee is that a word you've

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
never heard

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,839
it's taking one payment and splitting

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,240
it up among various payees there needs

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
to be a technical way to figure out how

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,880
to apportion

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,120
income among developers this depends on

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,920
everyone using git correctly so that

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,000
work is attributed

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,000
there are special cases that we have to

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,120
watch out for

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,680
goals serve the general population

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,959
we've in general written software to

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
scratch our own

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,839
itch so we mostly write code for coders

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,720
just like us to use we've not had

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,480
any strong incentive to serve the

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,519
general population

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,920
of differently technical human beings

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,560
around us they're not non-technical some

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,000
of them are genetic engineers

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,120
obviously some projects and developers

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,160
choose to do this anyway

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,800
better incentives might help

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,839
getting paid is a good incentive to

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,079
better meet the needs of the general

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,720
population

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,279
software that some businesses pay for

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,240
will always be available for individuals

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,959
for free

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,639
and most business use cases for free

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,800
developers will still

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,440
write what they want to write but i

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,800
think they'll be better motivated

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,440
reduce complexity one license

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
and one operational agreement among the

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
developers

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,440
users don't have to concern themselves

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:20,079
with the operational agreement

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:23,120
compliance is built into the paradigm

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,519
goal don't read a license if you don't

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,240
have to the vast majority of individual

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,120
users

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
never will the reasons for you to read a

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,360
license are

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,320
you modify or combine the software

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
you sell it you offer software as a

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
service

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,199
you sell devices you offer support

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,160
if you don't do any of those things you

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,040
don't have to read a license

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,079
if you have a no charge use case you

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,519
publish

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,279
all modified source code usually people

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,880
can do this through one of the git

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,440
sites github git lab etc

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,160
we would also have our payment processor

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,760
offered that as a free service

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,720
uh it closes an exploited gpl

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,639
loophole publishing is much better than

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
just giving the source code to people

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,880
that you give the binary

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,959
also convey the license and the

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,560
statement of origin just like we do with

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,199
open source today

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,360
if you want to combine with proprietary

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,160
software and keep the result private

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,519
that is a

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,079
paid use case

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,440
we need to have a patent in api

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,720
copyright free

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,839
zone and we do that by saying

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,399
in our contract that if you bring a

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,040
patent or api copyright suit

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,560
regarding any software under the post

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,880
open source license

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:55,040
all of your licenses terminate

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,639
implementation detail use contract law

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,720
it's got to be a contract users without

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,079
charged use cases

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,360
consent passively users with

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,000
charged business use cases consent

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,920
actively

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
online through one of our payment

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
processors

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,399
so what are the charge use cases

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
inclusion in a product that produces a

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,480
revenue payment

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,320
for its sale or direct use so that's

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,600
embedded devices

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,120
software licensed for income

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,920
software performed as a service that

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,519
produces income for the service itself

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,560
whatever the service is so if you have a

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,759
web server

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,000
use it to sell widgets that doesn't get

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,320
charged if you have a web server that

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,839
performs a service that's paid for

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,959
that does get charged inclusion

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
means all components under the post open

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,240
source

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,680
license that could be libraries your

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,120
operating system

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,480
your database this does not depend on

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,120
linking probably depends on

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,919
the boundary of one physical computer

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,280
but that's

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,240
something we can work on setting

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,039
charged use cases number two support

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,079
vended by

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,640
parties that are not substantially the

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,959
copyright holders of the supported work

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
red hat enterprise linux i'm looking at

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
you

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,120
we can restrict support because our

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,319
agreement

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,640
is a contract and you can't exercise any

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,160
copyright rights at all not even

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,919
reading it without joining it

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,080
specific requirement in this for

00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,160
notification

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,039
of security information to the

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,679
developers on a timely basis

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,080
everyone has to do that that is

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,880
unfortunately a currently exclu

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,600
exploited loophole with red hat

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,559
enterprise linux they have a

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,280
gated community of security information

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,520
if you

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,200
spread that to people who haven't paid

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,720
you lose

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,280
access to it um we don't want that to go

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,600
on any longer

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:14,799
so charge use cases number three

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,080
combination with proprietary software

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,440
whether it's internal or external

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,400
it's given a blanket license for the

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,000
company

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,120
based on its size paid annually

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,880
no other compliance necessary and you

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,520
can subtract

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,280
what you pay for other use cases so if

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,919
you're already paying

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,320
for software as a service you may not

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,840
pay

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,039
anything for this

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,200
there is a dual licensing choice clause

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,240
that is for the benefit of open source

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
developers if

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,919
they do a license with our post open

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,360
source

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,000
license and an open source license

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,360
the licensed choice has to be the post

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,039
open source license

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,039
that gets them paid

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
those are all of the charge use cases

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,160
everything else is no

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,120
charge all individual use cases

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
are free most business use cases are

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,640
free

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,120
if you don't combine with proprietary

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,200
software you don't sell the software

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,679
you don't offer the software as a

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,559
service or support for a fee

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,640
and you don't make embedded devices you

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
will never need to read the license

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,559
you'll never need to pay

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,559
anything

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,720
so should we be ethical there are a

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
number of ethical licenses i created one

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,919
sort of as a

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,160
joke or a test called the vaccine

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,760
license it requires that you get your

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,240
shots

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,280
they're all well intended they make you

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,600
feel good

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,840
but they wouldn't work in a court so

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
sorry

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,799
so how do you comply with the charge use

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,080
case you share a small portion of

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,559
revenue has to be revenue not profit

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,120
because profit is too easy to state

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,120
creatively i worked for movie studios

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,480
they were very good at never making a

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,400
profit

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,039
uh there's a very simple scanning

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
process just to recognize what releases

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,240
of what projects you are using

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,799
and what percentage of the product

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,360
software we make up

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,320
you figure out a percentage you fill in

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,960
a statement

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,039
you send payment to a payment processor

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,080
that handles apportionment among the

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,240
developers

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,960
you do this once a year

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,440
compliance for charge use case is number

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,559
two

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,080
so no requirement to distribute source

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:49,200
code or license text if you pay

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,200
submit to audit if required

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,120
but there are limits meant to protect

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,120
you from abusive behavior

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
so what are the fees and rules not yet

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,840
decided and i'll need your help

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,440
intended to be mostly unchanged after

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,919
creation

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,919
the rules for upgrading the license and

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,400
operating agreement

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,600
not yet intended uh determined but the

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,880
main intent is to avoid bureaucracy

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,120
a paid or non-pay user can stay with an

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,120
old version of the rules and charges

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,559
forever if they stick with the old

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,640
software

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,640
so you will always know what you're

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,960
paying

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,280
the operational agreement establishes

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,919
payment processors their duties and

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,159
income

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,280
provides for apportionment of payment to

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,840
developers

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,640
requires that developers are diligent in

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,039
preserving

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,200
attribution of work that they

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,240
incorporate so that people are paid

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
fairly

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,559
establishes technical standards for

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,600
carrying this out

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,320
enforcement any developer who signs the

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,360
operating agreement can sue on behalf

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,200
of every developer but the agreement

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,320
limits how they sue

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,840
there's a 90-day grace period

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,159
you get trouble damages plus legal fees

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,360
for

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,720
persistent non-payment you can let a

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,240
complaint out to a law firm on

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,600
contingency this works best

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,760
because it's done on behalf of all the

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,200
developers so the fees can be larger

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,679
than otherwise

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,360
it's not intended to be a money maker

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,919
for developers

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,159
it makes the enforcement enough of a

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,760
threat that developers will usually get

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,720
paid

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,960
well anyone go for this i don't know

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,799
it's for the good of developers so i

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,200
think there's a chance

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,360
whether business users come on board

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,919
mostly has to do with the size of the

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,559
community and the quality of the code

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,480
did we really think business would jump

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,880
on open source the way they did

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,440
no so we have the power developers

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,159
have the power simply because of our

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
numbers

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,360
and our productivity we need to harness

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
that power for the good of the general

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,679
population

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,640
and for our own good and this will take

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,679
belief in ourselves to get started

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,919
bravery and tenaciousness to build

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,080
where do i go from here i'm still

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,600
begging i could use sponsorship to

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,640
continue work on this

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,960
and i need legal resources thanks very

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
much

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,440
okay thank you bruce let's go to

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,360
question and answer now

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,360
so i'll read the first question here on

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,360
the we have quite some questions so

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,200
let's try to be uh effective

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,360
so the first question is how would your

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,960
proposition solve the problem of free

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
software being used

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,320
by large enterprises systems designed to

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,120
track and inspire

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,279
people um

00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,480
unfortunately i don't believe that

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:04,880
the so-called ethical licenses

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,159
can be enforced in court um

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,320
so the first answer

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,200
is that i don't believe that

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,400
provisioning your license

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,919
to prevent that kind of use

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:24,320
would work what would work

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,799
would be providing a competing

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,679
product for the user to use and open

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,919
source has

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,279
totally failed that so for far obviously

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,640
people go to the

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,679
apple store for their phones uh

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,679
they use the android uh telephone if

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,279
they're not going to the apple for

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,640
etc we have completely

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,679
fail at providing the user with

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,880
end user solutions that they actually

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,080
want to use

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,120
and so what i'm trying to do here

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,200
is provide the open source developers

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,159
with more motivation

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,360
to make compelling and user software for

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,840
people

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,679
that does not do that kind of spying

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,880
obviously there are a lot of open

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,159
questions

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,159
um whether this will work economically

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,919
all up in there we we won't know until

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,320
we do it

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,520
i'd be happy to discuss this with you

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,000
further if you have any ideas about it

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,159
a lot of getting from here to actually

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,559
having a working program is going to be

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,960
talking with other developers

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
go on

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,240
okay here's a question why why is the

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,480
regular

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
non-affair of gpl in the list of

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,039
licenses

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,760
i'm sorry repeat that why

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,760
is the non-affair gpl in the list of

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,360
licenses

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,760
why isn't the non-faro gpl slide rather

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,600
than the

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:07,120
ferro gpo um well the

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:12,000
idea of coherent open source licensing

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,880
was to have a minimal set of licenses

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,760
um so given the choice of applying the

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,240
gpl

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:23,760
or the afero dpl the afero gpl

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,080
has a provision that allows you to get

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,159
source code if the source code is

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,559
performed

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,360
and that is directed against all of the

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,880
softwares of service companies

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,240
which would perform highly modified

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,679
software and never distribute it so the

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,159
gpl

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,440
as it stands would not get the

00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,679
modifications would not get the source

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,440
code for those modifications

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,080
the afro license would now if you're

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,960
using the afero gpl3

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,000
for something that isn't software as a

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,760
service

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,360
its effect is the same as epl3

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:11,039
so i think it was a win to just choose

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,679
a ferro gpl3 instead of saying well let

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,840
out four

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,880
licenses let's have apache

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,399
lgpl gpl and a ferro gtl there wasn't

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,399
really a reason to have

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,840
both gpl and deferro gtl

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:30,559
okay next one is statically linked

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,960
languages are growing popularity

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,559
is the standard fgpl of the design

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,440
option

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:43,279
or the fgpa with static link inception

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:47,200
well i think that

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,399
the legal issues here have changed

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,240
because of

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:55,440
the acceptance of api copyrights at

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,720
least in the united states so far

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,720
it used to be that

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:06,000
dynamic linking was

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,039
arguably legally different from static

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,840
linking

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,720
i'm not sure it actually ever was we

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,120
didn't have

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,440
really good cases about it the only

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,760
kisses we had were mostly about

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,320
video game cartridges and they're

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,080
plugging into the video game

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,080
um so one of the

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
important changes that i'm making here

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,679
is the post open source license

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,840
does not depend on liking it depends on

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,960
combination because there are things

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,240
like object

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,840
brokers etc that come by software in

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,360
ways that nobody ever

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:48,159
thought of when gpl2 was written

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,159
um so as far as

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:56,520
lgpl 3 and the static linking

00:28:52,559 --> 00:29:00,399
exception it's actually kind of

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,720
antique and one of the things that we're

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,200
doing with coherent open source

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,840
is we're saying okay this is the best we

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,120
can do with open source

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,000
and let's go to a new paradigm where we

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,120
don't have to

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,200
argue about linking anymore uh

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,480
and that's the best answer i've been

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,440
able to come up with so far

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,720
all right next one is a bit long but

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,880
i'll try my best your goal is to be able

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,279
to pay maintainers and developers

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,600
jesus sadly comes at the cost of having

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,279
increased responsibility

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,640
if someone pays for something they

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,840
expect it to work

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,640
to me this takes out the fun of working

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,640
free software

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,320
would post open source only be a

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:51,440
commercial space with no hosts

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:55,520
um well it's still the same

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,720
decline warranties as today

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,840
and the idea there is

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,480
you are using the most

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,039
open source software in your business

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,399
you have made the decisions

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,080
about whether it is fit to use

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:18,000
uh and the open source developer

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,120
is not responsible to come rescue you

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,159
if their software breaks in some way

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,559
that you did not

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,799
expect where we're we're charging a

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,880
relatively small percentage for this

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,679
software we aren't charging for full

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,039
service

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,640
full service is something you can

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,559
offer uh you can offer it for your own

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,600
software you can offer it for

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,679
for all of the post open source software

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,640
if you pay a small percentage of what

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,120
you make from the

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,880
other developers and um

00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:00,000
so if you feel that a

00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,000
funny or useful for you

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,399
there's a lot of enough to do there are

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,279
real

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,000
people who are willing to execute more

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,240
software

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,279
for money next question

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,760
yes what about open ssf

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,080
should we leave linux and migrate to the

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,240
best year or something

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,440
um i don't think that

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:33,840
the operating system will last

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,840
forever um

00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,249
[Music]

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
um

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,599
[Music]

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,279
and that very valuable many pesticides

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,039
yeah i think we have we have some audio

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,559
glitch

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,559
i hope me

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,840
yeah it seems everyone is getting some

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:31,440
gambled audio let's try going on

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,640
okay so next question

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,399
is for known programmers artists etc who

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,640
use creative commons

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:44,720
instead what license would fear model

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:48,880
um i'm not into i'm not attempting

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,480
to solve all the problems in the world

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,399
um so i have

00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,000
not try to solve

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,840
a uh problem for performance

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,279
part for uh literary publications

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,120
etc uh we have seen the open source

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,080
licenses applied to these things

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,320
it's conceivable that um we could see

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,840
the post opens our slice and supply the

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,960
things that

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,840
we don't really expect uh i

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,840
i haven't

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:39,840
i think we lost bruce

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:56,399
me are you there yes he's coming back

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,440
yes yeah i think we lost you for

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,519
you you have to unmute yourself ah

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,080
i think he lost rules he got connected

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,080
from me too

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,240
okay let me try reloading them

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,320
uh i think it's an issue with this

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,760
system maybe

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,760
yeah bruce do you hear me

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,960
yeah um i don't hear you you're muted

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,960
i'm muted

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,159
yeah you're saying

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,639
yeah i lost you only so so i haven't

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,520
really

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,320
thought about works other than software

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,359
works

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,440
at this time uh and

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,000
i'm not sure that's really for me to

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,040
solve um

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,440
literary works uh performance art videos

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,679
conceivably could be put under the post

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,200
open source license but i'm not sure it

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,159
really works for them

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,760
uh i'd be happy to discuss that more

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,720
next question please

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,320
yes uh you say you don't want this new

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,200
organization to become a large

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,400
bureaucracy

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,320
but looking at fbi and conservancy

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,000
accounting has been a very large burden

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,720
and takes a lot of resources

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,280
how would this org not waste tons of

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,359
money

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,160
on accounting in financial services

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,079
especially a scale you're talking about

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,400
okay so uh my idea was to create payment

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,000
processors payment processors

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,680
are for-profit companies there's more

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,640
than one of them

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,880
they receive payments and they

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,079
distribute them to the developers

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,200
the accounting is their use

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,520
they get a percentage of the money that

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,079
they handle to pay for that

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,760
uh and i thought it was important that

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,599
they not be a monopoly

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,079
so i i put in the provision for there to

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,079
be more than one payment processor

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,920
they have to sign the operating

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,960
agreement but they

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,000
can be independent of each other so

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,520
your idea is to provide the definitions

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,640
and the rules and then let

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,560
third party payment processors handle

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,000
the actual business

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:18,079
well i think that uh i would probably

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,760
help some companies start one um

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,240
there's a chicken in that problem

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,839
otherwise you really have come out of

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,960
the gate with a way to get paid

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:31,440
right okay next question

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,040
want these collapse under the detail of

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,400
dealing with both very small

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,200
corporations through

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,320
to the huge ones plus the different ways

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,880
to store source

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,000
not just github and then linking the

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,880
developer ids

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,760
across multiple platforms to their app

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,040
approachment

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,079
yes so um there

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,680
are issues of well you receive

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,720
lots and lots of checks uh each of the

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,560
checks

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,400
says what open i'm sorry what post opens

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,960
horse projects are being used the

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,760
granularity is usually project

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,160
and um so you really have to sum all of

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,720
those

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,760
up and decide how to imp apportion

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,440
payments

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,640
to developers it it doesn't actually

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,880
sound that complicated

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,359
to me it sounds like something you could

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,160
figure out with a spreadsheet or

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,480
you know a software program for that is

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,960
eminently possible

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:40,000
um and point also here is by creating

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,119
uh payment processors uh

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,880
they can compete to give good

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,880
service to um and thus to be recommended

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,720
by the projects as their preferred

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,760
payment processor

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:58,160
although you can use any one

00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,720
they can optimize their own performance

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,839
you get a fixed amount uh whether you

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,920
make the profit

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:09,119
or not depends on how efficiently

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,480
you operate um so

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,760
i'm i'm not considering that this is

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,880
a burden that the payment processor

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,440
could not handle as far as

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:26,800
how you uh account for who wrote what

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,920
it really depends on it um

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,119
i i can't make it

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,720
work for every revision control system

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,599
in the world and that

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,720
potentially presents some projects with

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,359
technical

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,200
problems but remember this is the

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,480
decision that you're making for your

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,680
project just start

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,480
issuing it under this post open source

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,359
license

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
and your vision control system might

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,280
have to change

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,680
when you make that decision if it's not

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,720
get

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,200
at this time um

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,119
there's nothing sinister about this it's

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,480
just that

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:13,119
i know a company that does

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,119
account for developers using git

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,480
they're called merico m-e-r-i-c-o

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,640
uh i have to make a disclaimer i own

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,800
something less than a percent of

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,800
that company through another company

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,720
that makes investments

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,640
uh probably not um

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,800
important because i don't think that

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,839
people want to use commercial software

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,000
to do this i think they want to create

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,440
post opens or software to do this

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,040
particular task

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,040
but that company americo and eri.co gave

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,200
me some of the ideas for

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,599
accounting for developers go on

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
right and how do you see the projects we

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,720
have today

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,520
transitioning into this model like from

00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,280
from

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,720
the small projects small web

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,359
applications or even

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,400
medium to large applications through

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:11,359
this scale of a project like debian

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:15,520
so um existing software

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:20,640
projects with dual license

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:22,560
and that means that

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,079
they would continue to issue their

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,280
software is open source

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,839
they'd also post open source license

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,640
if you combine that with software that's

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,599
only under

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,760
post open source license you have to use

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,400
supposed open source slices on both

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,000
pieces

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,160
so you get paid the issue of debian is

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,119
actually a special one debian would have

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,319
to work through

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,520
a compilation copyright

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,079
and the idea there is that billion does

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,640
not

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,960
necessarily own a copyright to the

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,960
software and its distribution for the

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,200
most part it does not

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,359
but the work that debian has done to

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,200
combine all the software and tool

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,920
working system

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,720
is under a compilation copyright a

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,680
separate copyright from the software

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,400
and that would be a special charge use

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,160
case

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,359
so if you have something like ubuntu

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,599
that was paid for

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,520
i don't actually know what it's paid for

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,280
open to but if you had something that

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,160
was paid for

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,119
um debian would potentially receive

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,119
income from that

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,800
okay so next question you say you don't

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,599
want to support operations

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,520
uh you mean monopolies or large

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,319
profitable ones right

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,200
but i don't see any detail here does not

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,240
favor large

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,480
enterprise it is just an easy throw

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,319
money solution they love

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,839
also technical solutions to legal

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,720
economic always don't work

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,040
a committee-less project means there is

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,520
no

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,359
real life real people democratic or

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,480
other governance structure beyond the

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:06,560
power provided by throwing money

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,839
so um this is actually

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,040
dealing with the problem

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,960
of having two communities uh we have a

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,319
community that wants to share

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,599
software and we have a community

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,560
that really doesn't want to share

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,280
software and what do you do with that

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,480
community well we have tried for

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,079
at least 22 years to sort of force that

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,680
community into sharing

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:39,680
software and it is worked on easily

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:43,200
um i go and consult companies

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,560
all of the time and the reality is that

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:50,960
most companies big or small

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,640
are vastly incorporating open source

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,920
software into the products

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,200
and are not complying with the licenses

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,480
i have had um i've been paid for

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,280
consulting where the

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,640
end decision in the company was well you

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,599
know we should comply

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,920
it's just going to be too expensive so

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,760
we're not going to do this we'll design

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,359
our next product so it doesn't need

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,200
compliance

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:19,760
um it's it's really

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,400
uh discouraging to walk away from a

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,079
company that is decided that open source

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,119
licensed clients just isn't worthwhile

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,960
uh it happens so

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,760
what i'm attempting to do here is um

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,760
make things fit better than they do

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,040
today

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,520
as far as saying technical solutions to

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,480
legal problems don't work you could also

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,960
say that

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,880
legal solutions to technical problems

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,640
don't work both of those statements were

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,400
much too broad

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:57,040
um the open source licenses

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,640
in the open source paradigm has actually

00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,680
been

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,880
a really great legal

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,720
solution to a

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:12,480
legal technical and operational

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,680
problem if you remember

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,400
30 years ago companies used to get

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,280
together

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,839
and have consortia so that they could

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,760
develop

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,000
software together they don't anymore

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,160
they use open source so we have solved

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,760
the sort of problems legally

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,760
i think we're at the end of our time

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,359
okay do you have any more time for

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,720
questions

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,839
director i don't think so right

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,640
i don't know i think yeah so

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,640
thank you bruce i think there's a lot of

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,760
discussion that comes from this

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,920
and i hope you good luck with

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,119
the future of this project thank you

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,119
very much bye-bye

00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,680
