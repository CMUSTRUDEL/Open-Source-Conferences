nice group of seven

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,520
i say it's much grown since the three

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,000
that were around when

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,280
when i joined i said when we spoke about

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,800
the community team

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,600
last year at deb conf we are always

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
looking for

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
more members of the team um we want to

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
try and

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,400
cover as much of the diverse background

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
of of people within debian as we

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,120
possibly can

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,400
we like to have a good range of

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,880
voices and opinions to make sure that we

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,919
actually

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,000
are covering

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,919
all of all of those voices and opinions

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,039
that that might be in debian you know

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,039
we're generally genuinely trying to be

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,280
a good to provide a good cross-section

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
here

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
so i think jean-claude was up next

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
talking about

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
what do you think we do

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,800
yeah sorry

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,000
i need to to speak

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,120
um so in this section uh we wanted to

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
kind of have

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,199
a conversation with people um since

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
there aren't a lot of people in the room

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,680
feel free to just

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:18,319
speak freely um uh

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,360
about what the community

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
thinks the community team does and

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
should be doing

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
there's this idea in design

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,240
where you ask people what a piece of

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,919
technology should do

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,280
uh and that's what it should do and

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,280
that's how you should design it

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,960
um so we'd like to hear a little bit

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
about just like what people think the

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,599
community team should be doing and what

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,840
we are doing

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,840
and how we're doing

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:04,160
okay so i i uh i tried to to start right

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,400
yeah okay uh sorry because my i i'm

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,759
afraid i needn't understand so

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,120
uh well um the

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,720
the thing we can try to to

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,440
to say to to to show how what we do and

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,090
how we

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
we try to do uh is to um

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,240
[Music]

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,160
do a kind of sum up summary about what

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,599
we did during this year

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,599
um this year the team

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,440
had uh well two two kind of activities

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
or three kinds of activity

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,159
uh the first one is of course the team

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,519
building because it was a

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,240
very important year for us uh to

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,640
to to have the the members with us we

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,040
are now

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,040
seven but it wasn't without the efforts

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,000
so we are very happy with the with this

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
new situation uh and this new team

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
because

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,120
most of the previous team uh were

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,920
were some somewhat exhausted or or was

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,399
not here

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,760
fortunately there was some person so

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,800
they helped us to

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,480
to to to build those

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:16,000
rely relying on on the

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,360
hard on hot bases um we

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,519
we had to to to find some

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,279
better tools to to work together

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,839
efficiently in a currently

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,279
collaborative mode but also getting a

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,560
track of the activity

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,760
and also we worked on the delegation

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,279
by the dpl which takes some

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,480
some time of scrolls to define our exact

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,080
responsibilities and our world in the

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,440
in the community about the

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,640
the tasks themselves um i would

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,760
say that there were two kinds of

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,240
activities

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,839
uh the first one is to introduce the

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,640
team we did that

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
during mini laptop and the end of may

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
and

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,160
also uh on external events

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,360
that is guadaq so the globe annual

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,560
meeting

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,600
and also uh we we

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,680
we tried to uh to to address

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,720
uh various requests we we received um

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,279
what i would like to say personally

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
and others will say what say how they

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,640
see this

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:30,240
um is that um the difficult

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,440
part of the community team role is

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,560
that first we only advise so of course

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,519
we have never

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,240
uh the end the power decision that is uh

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,720
expected

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,720
and it's uh it's it's a good thing uh in

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,360
regard of the other teams

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
um and the other thing is that when we

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,120
address a request

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,959
our response needs a lot of care

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,320
not to hurt the reporter or the targets

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,640
in each case we should expect some

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
hard feedback some difficult feedback

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,959
either from the

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,519
reporter or from the targets uh um

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,959
it's something that we need to deal uh

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,440
as a team

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,079
so uh it's very important for us to be a

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,640
team

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,519
uh and it's also the reason for which we

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,760
need to recruit

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,880
to avoid the burnout of the individuals

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,000
and also to

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,079
support each other uh to prepare the

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
or to prepare the potential turnover

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,279
related to the

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,600
difficulty of the activity and our task

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,800
is mainly based on the meditation the

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,399
mediation sorry

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,120
the mediation uh the purpose is to

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,959
struggle against the isolation that we

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,399
can feel when we are developer and in a

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,000
difficult situation

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,720
uh and supporting uh but of course

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
the area is uh is not so easy because

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,560
when doing that

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,279
uh also of course there are some some

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,160
teams

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,040
and it's not always easy to to to to

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,480
maintain

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,920
the the the quiet atmosphere in the

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,279
in the teams um to talk about the main

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,720
tasks we did this this year um i would

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,160
say we have about

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,480
we we addressed about 25 requests

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,959
and we could uh we received the sorry we

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,160
received about 25 requests

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,600
and we could address about 15 among them

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,639
uh the others weren't easy to to address

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,440
and some

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,160
then are yet opened and we are we are

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
addressing

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,160
them um the

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,160
main part of the action where uh the

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,120
origin of the action

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,160
is a report from a member of the

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,200
community about

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,440
a message which is aggressive uh it's

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
not so much a big problem for us when

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,120
it's

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,560
a message on the mailing list internal

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,760
of deviant because

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,320
it's a team problem management and so in

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,760
such circumstances we easily can

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,800
explain to the people how we think

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,519
the thread may be more constructive and

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,079
quiet

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,560
and more welcoming for new contributors

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,600
and to

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,800
to to be sure that we don't uh uh we

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,160
we don't say that persons that their

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,360
our atmosphere is not is not welcoming

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,480
uh the same thing happens on brexilla

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,560
where we needed to to to give advice uh

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
to the package maintainers or the bug

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,279
reporters

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,480
uh so that the the community stays

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,880
welcoming and the dialogue to stay uh

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,320
positive and constructive

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,600
um so we also

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,160
uh and it's so in our responsibilities

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
so it's

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,920
not the most difficult situation even if

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,519
as i said

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:53,120
uh earlier the the the job itself is not

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,320
is that easy uh we we had some mediation

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,600
tasks uh

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,199
beyond the mailing list uh because

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,519
well it's probably the most difficult in

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,560
our responsibilities but our purpose is

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
to support

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,639
the reporter but not blaming the targets

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,160
or understanding a situation without

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,320
blaming the reporter

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,360
or blaming the targets because it's

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,639
important to

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,880
be sure that no one feels humiliated by

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,880
a

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,959
reaction and that's not easy of course

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,079
because it depends a lot of uh

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,639
criteria related to the each person

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,920
the culture and the other or the other

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,800
other features

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
and um that we we have to do that in

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,240
many

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
many cases uh so it's a very interesting

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,440
job but

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,920
also uh it's uh it's of course somewhat

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
um

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,240
somewhat difficult um and the last thing

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,120
uh i can mention about that is that we

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,160
um

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,519
try to uh we try no

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,240
we were requested uh to moderate uh

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,720
the user's mailing list in debian it's

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,920
more difficult for us to do that because

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,199
uh in such circumstances we have to have

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,040
to take action somewhat different

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,120
that is remind that remember for the end

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,279
users a code of conduct

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,440
but be aware that the kind of conduct is

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,760
not necessarily known by any paper in

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,399
the

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,000
user's community it's rather known in

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,839
the living contributors community

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,639
instead of the users community so we

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,120
we we have to do this remind and also we

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,360
try to disconnecting the thread

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,399
so that of course we maintain a

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,399
welcoming

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,680
community with uh respect between people

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,279
on the capability to to to have a

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,720
constructive dialogue

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,839
um so well where

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,759
here was um for us the first one

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,720
uh which enabled also to the new ones

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,199
just like me or some other people to to

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,279
learn

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,959
uh what we can do how we can do and uh

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,040
don't forget of course we are volunteers

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,199
so we are professional of the mediation

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,320
uh and those are the different topics

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,800
about training

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,399
about uh debian supporting training for

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,040
the community team or it's an idea we

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,759
could

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,639
we could discuss uh because well we are

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,920
professional but

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,560
we we had to to to address that and uh

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,160
that's

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,759
the reason for which it's so important

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,440
to have a team on the

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,880
relevant team just like we are with the

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,320
diversity team

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,120
uh because just like i said the problem

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,839
is that

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,199
uh the reaction of people depends on

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,519
many many things

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,320
and so it's very important as much as we

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,600
are diverse

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,320
as much as we are chance to not hurt

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,519
someone

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,160
and to be sure to to respect it uh so

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,160
it's it's

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,360
personally the the the kind of

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,880
balance i i i i propose about the

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,839
about this the first year in the

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,839
community team

00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:09,120
that's it for me

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,120
uh look you're muted

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,720
uh and i guess uh going off of that like

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,160
an example of like what uh

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,559
the importance of the team recruiting

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,679
more diverse members like

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,959
if we get say somebody asking us uh

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,000
hey is this um this content in the

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,520
studying package

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,679
unacceptable um uh and it's like

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
it's some nazi symbol like we can

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,919
definitely say yes that's offensive

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,600
that's

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,440
that's inappropriate um but if it's uh

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,960
say something that's not something we

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,160
have experience with we

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,160
like are just not really aware of like

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,400
the cultural context um

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
that's that's where i think we can kind

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
of struggle

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,799
uh and uh so having more

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,559
uh more people with different

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:01,600
experiences from different cultures

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:05,200
would be extremely helpful

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,760
i um i

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,720
would add to that uh that

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,520
we also have a lot of differences of

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,440
opinion

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,120
um so i think the idea of like offensive

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,320
messaging or offensive imagery

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,480
when it's a cultural conversation is

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,679
a really useful example um because

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,960
it's not just us knowing what's like

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,160
offensive to like say in germany versus

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
what's offensive

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,400
and sri lanka um but also like

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,840
having people's opinions on whether or

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,840
not

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,960
identified or would they be offended by

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,200
it because

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,880
it's hard to defeat whether or not

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
something is inappropriate if you have

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,120
no experience with it

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,960
or if you're not tied to like the group

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,960
being attacked

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,559
yeah precisely that it's like we we can

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,799
do research and see

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,559
that like it has been talked about in

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,200
certain places but like

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,240
it's hard to like turn that into well in

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,240
this context

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:16,559
is this specific thing problematic um

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,559
so yeah

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,360
so as with that as a background um

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
let's open it up for discussion a little

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,880
um

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,919
we'd like to go through you know

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,039
an example a case study and see how how

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,000
other people

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:40,400
would deal with um

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,039
you know with with you know a fictional

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,760
example that might be very close to

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,960
one or two that we've had to deal with

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,080
um

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:55,520
molly do you want to talk through this

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,720
sure um so it's in the ether pad there's

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,760
a link to that

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,960
in the notes um

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,960
or the chat uh i will read it it is

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,440
quick um alice and bob

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,039
are both deputy developers they have a

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,320
technical disagreement and begin to

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,640
assault one another

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,159
their relationship permanently sours and

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,679
every few months they attack each other

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,280
on public mailing lists

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
every time this happens they report each

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,159
other to the community team

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,000
as do other people um so

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,280
you know there we have two people who

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,960
don't get along they just don't get

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,640
along anymore at this point

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,640
um and their relationship

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,360
uh has definitely reached a point where

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,039
it impacts the rest of the project

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,559
and how other people see the debian

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,520
project because their

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,520
fights are in public

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,320
so i i would like to hear more about

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
what people think the right thing to do

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,880
in a situation like this is

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,159
and either people who are on the

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
community team or people who aren't on

00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:03,840
the community team

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:03,840
should feel welcome to speak up

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,400
um i'll kick it off by saying that it to

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,919
me it seems like the

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,280
the first step in any situation like

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,320
this is to reach out to the people

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
involved

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,120
um and ask them what they think about

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,520
but also like what they

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,960
would want to have happen um

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,039
uh and when you do that i

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,120
think maybe you're lucky and the people

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,960
have very concrete things that they want

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,039
uh and those are achievable that's

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,520
something that you can make happen

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,880
um but i think a lot of the time what

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,520
people want

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,799
uh when they have an ongoing problem

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,720
with one another

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,000
like is not easily flexible

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
and it's not the kind of thing that you

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,440
can just say okay well

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,840
like just talk it out or you

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,720
need to be polite to each other and stop

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,840
being like

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,840
stop insulting each other in public

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,400
so do we have anybody who's not on the

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,360
community team who

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,919
is prepared to volunteer uh what they

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,679
would

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,039
consider doing or what they would like

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
to see happen in that situation

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,960
hi everyone um i'm christy unfortunately

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,440
i couldn't hear the whole

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,520
um the whole example so i'm trying to

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,760
read it over the after bed

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,720
um so it might take to me like a few

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,720
minutes to read it

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
always

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
well christie's feeling that i guess the

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,520
the first thing to recognize

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,799
is there is no right or wrong wrong

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,640
answer to this

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,400
there may be many wrong ways to do it

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,840
but there's there is no fixed

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,840
right answer

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,960
i think that sums up most of

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
what we do which is that there are wrong

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,799
answers but there aren't

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,840
frequently right answers and sometimes

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
there is no right answer

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,559
um hi so i'm back i read it um

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,440
i think that in a situation like this i

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,120
think it would be

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,679
best if um one moderator would suggest

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,799
for

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,520
um for both of them to like take some

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,200
time off

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,400
until they cool down or at least

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,000
like probably to not uh they shouldn't

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,600
ride for some time

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
so until you know the situation gets a

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,440
little bit

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,039
um like let's say cooler i think that

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,520
then they would be ready to

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,840
re-talk with each other and probably

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,120
come back with you know other ideas but

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,159
i think that the best

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,559
would be to leave some time

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,039
uh off without you know writing in the

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,159
mailing list i think that it

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,760
it um is a task that i would happily

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,960
leave it in on the hands of the

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
moderators

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,279
that probably are selected by the

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,279
community

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,440
so are you proposing like a um

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,159
they shouldn't post mailing lists at all

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,360
or is this more like an interaction ban

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,159
uh so i i used to be on english

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,520
wikipedia as

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,440
our arbitration committee and like

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,000
often what we would do is we would say

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
okay you two can't play nice together

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,559
so you are like the two of you are not

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,360
allowed to be involved in like

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,960
the same discussion uh or like you're

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,000
not allowed to like reply to the other

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,039
person

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,080
um i i worry about

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,360
imposing that on debian

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,120
threat mailing lists uh but it's

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,720
basically the idea is like it's nicer

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,400
than a full ban and because there's like

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
a very large encyclopedia to write you

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,679
can just

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,960
easily avoid whatever articles other

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
people are writing on

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,080
but in debian i i worry that like the

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,600
more targeted interaction ban

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,000
would exclude people

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,720
too much uh given that we just don't

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
have

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,279
a lot of different important discussions

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,200
uh

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,200
but at the same time like i i think like

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,000
don't post to the list at all

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,440
is is pretty harsh it basically it's

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,480
basically like excommunicating both

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,840
parties

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,840
from technical discussion

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,120
um i would suggest um to like stop

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,039
like those people to stop like talking

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,559
for that specific topic

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
and i know that probably it may be a

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,559
little bit harsh to like you know

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,320
stop people from you know writing and

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,080
talking but i think that

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,840
for the benefit of everyone would be

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,559
better if they could take some time off

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,679
and

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:23,200
maybe come back with um cooler

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,279
you know and better ideas ah so

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,799
like basically like a topic ban like as

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,240
in the specific thing that is that you

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,000
have a dispute about

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,600
yeah for example if they are fighting

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,039
over something technical you know it

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,799
would be best if

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,080
they could you know stop talking about

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,039
that or you know being

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,760
um forbidden to write on that topic

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,039
right if

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,320
you're good if you're getting so like if

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,159
you're getting into like an argument

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,279
with people about systemd

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,320
uh and like you know both parties are

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,080
are not engaging constructively on that

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,480
yeah okay that makes sense you just

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,960
thank your atomic band and systemd

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
makes sense

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,679
i'm also interested in this idea

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,679
of saying to people that you just can't

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,520
respond to each other on

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,880
say debbie and private or deputy and

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,400
project um

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,880
i think there are plenty of ways around

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,880
that but i wonder what it would

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,520
look like to tell people that they just

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,880
can't talk directly to one another

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,000
i think i think we've seen that uh

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,039
in recent history where where what

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
happens is the

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,039
one of the parties that feels aggrieved

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,520
suddenly starts popping up

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,279
with multiple different mailing lists as

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,320
different identities

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,640
so it's quite a hard one to to to to

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
limit

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,000
well in that case we're talking about

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,399
like actual

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,760
like abuse like i i don't

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,480
i believe that's the scenario we're

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,399
talking about on the pad it's it's got

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,919
it's got past the technical issue in our

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,279
hypothetical scenario

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,679
and they are beginning to attack each

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,640
other in public lists so when we're not

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,760
dealing with

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,919
um at this point we're not dealing with

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,760
uh a technical discussion anymore

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,120
they're beginning to insult one another

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,440
and it's

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,799
it's spilling into public yeah i mean i

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
i i think like

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,480
if you're talking about different

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,760
identities uh and like

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,399
uh using subterfuge to uh astroturf or

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,159
whatever

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,600
then like that's clearly like whoever's

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,200
doing that like that

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,960
that's not they shouldn't be in the

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,240
project um

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,440
but i but

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,080
uh i i think like a lot a lot of just we

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,880
have a lot of

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,520
issues like this that where people don't

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,679
escalate

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
to things that are inappropriate in that

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,399
degree

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,320
where they're just you know using their

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,360
own identities continuously sniping at

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,080
each other

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,120
um because they have a beef over

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,600
something

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,799
uh that they can just in this case is

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,080
technical in nature

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,760
um so so yeah like

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,440
we need to do more aggressive things

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,559
when people go

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,919
far off the reservation and we do but

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,279
like fortunately like most of that's not

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,120
even handled like that's not a community

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,320
team at this point that's list master

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,440
or like moderation um because

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,080
our goal is is to help people who are in

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
the community

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,720
work better if you're like

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,399
making sock puppets and that sort of

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,399
thing you're outside of every community

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,399
sure so it's it's a reasonable

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,600
suggestion that christy had of of a way

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,039
to help people

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,240
before they get to that extreme position

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,640
um and you know it's the kind of thing

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,120
that

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,840
we've suggested to people um so yeah

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,039
that that's a

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,799
a that's a good way to go

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,640
thank you does anybody else have any

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,080
ideas on on

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,080
things that things that we could do

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
there

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,520
um if we're ready to move on to the

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,200
another topic i actually have another

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:15,440
question i'd like to kind of pose to

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:19,279
the group sure go ahead

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,279
um so

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,000
let's say we have a debian developer um

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,440
will name i don't remember that

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,039
eve is another one of the names right

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,640
yeah eve so we have

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,679
eve the developer who in debian

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,600
is very polite to everyone

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,880
doesn't do anything wrong but eve's

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,399
twitter account

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,760
is just a disaster um and

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,960
attacks people outside of w all the time

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,960
and is super offensive and is

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,600
transphobic and homophobic and racist

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,279
and sexist and like all the bad things

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,840
um that we don't like and that we think

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:02,000
makes an unwelcoming community

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,480
uh so what's debian's role

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,679
in interacting with eve and with eve's

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,679
presence in the community

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,080
and of course that is a really really

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,360
difficult one to answer

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,120
which of course is where you're at which

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,120
is why you're asking this question

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,559
you know how far should debian be

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,440
worried about people's

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,000
interactions that you know from people

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,640
not

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,600
entirely within debian communication for

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,200
um you know if p if people are spamming

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,840
the mailing list with hate

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,960
it's a fairly obvious clear-cut case you

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,960
know if they're

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,039
shouting at people on ilc all the time

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,000
and being as you say homophobic racist

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,360
whatever

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,320
it's a very very easy call it is much

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,600
more difficult

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,080
to deal with you know

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,320
even to deal with the question should we

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,360
be policing people's

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,640
activities when it is not obviously

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,600
directly on

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,600
debian forums

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,000
i don't know i actually have no idea

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,120
here oh sure absolutely i was about to

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,200
say so

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,960
within the team we're cut we're quite

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,120
split over this as well

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,159
you know it it's not an easy question to

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,760
answer

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,440
um should we be um

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,960
warning people that their actions

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,840
outside of the

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,440
the visible debian community are making

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,080
people uncomfortable

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,640
or should we totally reign ourselves in

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
and say

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,480
that's not in debian therefore we we

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,559
have to percent pretend we didn't see it

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,240
it's a difficult call and different

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,519
people have very different ideas about

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,240
this

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,279
molly um so in this context in this

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,600
hypothetical

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:58,720
is this person uh expressing these views

00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,080
um just about people so it was just like

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,039
in general like saying that these are

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,120
things like

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,279
this they're just saying like homophobic

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,360
transphobic or racist things or whatever

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,039
uh on their blog or whatever and it's

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,559
been it's not being published in the

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,600
debian and they're not talking about

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:19,919
um they're being developers

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,919
or the wider free software community

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,159
like if someone was just saying that

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,760
like uh

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,919
someone just was saying that like they

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,799
they agree with uh

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,799
uh you know jk rowling that uh trans

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,320
that the trans women aren't women

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,840
like and they were just posting that

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,039
sort of stuff

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,039
or is it here like they are in

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,159
non-debian channels

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,360
actually discussing specific

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,080
people in debian

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,760
or the wider free summer community uh

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,120
let's say they're not talking about

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,799
anyone specifically

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,120
within the debian or free software

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,200
community um

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,240
and this is one of those things where i

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,559
think it's like really

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,559
important to also know that there are

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,000
lots of times when we all have very like

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,200
i have a very strong opinion

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,320
and just visceral reaction to like

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,280
this idea and this example but

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,359
what i like personally think is maybe

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,000
different than what i think

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,720
like if i talk through to myself what i

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,879
think the team

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,560
should do or what i think though like

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,159
debbie and should do

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,960
are are different because to to be very

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,240
candid

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,000
like working with someone like that

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,760
would just make me uncomfortable and i

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,240
would not be into it i would not want to

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,399
like

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,720
touch their work but do i think that

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,679
that's a stance that the team should be

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,480
taking is

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,480
like i don't know

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,399
there are a couple of comments on irc

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,639
so can i if i can come back to that

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,440
there's a question that's been asked

00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,760
whilst uh we read the irc comments

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:06,400
um a lot of it to me is down to

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,960
how that person is presenting themselves

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,040
outside of the debian community if

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,760
they're presenting themselves

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,480
as a voice of debian an ambassador for

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,520
debian

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,280
uh um and these are

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,720
an opinion uh that they

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,720
are um publicly saying

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,400
this is my belief oh and by the way i'm

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,800
i'm representing debian

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,160
in this and this not necessarily uh

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,359
overlapping

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,800
in those but if in the in the same form

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,920
that they are

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,920
being abusive or um

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,440
definitely outside of the code of

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,599
conduct and

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,640
in that form they are trying to pass

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,760
themselves off

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,440
or represent themselves as wearing a

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,240
debbie and hatting some description

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,599
absolutely we need to intervene it

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,280
becomes harder

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,520
when they are trying to keep

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,720
if you like separate separate images of

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,079
themselves where they have

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,119
no overlap of their

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,680
debian hat into the into the particular

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,200
form

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,599
i believe you use the example of a

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,800
twitter account if there is never any

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,640
mention of debian

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,280
in that twitter account how do we

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,240
um respond to them there other than

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,560
saying

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,280
is this you know getting a confirmation

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,079
out of that

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,040
that individual that yes that is them

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,000
and saying that we are aware of this

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,000
um what do you want to do about it and

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,440
and and so to put the question back on

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,880
on on onto onto them of

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,280
what they think they should be doing

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,280
about it

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:59,920
yep

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,920
i spy a wonder has joined us

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,280
uh yes about the

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:12,240
issue of people saying

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,240
hateful stuff outside of deviant

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,800
it clearly is a difficult situation and

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,839
i

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:25,200
agree that it's it's

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:27,760
hard the community team or or people

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,760
can't be

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,240
required to monitor such things but i

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,320
think that's

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,560
out of the question anyway when

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,839
the question is mostly about when

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,359
reports about such thing come in

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:49,760
and i think if

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:52,560
people are representing

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,359
opinions outside the project that they

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,480
hold

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,280
which are against the community

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
that we want to have within the damien

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,359
project

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,480
i think that's something that was still

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,000
to some degree

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,359
need to address even if it's not

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,000
directly um presented

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:19,280
on debian services

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,640
because it has obviously it

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,960
is in the mind of those people and it

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,320
has an impact on how

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,440
those affected by these hateful commands

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,720
uh the minorities and and

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,720
um discriminated against people

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,720
feel safe within the community

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,400
so it's a in in this kind of a situation

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,800
it's it is worth

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,200
in my opinion talking to the people

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,000
involved and asking them

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,520
how they think it might affect others in

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,640
the community

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,920
you know if if you are you know touting

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,400
hate against

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,240
certain you know against certain groups

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,240
how would people from those groups

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,920
be be willing to interact with them

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,720
within debian and the free software

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,720
community it's

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,599
it's a conversation to have um the

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,680
difficulty of course is

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,000
if the person involved doesn't

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,440
understand that there might be a problem

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,640
what do we do then wonder um

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,240
yeah it's it's very important that you

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,359
raise the concern about um asking

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,960
the people that are affected by

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:44,000
what was said uh or written there um

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,520
to to check in with them what

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,280
they need to to feel comfortable or what

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,560
they need to to sort of say

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,599
okay we sort of

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,920
can live with that or i just

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,079
don't want to interact with that person

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,440
at all but it's fine if they are in the

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,200
community as a whole

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,640
so checking in with the affected people

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,079
what what's their their need to

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,920
to feel comfortable yeah yeah

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:21,119
so uh dda you you raised your hand

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,079
yeah um i think an important point here

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,480
is also to

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,680
not forget that we are a self-built

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
community and we're not

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,839
a community that by definition that will

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,319
accept everyone

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,319
and i think it's still important to to

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,240
accept that we are

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,560
choosing who we want to do this project

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,240
with and i think

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,560
to some extent at some point there are

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,480
limits to who

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,359
and which types of individuals we want

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,680
to welcome and someone who doubts racist

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,960
things outside of debian out on

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,079
non-debian

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,800
stuff might someday join the devconf

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,800
with a racist

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,119
tattoo and what what do we do about that

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,440
so

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,720
it's it's a very hard line to draw but

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,280
at some point we might

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,040
want to say well we don't want to work

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,319
with racists and

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,240
it's more important for us to do a

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,920
free software operating system without

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,920
racists than to allow everyone

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,040
yeah andy you had your hand

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:35,839
you're muted

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
i was trying to say yes i i i hear very

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,680
much what ronda was saying and what

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,040
peter was saying

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:53,280
of we've got an issue potentially also

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,880
of fiction um we've got what we can

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,000
see and control inside our own

00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,119
environments uh inside our own community

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,280
um but

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:07,440
we we have no authority

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,040
uh outside of that community so in that

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,040
particular media space

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,960
where the person is being hateful um

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,720
other than joining as a member and

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,760
calling them on it

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,200
there is very little we can do in that

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,400
space

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,760
molly i think you were next

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,599
yeah um so

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,720
i i have a sub question off of this

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,960
um now which is like are

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,400
we only responsible for people within

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,319
the debian project

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,560
are we responsible for everyone who

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,079
might want to be a debian user someday

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,240
or everyone we hope would be a debian

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,079
user um

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,319
like let's let's say there's there's

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,800
some particular demographic

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,400
that we just don't have any debian

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,359
community current debian community

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,119
members in

00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,640
um like uh secretly there are vampires

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,920
so there is a vampire

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,560
uh and then there's someone who is a

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,640
vampire hater on the internet

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:12,240
uh like should we

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,240
ban them or or like handle them

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,599
in the same way we would handle someone

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,119
insulting

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,640
like people who we know are part like

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:27,200
demographics that we know are already

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:29,440
part of the community

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,839
now i've just been plotted that we are

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,160
kind of running out of time here

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,160
so

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,280
i think we have time for maybe one more

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,839
question but it'll a point it'll have to

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,839
be really quick

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:57,440
we have a fellow debianite

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,440
who appears to be muted

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:05,520
i'm sorry i was trying to have my name

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:09,040
um hey so switching from the stream to

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,040
the ttc and i don't know what

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,640
ufc channel um

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,160
based on that the other discussion that

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,760
was going on about

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,359
people saying things on twitter or

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,800
whatever

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,640
and the point i was making on is that

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,240
i think the main question to us is

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,560
whether um

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,560
debian cares about how the people feel

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,240
inside the community and

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,079
like somebody was saying just a minute

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,400
ago whether david wants to have

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,040
racists in its ranks or not or it's more

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,319
important to accept everybody

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,160
and i think that's the question that

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,920
david needs to answer

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,359
and that couldn't form the decisions on

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,319
how to handle it

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,880
i know i don't want him in a project

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,599
where

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,880
there are people that hate me wish to

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,000
see me

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,640
dead or not there no matter what no

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
matter where

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,000
they say that no matter when

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,839
i don't want to be sharing a space with

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,160
other people

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,160
um

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,440
yeah i think that's the main issue i

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,440
mean i think it's pointless to

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,280
to try to solve this problem thinking

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,440
whether the kind of conduct applies or

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:39,599
not or technicalities like that

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:43,200
and the question to answer is no profile

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,520
sure that's her point thank you

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,720
um we don't really have time to go any

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,160
further than that

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,640
i'm afraid thank you for people

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,560
jumping in and asking questions and

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,880
responding to some of our questions

00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,920
it's been a really useful conversation

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,160
all i will say is

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,680
you know where to contact us community

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,760
debian.org

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,839
um please we're always looking for more

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,079
volunteers if you think you can help if

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,160
you have good ideas on how to

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,720
to help with the work and making debbie

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,480
in a more welcoming community

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,800
we hope to hear from you soon thanks

everybody and for the sake of video team

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,599
