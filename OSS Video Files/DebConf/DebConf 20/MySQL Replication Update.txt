MySQL replication has been around for well over a decade and the latest version of MySQL has a lot of advancements.  InnoDB cluster provides a fault tolerant, highly available cluster. Groups can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic primary election, where only one server accepts updates at a time with read-only replicas to split the load. Alternatively, groups can be deployed in multi-primary mode, where all servers can accept updates, even if they are issued concurrently. And to make bringing a new cluster member online easier,there is a clone plugin permits cloning data locally or from a remote MySQL server instance. Cloned data is a physical snapshot of data stored in InnoDB that includes schemas, tables, tablespaces, and data dictionary metadata to have the new system operational as quickly as possible. MySQL Router is a Level 4 proxy to handle the flow of your data. Plus there are utilities in the New MySQL Shell, mysqlsh, for the easy administration of a cluster.  So if you have not looked at MySQL replication in a while your will be happily surprised with the new features and performance.
