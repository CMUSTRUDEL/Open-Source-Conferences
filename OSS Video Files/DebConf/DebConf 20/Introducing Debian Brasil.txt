On this talk I will tell you how I met Debian Brasil community and years later I become one of the local leaders on efforts to bring Debian to all brazilians, helping on events and others projects. 

I will show all the work we have done here in Brazil for the last years, inclunding organize MiniDebConfs, DebConf19, and other events. Producing content on  a YouTube channel. Producing merchandising stuff as t-shirts, stickers, mugs. And so on.

and i'd like to start it telling you

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
that

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,640
i met linux in 2000

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,840
when i started to study computer science

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,479
in my university here in critical

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
that time i met linux and i met debian

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,079
true because the labs

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
of the computer science department

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,799
was was running debian so i had my first

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,399
contact with

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,920
linux and debian in 2000

00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:00,079
for some years i just um

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,520
i just saw debian as a a technical

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,080
technical tool to use a computer

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,640
but i started to see a local group uh

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
some people here in critical they

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,959
started to organize

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,920
some some meetings some

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,360
some talks about debian and they founded

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,360
a debian user group

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
called debauchery

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,319
is our state brazil is very similar to

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
the

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,040
united states of america because we have

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,400
26 states and

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,080
that time in 2004 2000 2000

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,280
2004 2005 uh debbie community here

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
brazil decided to

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,239
organize a lot of debian user groups

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,239
but as a state

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,840
state design debt user groups instead of

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,519
focus in local in this cities

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
instead of found

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
local groups in their cities as you can

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,920
see here

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:13,200
in this page we had a lot of

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,319
debit user group for first stage as

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,560
amazon parana

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,480
where i where i live me and danielle to

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,319
creative is the capital of the paradise

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,760
state

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,799
but basically this group were were

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,120
state groups but the people didn't

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,560
did not travel around the states to talk

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
about the debian

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,599
and the other things by the way other

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,959
communities started to found

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,000
state groups as php and

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,080
php community python community and

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
many others i don't know why they

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,799
decided this that

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,080
was better found

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,840
state groups instead of city groups

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,640
i personally prefer city groups than

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,080
states so

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,760
we had a lot of people

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,560
talking about debian using debian

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,879
especially

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,320
working for debian for many years

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,680
and they they started to to

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,440
go uh by the way in 2004 it's good to

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,479
remember that in 2004

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,759
we had debbie comfort here in porto

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,960
alegre city

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,919
here in brazil so probably uh

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,680
debiconf4 uh helped to this group to

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,919
encourage these groups to work for

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,840
debian in

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:45,680
that time in 2004. so we had we had

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,240
uh a very very

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
very big movement from diving community

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,639

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,280

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,880

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,000

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,720

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,560
and we have some

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,880
some fights unfortunately some strong

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,920
opinions about

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,959
what people thought in that that

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,880
that years that made that

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:59,360
work that are done here in our community

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:03,200
so after to after 2010

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,800
ah by the way i can show you here that

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,880
since 2004

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,399
um brazilian community

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,880
started to particip to go to

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,160
events as fizzly like like i said

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,680

debian day brazil here and many fisley

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:30,000
but as you can see here uh after 2010

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,959
we debut decreased

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,160
its partic this particip participation

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,680
in this this event

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,120
because many people felt

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,320
very very hurt

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,600
about some wars that was said in that

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,720

to debbie of 12 and for

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:59,600
some years after uh debian brazil

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:03,760
basically stop the aliro

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,959
as a community as a national community

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,160
um personally

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,839
personally my my biggest disappoint was

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,959
in 2013

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,040
because in that year

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,200
i helped you to organize a meeting at

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,240
fizzling

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:30,079
as you can see here in 2013

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,519
i hope to organize a meeting there and

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,880
we are trying to he burned the

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,800
national community debian national

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,399
here but

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,160
after this meeting uh one ddg

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,200
said to me that we we couldn't decide

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,959
anything in in

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:59,279
this meeting because it was and

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,920
it was not our official meeting and we

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,639
we that organized this this meeting we

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,160
are not

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,680
debian developers so basically he

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,279
validated all that we had decide there

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,399
this and i felt very very upset

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,200
about that because we are trying to make

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,760
debian debian project here

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,760
and

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
back had returned to the good years

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,279
where

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,839
when debian project had a lot of

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,000
work here in brazil but then

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,120
unfortunately we had this

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,639
this opinion to us we had to heard this

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,600
opinion from

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,720
a brazilian dev and developer and i

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,360
personally

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
decided to give up i said i gave up to

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,120
to help

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
debian project here in brazil because it

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,600
seems too hard

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,000
to work with some debian developers here

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,240
and i don't know i don't i don't want

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,399
this for me

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,880
i talked of some friends some some

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,959
debian contributors they are they were

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,800
in that that occasion they were not dead

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,120
developers yet

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,519
and you said yeah let's let's create a

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,760
debian brazil community

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,800
not not as a debian um

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,839
not as deviant project here in brazil

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,959
but just a community with people that

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,320
are naughty demon developers people that

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,880
just wanted to make um

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,160
to make it works for debian as in

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,240
general

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,360
and we we started to to write it

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,240
right public tastes again in this blog

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,680
this blog is called debian brazil i

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:52,399
remember in that occasion

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:55,440
i i created the domain whenbrazil.org.br

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,440
but again when they decided to me that

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,639
i couldn't do that because i didn't have

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,600
authorization

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,279
authorization to create a domain uh

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,720
using debian name

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,040
i said okay but i would do the same way

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,000
i

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,360
i'm doing this sorry but i doing this

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,240
and we started to to organize our

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,360
local community our national community

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,720
here

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,600
on this blog but for the beginning we

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,880
said

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,759
this is a community for users

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,120
and developers we are not just

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,360
developers

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,360
we are a community especially

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,399
user community that anyone can join can

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
write

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
this and can he and everybody can talk

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,480
about

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
debian here

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
so

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,120
in 2000 in 2000

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:01,199
uh in 2014 i i

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,920
like i said uh in 2013

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,560
was my big biggest disappointment about

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,920
this quest

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,839
about the meeting that we had in fisley

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,959
and

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,720
i decided to with some friends

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,600
here in brazil we created a local group

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,680
called nemedy critical livery or free

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,959
criticism

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,079
2000 in 2013

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,199
and we decided to not use it not using

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,560
anymore

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,160
debian user group parana

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,839
as the organizer of the events here in

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,440
critique

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,160
we give up to use the uw's group here

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,079
and you pass it to use equity believer

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,639
as the organization

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:54,000
like as an official organization

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,480
organization to to

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,399
to reunion people that you wanted to

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,600
organize free soft events here in

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,600
critique

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
that free software event that they could

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,839
before like if we saw

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,079
and solve the freedom day and the debian

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,079
day

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,799
so after after 12 2013

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,199
critical level become the local group to

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,679
organize local events

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,839
so basically we are working here with

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,079
critique delivery

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:31,679
and we are working in

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:35,440
in we started to work

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:39,840
as a national group as debian

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,240
brazil community in 2014

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,559
i decided i decided not to be involved

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,440
with or if you're going to

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,320
know it's not not to be evolved your

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,440
organization

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
i went to fizzle in 2014 but i was very

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,360
frustrated

00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,799
frustrated what what was what happened

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,799
one year before and i decided not

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,799
involved with debian again there

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,640
um anyway

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:16,400
uh some some people organized another

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:21,120
meeting there was not so great like

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:24,480
before but they are they tried to

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:29,360
to keep debian uh being

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:34,160
being active in fizzling at fizzling

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,760
so um after this

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:42,880
this this difficult years i we have

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:49,120
the web from 2010 until 2014

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,120
having some difficulty here and in 2015

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,240
the the community debbie community in

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,760
brazil

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,120
brazil is the capital of brazil

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:05,280
decided to organize one event there

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:10,160
college 2015 here

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:14,080
called micro debbie confi brazilian

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,880
so this is the first event

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,480
the event from the debian community here

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,679
in brazil

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,799
organized by organized by the community

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,720
focus only debian they organized the

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,840
event for

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,919
just one day they passed one day talking

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,360
about the debian there

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,559
and edu had they had some

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,400
some derivation developers there too

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:46,240
it was i i i couldn't go there

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,360
but it was very nice so this idea to

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,039
organize

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,720
microderm conf and the talks that we

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,360
have before

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,440
about what was happening here in brazil

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,160
with debian community

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
encouraged us to start to organize

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,120
another events

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,679
so we can say that in 2015

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
the debian community reborn here in

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,679
brazil

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,159
so in july you organized a mini debit

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,280
conf

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,480
inside the fisley 16

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,679
when we went too fastly and organized

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,919
one day with a lot of talks about debian

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:29,120
and in inside one of the auditoriums

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,840
and we saw that the community was very

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,720
happy

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,480
with this first working that you are we

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,120
are doing there

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,919
and we stay obvious we stay very happy

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,600
too

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:45,200
and we decided to to go to latin where

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,919
organize a main debit conf there so 2015

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,000
was a great

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:53,280
year because we can say that 2015

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,799
we have started the game in

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,799
working for debian

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,080
but as i said before

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,080
as a derby community not as a deviant

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,520
project

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,440
in brazil so

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:17,280
we had um we had a debian day too

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,520
here in brazil in many cities

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,080
uh we encourage that that community in

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,120
other cities in brazil could could

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,559
organize

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,440

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,000
the same way was the similar lag

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,280

and one of the auditoriums

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,039
so in 2016

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,000
we decided to to make

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:06,159
to give a huge pass

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,200
a huge step for us that was organized

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,679
i mean they become solo not i mean they

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
become

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,840
inside the other event

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,640
a solo event and in

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,679
another things happened before for

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,240
example

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,720
we had some people here in our community

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,320
in creative

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,440
that started to to

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,120
to be more curious about debian

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,679
and to start to to help to organize this

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,840
first

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,000
that free salt events that i quoted

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,520
before that i said before

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,480
especially especially

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,520
three persons i can say that danielle

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,039
leonardo was one of them

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,799
the other one was samwell somehow hickey

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:06,400
and the other was adriana costa

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:10,159
so they

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,520
and me started to see

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:17,120
um again how they how we could

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,159
help debian so this

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,760
small group wanted

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,720
to to help debian again and

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,000
and before we had another important

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,799
thing that was

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,760
antonio teceru a debian developer here

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,559
in brazil

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:40,000
came to live here in cretib in 2014

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,360
so incredible we started again

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,120
to have a movement to organize something

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,520
here dedicated to debian

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,360
like like i said in brazil we had some

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,960
movement there too

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,400
in brazil we had

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,240
we have uh eriberto motta

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,559
and lucas canashiro too and

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,360
helping debbie communities there to to

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,480
make some

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,480
movement and they thought well

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,840
maybe we can organize a min debbie

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,960

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:24,159
then we organized debbie confi here

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:27,760

uh debbie event solo as

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,240
we can say that it was a a mini debut

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,559
confidential now because

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,679

we had a lot of talks for two days

00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,279
and in parallel of the debit conf

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,120
the ruby ruby team international team

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,559

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,320
um

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,480
parallel of this we we continued

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,600

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,120
remember it was the end i think it to

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,240
it was the end of 2016 and we had

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,120
maybe one or

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,320
less than two months to write a video

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,279
and he put on the

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,440
debit confu week saying to everybody

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,919

adabi coffee here

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:46,559
in 2018. so in 2017

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:51,039
in the beginning of 2017 taiwan

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:53,919
was was choose to host debbie confetti

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,480
what was great i believe it was was the

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,240
best

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,200
option too because maybe

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,640
we are not so prepared to host a debbie

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,399
confit

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,120
and and sure because we could travel to

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,559
taiwan

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,679
in 2018 it was a great travel

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,960
and i was so happy i was so happy to go

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,880
to a debit con

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,559

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,039
not very far country from brazil

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,880
that is terrible taiwan that becomes

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,480
taiwan was

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,399
amazing was was amazing so nice to go

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,640
there

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,640
so

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,799
how uh we we

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,679

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:06,720
consequently

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:10,080
but this time we decided to

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,159
to make debicon for

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,880

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,480
we improved our ability to try to host

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:12,399

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:38,320
um we put our photos in

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,559
public publicly spaces uh

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,080
there are some events in sao paulo as

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,360
crypto heavy

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,559
that you go there to talk about debian

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,360
and and give yourself stickers and the

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,519
other

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,279
merchandising products it's very

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,399
important to

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,760
take photo of the events because

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,480
probably when someone see these thoughts

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,760
they can think to go through on the next

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,440
event

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:12,000

period2

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,640
on debian social stunts because we

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,680
understand

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,200
it's important to have the videos

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,280
in a place not not being youtube

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,880
for everybody

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,520
this this is us a site

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,960
where there are there are a lot of talks

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,599
about free software

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:30,560
including the the talks debian talks

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:33,760
so um let me see if and forget

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:41,839
something but i don't think so

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,839
ah this is in 2000 in 2000

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,560
uh some of peop some of um

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,880
people of derby community if easily they

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,160
were

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,520
worried about what could happen through

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,520
dubnek village

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:03,280
and they they decided to to launch

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,640
what they called backpack

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,760
backpack fundamentals that was

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,560
the the idea to

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,560
to stay talk about debian

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,560
as we can we can

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,880
so uh personally my concern my

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,800
my concern my concern about

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:35,440
what can you do here because uh

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:39,200
some of us now are devon developers

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,320
as me i'm the developer since

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,880
last year somewhere elsewhere developer

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,040
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,320
danielle leonard is developed developer

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,880
2. so

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,240
this this community this web brazil

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,760
community especially here creative

00:37:52,240 --> 00:38:00,800
um best to have a lot of

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:04,079
debit some of them developers inside

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,760
my biggest concern that that we

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,200
don't back for the old years

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,400
where when debian

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,240
debian brazil was back was basically

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,079
debian project

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:24,400
by deadman developers we need to most

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,160
we need to to tell everybody that we are

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,960
development developers

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,720
but debian brazil community is for

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,839
everybody

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,160
from users to development developers we

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,280
don't

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,400
want to close debian

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,960
debian community for only debian

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,960
developers

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,960
because if you do that if you close the

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,560
debian brazil for only developers

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,960
probably

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,160
a lot of people will feel um

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,760
not welcoming and we don't want that we

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,520
don't we want that

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,880
everybody especially users

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,440
can join to debian debian brazil

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,440
community

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,359
for example the in the beginning of this

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,320
year

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,040
a group decided to to create another

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:27,440
debian brazil community

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:31,040
because they wanted to they wanted to

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,760
to make videos to about debian

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,599
and they used the name it debian brazil

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,040
community

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,280
and uh we said

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,160
well we don't need to create a new

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,920
debian developer

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:49,200

because we are open and they said i

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,560
think

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,320
this debian brazil is for demand

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,480
developers your dev and

00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,920
debian brazil is for developers we said

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,119
no it's not

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,000
please if you want if you want to

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,960
create a second debian community brazil

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,319
commission

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,960
there is no problem you you are free to

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,240
do

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,599
everything that you want but

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,920
maybe you are dividing the community

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,560
uh they decided to to create in a way

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,680
but today uh you know unfortunately they

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,960
are very

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,240
uh they stopped a little so

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,839
basically they they are working with us

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,520
now what is great uh

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,880
we decided to create two telegram group

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,079
called demo brazil i think there is

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,760
four or five in debian brazil groups in

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,960
telegram but we have one

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:57,200
the biggest one is administration by us

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,599
that it's a place for for people asking

00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,599
about

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,640
technical stuffs and

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,839
if someone someone has a issue that you

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,480
want to ask

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,440
they can go to this telegram group and

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,200
they ask everything

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:20,560
there and people are very welcome for

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:23,440
newbies and people with some issues

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,240
well i think we we are doing a great job

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,680
here

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,240
and i hope we can

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
we can be

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,440
we can always be a free space for

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,040
everybody uh and

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,839
and maybe we can we can

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,640
we can other communities can see debbie

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,839
and brazil

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,839
as a model but we have a lot of

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:57,200
to to learn with many people there

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,920
and around the world and

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,280
i think the best idea is exchanging

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,160
experience

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,040
uh it's nice to know what people are

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,160
doing in

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,280
india what people are doing in

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,920
south africa of what debian community

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,359
are doing

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,200
in another cities or in other countries

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,839
that you can learn with them um

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,200
to me i had i had a great experience

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,440
last year

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,960
because i went to foster in brussels

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,240
and i could meet uh another

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,280
debian and other debian groups

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,560
there and i could see uh

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,839
debian community uh organize a booth

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,280
there

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,839
and i i could bring this experience that

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,720
i had

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,440
in brussels to our community i talk a

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,560
day

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,680

have a booth as uh

00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,440
in this event before the booth was

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,119
basically um

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,720
like um a room right with with

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:10,000
walls and uh one table

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,280
in the front and in the walls like a

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,560
room

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:19,040
and i i could see that for example

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:22,000
fosdem they use a table in an open space

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,280
with another community it's a very nice
