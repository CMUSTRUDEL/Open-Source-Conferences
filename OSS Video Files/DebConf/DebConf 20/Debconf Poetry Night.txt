During debconf12 in Nicaragua, we met in a bar and had some poetry. It was a great idea that inspired to have on during debconf13 in Switzerland next to the campfire, which also gave it a great ambience. debconf15 in Germany also had one at the "stonehenge" place, unfortunately there was a concert scheduled at the same time, so the idea sort of faded away ...

It would be great to try it once again. I've been personally approached by several people that would be interested to give it another try.  It would be great if people that want to present something can contact me beforehand so that I know about the amount of poetry (self written, something you relate to a lot with potentially some personal remarks, ...) we will have, to see if we can lift this off again. Let's bring back some written thoughts that are moving.
