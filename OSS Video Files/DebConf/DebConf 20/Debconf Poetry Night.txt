During debconf12 in Nicaragua, we met in a bar and had some poetry. It was a great idea that inspired to have on during debconf13 in Switzerland next to the campfire, which also gave it a great ambience. debconf15 in Germany also had one at the "stonehenge" place, unfortunately there was a concert scheduled at the same time, so the idea sort of faded away ...

It would be great to try it once again. I've been personally approached by several people that would be interested to give it another try.  It would be great if people that want to present something can contact me beforehand so that I know about the amount of poetry (self written, something you relate to a lot with potentially some personal remarks, ...) we will have, to see if we can lift this off again. Let's bring back some written thoughts that are moving.

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,119
there have been poetry nights in depth

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,240
comes before

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,760
it's all started out in the 12th

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,280
nicaragua where an

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,920
open mic night or a portrait night was

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
organized in a nearby bar

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,160
and people went there and presented some

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,360
texts which was

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,879
really really nice

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,760
and and uh

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,640
sorry i had to mute the stream because

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,079
you heard me

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,120
talking over myself again um

00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,239
and we had this also

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,440
in switzerland with the campfire which

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,880
which was really really nice

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,439
in the com15

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,560
in hellberg it didn't work out that well

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,159
and sort of faded away but different

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
people asked me

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,759
whether we can hold one again and

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
ask yeah if if there are people willing

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,759
to present the text

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,040
um then i can organize the session

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,320
and so here we are um there will be

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,759
different people

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,640
presenting texts that either they have

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,560
written themselves or that are very

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
meaningful to them

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,360
and they will give a

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,880
short introduction themselves

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,200
and that's mostly how it

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,600
uh how it's going to work

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:04,000
um i think i'm going to start

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,000
off with my text

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,800
i'm not so sure if i should give too

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
much background on it

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,120
um it's re it was written

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,319
in a poetry slam text style

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,080
and i've presented it uh the

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:26,000
german language poetry slam here in

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,959
vienna and it actually

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
made the people where presented it

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,040
nominate me

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,080
for a supporter islam

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,920
mastership i'm still

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,040
quite in awe about that but i hope

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,080
that text resonates with you

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,200
quite well because parts of it were

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,360
also influenced by happenings within the

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,040
diving community

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,720
and that's also the reason why i

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,760
also translated it to english

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,760
so here it starts

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,560
it's so difficult don't tell me

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
how difficult it is to remember my name

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
don't tell me how difficult it is for

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,560
you

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,920
don't tell me how difficult it is to use

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,040
correct pronouns

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,400
don't tell me anything about that it's

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
difficult

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,280
what is difficult don't tell me how

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,480
difficult it is for you

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,920
don't tell me how difficult it is to not

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,360
use the name that every time i hear

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
hurts my inside

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,840
that for every person who hears it

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,480
stores it with the wrong pronouns

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,599
that for every person who hears it plays

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,959
the movie

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,440
of men in the dress in their mind so do

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,040
not tell me how difficult it is

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,680
to remember a name and correct pronouns

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,920
it's difficult to discuss whether the

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,159
difference between a head

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
which even the woman who created it

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,159
understood that

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,799
it's cysts exist and trans excluding

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,840
because

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
it equates body parts with gender having

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
to discuss

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,159
why the symbol of the head chokes

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
you

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,400
and it's difficult to have to discuss by

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
criticizing the head

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
has nothing to do with pictures of

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,799
wolvers

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,120
because them yes i'm absolutely

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,919
for a relaxed approach of wolvers

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,680
yes we were a vulva i'd like to have one

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,320
of my own after all

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,080
and here's the outing so you finally can

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,720
get rid of the question

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
what's in her pants which probably kept

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
you

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,919
occupied since the beginning and

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,680
distracted from the text

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,840
focus people but it has to be possible

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,479
to speak about the liberation of wolves

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,360
without every time telling trans

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,759
women

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,960
that they aren't women without every

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,680
 time perpetuating biologisms

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,240
without every time equating body

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,800
parts with gender identity

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,520
it can't be that hard to break that

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,320
sexism

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,479
done so do not tell me how

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,960
difficult it is to remember a name and

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,160
correct pronouns

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,160
it's difficult to get told by relatives

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
that it doesn't matter which political

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,479
party they get

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,720
involved in to annoy their mayor as long

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,759
as

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
it's not hits party difficult to hear

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,199
them

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
that they decided on a party that says

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,039
that you have

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,919
gender ideology and gender madness

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,400
and those call you a persona non grata

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,800
who wants to destroy society

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
and it's difficult to be told that the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,360
party isn't that

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,120
bad so do not tell me how difficult it

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,440
is to remember a name and correct

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,840
pronouns

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
it's difficult to read within the

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
software project

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,160
whose community was supportive of your

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
transition

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
during the last 15 years to read within

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,199
this community

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,000
that it's just an opinion when a person

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,199
denies to use pronouns of a person

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,400
and wants to go by chromosomes instead

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,880
it's difficult to read essays on the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,600
origin of singular day

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,120
essays on why chromosomes aren't

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
unambitious

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,360
and not a single person pointing out

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,880
that you cannot

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,600
see chromosomes besides that chromosomes

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,039
are not identical with gender and

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,400
chromosomes are not

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,800
binary besides that it's difficult to

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
read

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,720
how cautiously and nicely are they still

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,919
with that person

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
who denies your existence well you have

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,000
to

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,160
while you have been told to not be so

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,759
short-tempered

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,080
with defending yourself so do not tell

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
me

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,319
how difficult all this is for you

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,120
it's difficult to have to say at the

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
airport

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,199
that the re-routing of your flight

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,240
through the united arab

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,960
emirate raids is far from okay

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
through a land where cross-dressing is

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
forbidden

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
a country in which i'm definitely read

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,560
that way

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,639
and it also happens here all the time

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,000
it's also difficult to see

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,720
the puzzled face behind the desk then

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
and it's difficult to think for half a

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
year

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,479
about traveling to a conference in

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
brazil

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,720
the country which has the highest murder

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,800
rate of trans people

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
to have to think about how you can

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
present yourself there

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
to have to think about how you can move

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
around there

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,960
to have to think about how likely is it

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,240
for you to return from there

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,120
so do not tell me anything about it

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,120
i don't want i don't want to hear how

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,039
difficult it is for you

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,879
while me we have to fight to live

00:07:53,039 --> 00:08:00,240
well me we have to fight to be loved

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,840
while me we have to fight to be seen

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,879
as date able while me we

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,840
have to fight to not get abused

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,400
to not receive physical psychological

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,680
violence so do not tell me anything

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,479
about that

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,240
because it makes me wanna puke it

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,800
doesn't let me sleep

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,160
it wakes me up at four in the morning

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,440
and makes me write

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,560
texts like this one and i'm darn

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,919
 tired of not being able to speak

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,560
because of your

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,560
ignorance

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,760
um yes i

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,880
know that text

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:52,720
is quite quite rough

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,720
um but actually yes it kept me

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,920
up at night and this text was actually

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,160
written on the

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:06,080
24th of december last year

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,680
um so but

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,880

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,840
spirits i wonder

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,840
what's wrong with the nights

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,960

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,080
the cold

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,840

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,120
that it's not written by me it's from a

otherwise i will

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,039
come in with the echo here and this is

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,559

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:53,840

by uh nobel laureate ravinder nattego

and it was published back in year 1912.

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,399
the name of the poem is where the mind

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,360

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,080
without fear

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,000
knowledge

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,159
is free where the world has not been

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,600
broken up in fragments

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,240
by the narrow domestic walls where words

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,720
come out from the depth of truth

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,039
where tireless driving stretches its

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,840
arms towards perfection

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,000
where the clear stream of reason that

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,919
has not lost its way

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,120
into the dairy desert sand of dead habit

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,480
where the mind is led forward by thief

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,760
into ever widening thought and action

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:14,559

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,240
i believed in magic until you came by

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,440
he lit a cigarette to puff up some smoke

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,560
and it was me who ended up high

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,839
we were shy at first our journeys had

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,320
just begun

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,000
yet even after ours together we were

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,040
never done

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,560
being a night person i always fancied

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,400
the moon

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,720
you showed me even roads and valleys had

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,640
at you

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,240
i know you didn't like it when we roam

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,480
to the market

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,960
for you were a diva and the highway was

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,880
your red carpet

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,440
walking through it alone now i searched

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,680
the streets again and again

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,400
because you were all ahead and i hope

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,040
you are waiting in the next plane

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,480

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,240
assume

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,680
for that was your makeup and

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,680
fuel your perfume

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,160

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,839
turned around it became silent

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,040
where did you go an endless world of

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,760
channels connection

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,440
to another place that can be more real

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,359
than what is outside

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,440
the only place you are listen to

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,520
enabling you to ask questions without

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,359
looking like a fool forever

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,359
meeting people talking about things

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,680
being able to communicate

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,119
getting answers and finding others being

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,680
in the middle of it all

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:05,839
irc can be both hell and heaven

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,839
sometimes it's both at the same time

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,599
thank you um

00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:21,440
[Music]

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:26,560
is there anyone else who wants to

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:30,079
maybe say something i have a

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:34,079
german language uh poem

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:38,160
that i wrote last year for the

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,920
coming out day it's

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:46,240
uh the the core

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:49,920
context of it is that um

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,720
existence is already a political

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,359
statement

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,079
especially for trans people in this

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,079
society

00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,000
[Music]

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,640
um it's also written in

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,760
high q style so it's this

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,560
three lines with the first and the third

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,680
line

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:39,839
in five syllables and

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,839
the second line in seventh

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:47,440
and we're coming towards

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,440
the end of the session if

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,800
there isn't someone else who still

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:58,000
feels encouraged

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,280
to present something

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,280
i think

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,079
yeah a campus do you want to present

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,079
the last piece

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,560

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,000
a poem that i wrote i will

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,200
it's in spanish then i could

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,680
translate it in english if there's time

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,000

um

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,720
uh it's

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,640
it's not a happy plan but i i could

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,160
translate it

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,160
there's time around that

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,920
um yeah we are

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,839
yeah three more minutes three more

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,599
minutes okay

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,960
well in english it will not sound

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,079
the same but the idea is that uh

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,119
my past was translucent i

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:42,400
thought i could travel

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,040
freely with freedom i thought that the

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,960
mind

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,640
was the path to transform my

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,920
reality i didn't consider

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,440
other beings uh it was like

00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,960
flying in clouds

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,880
uh forgetting that the clouds was

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:08,880
others uh who pushed me

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,000
to my travel to eternity when the others

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:16,319
goes uh the clouds

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,560
in the beings when you are alone

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,200
in uh i don't know how to say

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,599
like alone backwards and you can stop

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,280
that

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:30,800
going backwards uh you you drown

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,280
and and your bones feel like

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,800
you don't you don't feel the bones and

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,560
you understand that

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,680
this is uh this is the way it

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,400
has been always known it's a sad point

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,839
but it is a point

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,839

um i know there's always this kind of

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,200
reluctant to present with a bigger

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,880
audience

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,960
