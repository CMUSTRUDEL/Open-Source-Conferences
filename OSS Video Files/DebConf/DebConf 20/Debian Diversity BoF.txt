For some, talking about diversity within the development community seems to be not part of what Debian is about, and that is Free Software. In this BoF we want to discuss how diversity within the community actually is enhancing and moving forward the project more than assumed, and how different live circumstances actually can lead to different views on how to approach things and thus also stir more creative approaches, for the benefit of all.

welcome

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,679
to the deviant diversity buff

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,120
i'm thankful that a few people have

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
turned up

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,760
i thought about starting

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,599
to give a short background on

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,800
how this diversity team got started

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,239
and what

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,760
ideas popped up what um

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,800
we want to to reach with it

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,160
um so a

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,760
short recap is in

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,360
depthcon 16 in cape town at the last day

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
i was approached by

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,000
a few fellows who

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,399
asked me yeah don't uh

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,039
there's deviant women don't we want to

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,559
start

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:05,439
diving queers or something like that

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:08,960
for for lgbt people too

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,640
so that was sort of the

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,479
initial thought about behind it and

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,600
then a few months passed and and i

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
thought about it

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,799
and and we created the first irc meeting

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,080
and at that point

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,560
i already named the irc channel

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,439
deviant diversity because

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,439
to some degree

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,600
naming it lgbtiq focused

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,960
too much on sexual and

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,960
gender identities

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,960
and it's also in the discussions

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,079
beforehand

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,000
it also came up

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:04,320
whether it might still be a too limiting

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,040
um topic or or

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,479
thought about the the issues that we are

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,480
facing

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,720
within much analyzed groups within

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,720
debian and it's not like

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,120
that deviant is necessarily more hostile

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,560
or specifically hostile towards

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,599
minorities

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,879
i mean i've been part of the deviant

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,239
project

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,360
since 20 years and i had my coming out

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,200
as being trans

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
15 years ago and the demon community was

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,920
the first community

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,840
and and supportive for me

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,680
there and and um

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,120
and through the geographical

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,400
diversity that an online community

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,519
like the deviant project brings along

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,280
with

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,800
we also had kind of

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,280
diverse not just geographical

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:13,120
but also based on on

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,879
origins where people are from and

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,720
when you're communicating via emails the

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,120
only thing is

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
from from another person you see is

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,120
their name

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,959
and and not what they look like so

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,480
it created a sort of possibility

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,000
to to be more open and

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,840
tolerant just because you didn't see the

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,319
other people

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,319
and

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,959
on the other hand um when we have events

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,120
like

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:54,159
dabcon which is

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,519
something about having talks

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,760
and and and getting ideas out

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,680
but it's also a big social gathering

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,879
where you're

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,080
for first starting to to meet up with

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,280
with new people and

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,519
then you start to realize okay

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,760
i had a completely different picture in

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,239
mind of the person i'm mailing back and

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,199
forth with on a daily basis

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,000
and they just looked like completely

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
different

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,199
and like

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,639
when when you're reading mails from sam

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,919
for instance

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,440
uh sam hartman you wouldn't realize that

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,960
he's blind

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,639
and that's just something that you

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,840
might see through some of the

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,320
packages or efforts he is involved with

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:54,320
but also a lot of other things

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,680
play into this and i always perceive the

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,040
living community

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,160
is quite welcoming

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,520
but then there are

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
certain things happening and i don't

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,240
want to

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:15,199
shine too much light on what

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,199
happened like

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:24,160
like in at the depth country mexico or

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,400
like what happened last december

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,080
on dbm project where a person write out

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,440
denied to to call people by their names

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,639
and and use proper pronouns for people

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,360
and said okay and

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
and discussions surrounding that and

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
people

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,320
defending uh that statement but it was

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,759
polite

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,919
which it clearly wasn't and and

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,039
things like that so

00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:01,440
we really can do better

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:04,720
on on some degree and especially we can

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,199
make it and put it out more clearly that

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
we are

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,240
inclusive and and and welcoming people

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,240
and uh trying to find a way to

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
deal with such situations

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,680
and when i think back a few years

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,440
six years ago we had

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,039
a conference a mini deb conf

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,160
in barcelona

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,840
which was really really awesome

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,280
um it was the first deviant women

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,560
uh conference minidepconf

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,759
and it was a lot of people

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,120
um there and

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,599
the topic for the conference was or that

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,360
the aim for the conference was to create

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,840
visibility

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,400
for women and female identifying people

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,400
and

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,240
so they said that everyone

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,880
submitting a talk and and giving a talk

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,000
on premise um is is a person

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,960
who is a woman or at least womanhood is

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,960
something that

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,000
that is uh very meaningful to them

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,680
and that created a

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,319
very interesting concept and and

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,720
i'm very thankful to have been part of

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,319
that

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,280
effort and we had it uh the year later

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,560
in bucharest

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:48,400
also which was to my

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,160
experience quite an interesting one

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,199
and i think um ideas

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,919
like that uh might something that we

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,759
want to

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:04,479
pick up uh but

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,840
on a more broader perspective um

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,000
like during the last two depcons when we

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,400
had these talks

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,319
people even during depconf we usually

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,360
have a

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,680
deviant women lunch

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
where we sit together and then talk

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,160
about

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,520
things within the project

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,959
which we could

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,279
improve or where we could find

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,279
a place to to

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,480
work on issues and

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,399
during the last two webcons

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:53,120
during that lunch

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:57,279
it was somehow proposed by some people

00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,720
that it might make sense to

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:04,800
sort of have the divine women

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,080
efforts merged into the diversity

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,160
effort um

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,560
which i'm uh i find

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,080
quite an interesting approach and and

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,680
and i've

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,839
i think it's a good idea to to

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
merge these efforts because

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
you can create change if you have more

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,800
people

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,399
willing to work on the combined effort

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,760
and the thing

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,959
that the diversity team in my mind

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,959
is set up for is creating

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,080
a movement and a momentum

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:52,480
that will make it more inclusive and

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:56,480
and uh diverse in the end

00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,480
uh to to be more welcoming to

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,800
to under-represented groups that we have

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:09,600
uh within the project

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:13,360
and how we can get there

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,360
this is still one of the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,920
big miracles that i'm i'm still facing

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,519
and i hope that there are other people

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,040
willing to join in

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,800
and also share their

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:33,200
ideas and and thoughts on that

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,240
um so i sort of want to

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,279
open the stage if there are

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,320
people um listening

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,839
in on the stream who think

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
they might want to join in on the

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,000
discussion

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,640
please send me a message on isc and i

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
can

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:58,160
drop you the link to share this

00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:02,000
gtc meeting for those who

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,120
already in um you have

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,320
at the bottom left corner you have this

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,120
hand symbol so i

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,519
would recommend for everyone that wants

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,079
to

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,959
speak up and and share some thoughts on

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,920
it um

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
to raise their hand so we can use this

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
as

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:29,839
sort of mini moderation tool and not

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,839
just speak over each other

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:43,839
so who wants to add something

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:43,839
or should i nominate someone

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
i'm i'm really bad at pointing at people

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
because they don't want to pressure

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,560
others into something

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,680
that they didn't really sign up for but

00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,720
i hope that given that you're

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,720
in the room now

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:11,839
i hope some of you are willing to share

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,839
a few words

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,760
um yeah please go chatham

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,920
okay so since

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:29,920
these efforts have start

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,959
until now um

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,560
how how you

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,279
have you have seen the the growing

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,279
of this

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,639
diversity inside deviant and in other

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,200
free software projects

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:55,200
besides deviant ronda have you

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,959
have you found in another

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,800
freezer communities uh

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:06,800
arise of this diversity

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,160
importance that maybe in the past

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,160
was not present

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,079
um well since

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,839
last year's stepconf i

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:27,120
was approached by the gnome team

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:31,120
they have monthly

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,120
sessions they have a

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,600
an inclusion and diversity in gnome

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:45,120
team specifically set out for that

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:48,560
and they invited me to speak about

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,920
debian in specifically and

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,360
our efforts that we're going on here so

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,800
there is a collaboration going on

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,480
they have some some

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,000
telegram chat they are using

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,560
and through that i also stumbled into a

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,160
more

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,519
bigger um group which is called

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,959
deviant uh diversity and inclusion in

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,079
open source which is

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,040
uh shared amongst

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,399
different uh projects and and people

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:30,959
exchanging information in there

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:34,240
how to improve how to to move forward

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,240
and um

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,959
i think it just to some degree

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:46,240
um what what is important

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:50,480
is in cases of

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:54,240
of when when

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,760
incidents happen and and

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,560
and people from minority groups

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,639
marginalized groups

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,639
are reacting emotionally to it

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:12,000
people shouldn't jump at first to

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,399
to the person that is emotionally wound

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
up

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,360
and and tell them to

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,680
sort of watch their

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,680
tone

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,040
but addressing uh

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:32,240
focusing more on the issue we are

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,240
very often trying to to put

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,560
forwards like um yeah please

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
can you say that in a more respectful

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,519
way or when

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,560
when it actually wasn't disrespectful in

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,880
the first

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,199
sense when when people are pointing out

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,519
discriminatory

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:57,120
uh discriminations and discriminator

00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,240
behavior that's not disrespectful or

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,160
impolite it's just a matter of fact

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:08,480
that pointing out that that other people

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,759
acted impolite um it's also even

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,720
received a perceived impolite and we

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,480
have to

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,880
work on on this empires to

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:24,399
to directly deflect being called that

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,680
and and think about what's going on

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,320
and trying to to walk through

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,320
what happened

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,079
yes um

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:43,680
i'm not sure how to pronounce your

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:51,839
name but you have to unmute yourself

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:51,839
then you can clearly talk

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,919
you're speaking to me i didn't get your

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,039
name yes yes

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,839
um you you'd show just up as

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,360
soon in the in the chat here so i'm i'm

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,640
sorry that i

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:24,000
okay yeah it's me

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,480
okay so uh like i

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
wanted to talk about this geographic

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,840
diversity as well as the gender

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:38,000
diversity aspect for the geography thing

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,960
we have a lot of i.t professionals

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
coming out from

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,840
india but somehow we don't have that

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,960
many contributors to free software

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,520
and the amount of id professionals and

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
say

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,640
uh the debian developers in india we

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,080
have

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,280
like 12 or something so

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,320
that is not a great number so this is

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,640
something

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,760
uh we have been trying to address

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,120
one point is the amount of

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,400
exposure people have

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,559
uh with free software

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
or

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,760
with free software and debian

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,480
especially when you're talking about the

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,080
debian thing

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,520
like i can take the example of now

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,880
we have a team of uh volunteers

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,360
uh that's setting up for that conference

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,200
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,840
in india so with that i got a

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,440
there they were a group of free software

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,480
reviews here that were not

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,440
very active but uh

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
with uh

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,960
depth thing coming up and we have a

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,960
malayalam track in the stepcon

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,440
when they are getting the opportunity to

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,559
interact with the community

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,039
uh more and more people are uh getting

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,039
to

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,160
directly involved with the community

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,559
they are coming

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,520
from the sidelines into kind of

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,120
mainstream

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,080
so uh my uh when you consider the

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,480
geographic thing i think exposure is a

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,600
very important fact like we don't have a

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,760
lot of

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,840
trees of uh what you call debian

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,400
communities of hacker spaces

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,520
or free software communities as compared

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
to western

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,360
world so that's a challenge where these

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,760
students or

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,480
people interested to contribute how they

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,360
get to

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,799
interact how they get the exposure is a

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,240
big challenge here

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,919
and when we consider the gender aspect

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,960
of the thing the scenario is

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,080
entirely different we have a lot of

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,250
restrictions

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
on

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,320
[Music]

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,440
women like when they uh

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,120
there is restriction on how much time

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,120
they can spend online

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,000
or we have people

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,799
saying that their brother can spend a

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,440
like stay

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,280
all night doing whatever they want but

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,559
girls are supposed to be

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360
uh like offline by so and so time that's

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,320
one thing

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,200
and there are other issues like uh they

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,320
don't even have

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,919
access to laptops even when they are

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,640
doing a computer science

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,200
engineering course so those are the

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,320
things

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,919
which are very systemic which needs to

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,280
be addressed before which

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,520
we cannot uh solve the gender aspect but

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,960
uh here we are trying a lot like

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,080
different approaches

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,240
how to uh make people

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,720
more and more inclusive and

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,440
yeah but i don't have a solid plan as

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,880
such

00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:01,520
and i'll be happy to work with you for

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,320
any of the diversity related activities

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
yeah that's it

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,840
thanks um you were in parts

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,360
not that easy to to hear i think that

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,679
there was some network

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,640
connection difficulties but

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,679
i think for most i understand what you

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,400
meant

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:30,159
let me try to sort of sum it up

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:34,000
you say that there's a lot of id

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:38,400
professionals coming from india but

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,520
just a handful or 10 to 12

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,440
are parts of the debian community

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:50,159
and because there is not so much

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:53,360
this hacker spaces or possibilities to

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
sort of enroll the i.t professionals

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,960
from

00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,000
from india and and

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,559
to to get them involved in free software

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,360
and in the debian community in general

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:10,640
did i sort of catch that properly

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:15,120
yes okay yeah i

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:19,120
see to some degree i think um

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:23,840
it it also boils down to

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:27,280
at what time events like this happen

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,760
because um you have to take

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
into account different time zones around

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,640
the world

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,400
when when we go we went with depconf all

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,200
around the world but

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,320
for the most of the time we just where

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,159
in the us

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,520
and in europe and the schedules

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,960
somehow were also mostly aligned

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,080
to to make it to accommodate it

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,280
for europeans and americans when

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,679
when it's uh on in the other

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,000
parts so to see but with

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,000
two years ago when we were in taiwan

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,840
which was our first conference

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,840
in in asia

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,760
it it had a completely different

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,320
schedule

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,159
and and made it possible for for other

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,559
people to join in that

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,000
this is one also one of the biggest

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,080
aspects why

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,840
we move every year with the demon

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,720
conference to a different

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
world so that people who are locally

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,600
there

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,960
are able to attend the conference

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,880
and not just have it like where most

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,200
people are located because

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,279
when you just do it where most people

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,559
are then you will create

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,559
a more density in the area where you

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,840
already have a lot of people

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:56,720
we need to go to places um

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,880
to to make to create the momentum and

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,159
to to make it possible for others to

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,600
join

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,880
and this is a very

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,919
for for me this is one of the biggest

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,600
uh possibilities that depconf

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,200
have has with creating the conferences

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,880
all around the globe

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,400
and and with the improvement

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,679
on minitab coms i think we are

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,880
even getting better here um

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,080
to to have like smaller deviant

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,320
conferences

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:37,279
but also more local in in the areas

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,120
like for instance if you take last

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,279
year's steering conference in

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:48,159
kojita they had many conferences

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:51,760
before where they sort of

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:56,080
enrolled so to say the people to create

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:59,200
the regular yearly depconf there

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,720
and i think

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,279
having small conferences

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,880
throughout the year in different areas

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,279
of the world

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,279
would create this possibility

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,799
to to strengthen the local communities

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,440
around

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,600
the world um

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,880
what you said about the chennai

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,279
diversity

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:34,000
i'm not completely sure if i followed

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:37,360
that in in as a whole

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,360
but um

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,320
i can you maybe um

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,240
just add a sentence or two on that what

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,200
what you meant with respect to that

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,520
is it's better in india in that regards

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
um

00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,640
like we have more than 50 percent of

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,760
engineering students are women but

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,840
they don't have the kind of freedom

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,440
or what you call the

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,360
freedom or and they have a lot of

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,799
restrictions they don't have a proper

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,039
laptop with them

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,960
they have limitations on like they can't

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,240
be online for a long time like

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,679
girls are supposed to be not online and

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,919
those kind of restrictions

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
around them are there they don't have

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,120
the freedom

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,720
but yes we have when you consider the

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,760
number of

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,760
i.t professionals women have

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,039
very good person there are very good

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,279
percentage of women but

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,240
in free software it's really less than

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,279
like not even one person

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
okay yeah

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:53,840
um someone else

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,840
wants to join in in the conversation

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:09,520
yeah please unmute yourself

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:13,440
and andy the floor is yours

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,760
thank you a lot of this would be easier

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,480
if instead of debian diversity we could

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,399
have just debbie and human

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,200
but most of the people don't understand

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,440
what it is to be human

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,880
it's difficult there are things that

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,039
overlap

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:34,000
um each of us is a certain age

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,080
identifies with the gender um there are

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,240
lots of characteristics

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,799
what do we do about people who have

00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:48,000
intersectionality things that overlap

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:51,279
where does that fit in

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,559
um i don't think that you

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:58,120
can run a diversity

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,799
team or effort without thinking of

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,440
intersectionality in the first place

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,120
because

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:09,039
then you create more spaces

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,320
for something specific and uh

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:17,039
if and there's always an

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:20,159
intersection like um

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,799
there is this really uh really really

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,159
great

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:31,279
book uh by a black woman from germany

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:35,279
um titled um

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:39,279
what what germans don't want to hear

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:43,200
about racism but need to hear

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:47,279
and she really speaks about

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,480
this double discrimination

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,640
that she faces as a black

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:59,039
woman and that she can't intersect or

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,360
or pin down if she's now

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,159
belittled because she's a woman or if

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,279
she's belittled because she's black

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,840
or which is more

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,799
the the more likely outcome that she's

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,440
belittled because she's a black woman

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,440
and this this kind of double

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,559
discrimination

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,799
also happens and and i notice it

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:27,279
in so so many lgbt

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:31,360
organizations even here in vienna

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:35,200
where you have queer groups which

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,240
are not seeing the the possibility

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,480
of of what

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:46,000
what they do towards uh people of color

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,520
and they just have their

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,840
wide stereotypical thinking within

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,840
their own community and and when they

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
are

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:04,399
called out or or pointed out

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,080
the resistance they have integrated into

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:11,600
their thinking they they become

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,960
totally um defensive and say yeah but we

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,159
are discriminated

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,799
already we can't discriminate others and

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,399
that's

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,399
just not the way it works um

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,840
so yes intersectionality

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,880
is a core value of

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,679
every diversity effort and inclusion

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:39,760
effort that lives up to its name

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,480
and i can understand when you say yeah

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,520
we are all

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,039
humans but

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,480
not all humans have it

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:54,000
bad and and have have

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,519
a disadvantage in this society

00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,760
um i as a trans person

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,320
am discriminated every time i go to a

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,519
toilet

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,960
a cis person can go to a toilet

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:12,000
without even thinking about it

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,960
if i end up in the men's toilet i

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,760
get weird looks and shouted against if i

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,120
end up in a

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,720
women's toilet the same happens and

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,080
and things like that so

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:30,000
to create uh to to put the focus

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,279
on diversity and increasing visibility

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,120
and and possibilities to to sustain

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:40,240
in this society for marginalized

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,000
groups and and people

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,960
um is a must before we can

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
say okay we are all humans because when

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,799
we

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:54,399
say we are humans uh

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:58,159
we we often say okay i don't

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,279
care for your problems struggles in this

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,960
society

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,480
but the society is um

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,200
really it's a systematic part

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,799
and we should make sure that we are not

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,360
uh

00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,399
reproducing the systematic

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,679
discrimination within the divine

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,279
community

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,480
and that's why i see really

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,960
also the need for for having a diversity

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
effort

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,440
sure that's what i meant in some ways

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,039
when i say debian humans i mean really

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,960
well-behaved humans

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,039
that understand that everybody else is a

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,880
human being needs respect

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,159
and that kind of thing we don't always

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,279
live up to that

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,799
yeah i i

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,200
i totally see a point and and understand

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,480
what

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,240
what you aim at and

00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,720
when when i think back to

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:04,080
um stepconf in in

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,200
in montreal like where i

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,640
think that was the last time

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,640
that i saw swen

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,240
and he's a person in wheelchair and he

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,440
he wasn't really able to properly

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,519
attend uh the talks because

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,720
um the auditorium made it difficult for

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,320
him to get

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,760
um to the front and and be

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,840
more directly part of the discussion

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,240
i'm i i don't want to call out specific

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,470
um depcon for orga teams here

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,679
but the inclusion

00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,640
[Music]

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,760
is something that really has to be

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,200
thought through

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:57,360
and at some point i

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,240
i i really i was kind of disappointed to

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,840
have

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,039
heard this statement but someone

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,159
really said yeah i'm

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,639
kinda glad that octavio is not attending

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,359
that conf anymore he's

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,159
he's in a real in in an electric

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,280
wheelchair

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,960
which is locatically kind of a

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,560
difficulty

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,679
but if you only go to venues and

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,240
make it possible for for people to

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,440
attend and only accommodate

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,280
when you know that that someone might

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,560
have difficulties

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,599
to attend and not

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,119
create this space from

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,560
from roots on to be inclusive

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,679
and and be able for people to attend

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:53,839
without them having to think

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,399
of um yeah may i be able to

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,960
to sit in the auditorium and watch the

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,320
talks or do i have to be in my room and

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,359
watch it from

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:08,160
from the laptop um

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:11,359
so we can really improve on the

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,359
on the in inclusion uh parts

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:18,640
in in that regards and um

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:23,599
and i know it's it's it's kind of

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,599
difficult in a lot of spaces um

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:32,160
but then we really should clearly

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,280
also mark it out in faqs and

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,480
and make it clear and put it there

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,160
that there were difficulties to to get a

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,680
better accessible

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:48,000
place and what the what the

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:52,000
issues are there and try to find

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,440
uh creative ways to to work around it

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,440
because we're

00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,640
a community of geeks if we can't make

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,480
something and and find solutions to

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,920
to difficult problems like in

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,960
heidelberg we were laying out the

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,480
the internet cable for

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,720
for the dorm which held the conference

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,200
throughout the zoo and

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,960
to be able to have proper internet on

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:27,839
premise

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,839
so there is possibilities to do that

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,560
someone else would want to

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
talk

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,960
um yeah

00:36:50,960 --> 00:37:00,000
i hope i don't pronounce

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:04,000
the name wrongly um paulo

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
asked on isc

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:12,480
about color diversity um

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,200
what might be at years why we have so

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,640
many

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,320
uh so little um yeah i

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,119
picked up his typo on irc um why we have

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,560
so

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:29,520
little black and brown people

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,520
with within the debian community

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,119
we are still mostly a white club

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,320
so to say even though we have some some

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:45,040
sort of geo diversity which we

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:51,280
definitely can improve on um

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:54,560
but even then it might be

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:58,480
i don't know is there

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,480
some something that

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,200
plays into having mostly

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,400
white people within the deviant

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,520
community

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,720
one one thing that i might think of

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,680
plays into it

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,599
that you have to have access to a

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,800
computer and and

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,320
to proper internet and that

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,839
sort of plays often into

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
classicism and and everything that comes

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,480
with that

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,680
and that often also plays into

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:38,079
a racial imbalance um

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:42,160
but uh leslie um you raised your hand

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,680
so one of the issues um is often time

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,880
um we have it's and it's not always

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,640
considered

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,560
that um and again it it plays into this

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,400
the the classes and stuff that you you

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,640
just mentioned but

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,240
in order to have time in order to be

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,920
able to volunteer

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,160
to do things you have to have time

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,119
and you have to have sufficient funds

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,160
that will cover

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,560
that time um so that you don't need to

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,760
be

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,400
using that timing to do something else

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,920
um i just wanted to pick up on a couple

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,359
of other points that had come up

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,920
uh intersectionality uh something i

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,520
discussed

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,440
earlier in the week with my feminist

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,119
theory group you can't actually

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,440
tear apart um the various

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,920
identities within an intersectional

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,280
identity it is it is a whole

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,839
um it's a very messy hole but it is a

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,160
whole

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:44,079
and um much uh a as um

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,480
uh saying um yeah if you are

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,839
a black woman you're you will be

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,560
discriminated because you're black

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,480
because you're

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,599
a woman but also because you're a black

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,079
woman and it's

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,880
almost impossible to tell at any time

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,960
whether

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,400
the discrimination is one or the of the

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,000
other or the other

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:07,280
um what else um

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,720
yeah we struggle we are a microcosm

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,960
within the various societies we live in

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,280
and so we're always going to struggle

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,560
with the fact that the external forces

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,079
acting on the people within the group

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,640
are going to bring their own problems

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,280
with them

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,319
so if there are already discriminations

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,160
outside

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,440
that's going to come into debian what we

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,640
need to find is ways

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,760
of making of

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,640
uh mitigating those as far as we can

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,079
um and certainly with um the inclusivity

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,800
problems that we've seen

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,560
at webcomps one of the ideas that that

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,599
comes to mind is that possibly we need

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,560
to have

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,560
just um

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,280
some sort of of document or

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,119
something that just sets out these are

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,920
the things you might want to consider

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,359
and if you can't consider those please

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,119
make it very clear

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:09,119
that you have at least tried to um

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,720
so that uh it doesn't if because

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,400
one of the problems is if you if you

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,240
don't fall into

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,520
one of these discriminated groups one of

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,560
these minority groups one of these

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,000
marginalized groups

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,040
you often don't even see the problem

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,920
so it sometimes just helps have a much

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,359
as i hate the idea of a checklist

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,480
it's nice it is just okay useful for

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,000
particularly for organizations to be

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,200
able to go

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,960
have we thought of everything yet um

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,240
so that may be something that we can

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,280
possibly uh

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:47,040
feed into uh the process

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,160
by either suggesting that uh that auger

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,560
teams come to us

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,839
and ask hey have we considered

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,280
everything we need to

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,920
or as i say just by providing a living

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,920
document

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,680
saying these are the things that you

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,720
might want to consider

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,920
because we know there are that they come

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,079
up as a problem

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,560
um and um if you don't consider them

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,520
uh or if you aren't able to do anything

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,760
about them

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,040
then it's important to let people know

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,400
so that they have a

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,079
an understanding of what they're getting

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,119
into

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,119
and i think i'll stop there

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,720
andy you raised your hand do you want to

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,720
add a few

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:35,119
points

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,119
um you're still muted

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,000
no that was in error i don't need to add

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,000
any more ah okay

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,079
good

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:53,040
um one thought was going through my head

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:56,079
when leslie talked about it and i

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,839
um yeah the the thing of um

00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,839
if if you have to

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:07,280
if you have to uh think about how

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:11,599
you get into the next week and and how

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:14,000
you get your food

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,200
you get to your food and have to care

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,560
for your children

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,599
which is also still the

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,560
the systematic oppression that that

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,520
leads to

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,720
to the reason why there's little women

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,960
in in the tech

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,960
community because often they are

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:40,000
like the most most of the

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,440
care work within families is put on

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,880
on the women's shoulders uh if there are

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,880
kids involved if they are

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,800
anything a household horde involved even

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,560
if

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,640
if it's just a heterosexual couple

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,599
men and women living together without

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,880
kids

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:04,160
the the care for a household is is

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,359
usually also not very evenly

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:11,040
distributed and and all these things

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:13,599
leads to two less women within the tech

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,520
community too even though they are

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,880
interested because they have

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,160
less time to invest it and the same

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,280
goes then for for people in precarious

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,280
situation

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,480
so of course to some degree the giving

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,240
community

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:36,480
has has a lot of academic background

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:39,760
and that plays in into the demographics

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,040
so the way to move

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,319
forward might be to to find ways

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,880
to to support people

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:55,440
to to find more time for them and and

00:44:50,880 --> 00:45:00,000
sort of also um

00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:04,079
through scholarships outreachy which we

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,200
had been using and and all of this

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,560
um ah yeah now i

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,680
i remembered my thought from before um

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,319
in the previous talk i

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,880
was speaking about the fetiverse and and

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,520
uh

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,040
a really great uh black community i'm

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,119
following there

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,119
and it

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,640
even so uh people highly praise the

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:36,640
fathers of being so grateful and and

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,760
and increasing diversity it

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,079
it still is a reflection of the society

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,560
and

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,280
and through that you still have a lot of

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,720
white

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,920
racist people uh cis people

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,040
on on the fetiverse 2 even though it

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,720
has great communities and great diverse

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,839
communities

00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,359
within certain servers or

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:05,280
areas within the vetivers

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:08,160
so yes everything is sort of reflecting

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,520
for the society so we really have to

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,480
work on the society

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,680
to improve here but that doesn't mean

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,480
that we can't still try to

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,400
improve it on within the diving

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,200
community

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:28,400
so um i think that might be

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,800
a useful final words

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:36,160
unless someone wants to have a last day

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,440
um i think yeah chatan raised

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,440
his hand

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,280
yes just a thanks to everybody to attend
