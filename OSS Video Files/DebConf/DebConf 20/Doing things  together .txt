Our thoughts about cooperation aspects of doing things together.

Sometimes in Debian we do work together with others, and sometimes we are a number of people who work alone, and happen to all upload their work in the same place.

In times when we have needed to take important decisions together, this distinction has become crucial, and some of us might have found that we were not as good at cooperation as we would have thought.

This talk is intended for everyone who is part of a larger community. We will show concepts and tools that we think could help understand and shape cooperation.

hello and welcome to our talk doing

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
things together

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,280
i'm enrico i'm ulrike and uh a lot of

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,160
this talk grew from conversation that

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,359
we've had

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,520
so we're doing this together

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,560
carl marchepola was an italian economic

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,439
historian

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,599
and in 1976 he wrote an essay called the

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,560
basic laws of human stupidity

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,080
and the essay in contains a graph that i

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
find an interesting way to look at

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,079
people's behavior

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
the graph is two axis in the horizontal

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,440
one it goes

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,239
from losses to others to benefits to

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,719
others

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,440
and the vertical one goes from losses to

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,480
oneself to benefit to oneself

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,719
and when you have benefit to yourself

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,840
and benefit to others

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
it's the quadrant of what polar cause

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,719
intelligent people

00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,320
when it's benefit to oneself

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,160
but losses to others it's the quadrant

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,439
that chipola caused bandits

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,760
whereas when you lose

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,000
yourself and you benefit to others it's

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,400
the helpless quadrant and

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
losses to oneself and losses to others

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,240
is the stupid quadrant

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
and the origin of the graphs where

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,880
there's neither benefit nor

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,040
losses it's ineffectual people and

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,159
i find it an interesting way to look at

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
people's behavior

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,600
i mean i'm looking at behavior i'm not

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,079
looking at people

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
people in different times behave

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
intelligently stupidly

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
and all sorts of things depending on

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,240
situations and

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
everything um but like take for example

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
face masks

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,360
and you wear them in indoor public

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,720
spaces it's a bit inconvenient but it

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,680
prevents spreading

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,280
of it to others and helps them limit the

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,040
spread of the pandemic which is

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,000
kind of what one wants so i think

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
wearing a mask still like among others

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
still

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,759
is on somewhere on the benefit to

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,600
oneself

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,119
and definitely it's on the benefit to

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,719
others so one would say it's an

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,280
intelligent thing to do

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,319
and not wearing a mask especially in

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,399
public cause

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,400
losses to others and a bit of a loss to

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,879
oneself so we're going

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
in between the bandits and quite a bit

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,120
towards

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,560
stupid but unfortunately when i go out

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
at the moment

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,920
even though the cases of covet are

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,280
increasing where i am

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,280
uh people still don't wear masks which

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
brings to chipotle's fundamental law of

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,959
stupidity number five

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,599
which says a stupid person is the most

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,720
dangerous kind of person

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,920
but besides analogues with

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,840
face masks and jokes and something uh i

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
found that chipola's graph is something

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
common with another graph i used in my

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
talk in depth com17

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
which is the thomas kilmann conflict

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
styles graph

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
and the vertical axis is the same it

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,400
goes from

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
loss to oneself to benefit to oneself

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
while the horizontal axis is different

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
it's not about benefit or losses to

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
others it's about

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,680
investing or not investing in the

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,280
relationship

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,959
and this idea of investing in the

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
relationship i find it kind of

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,599
interesting

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,640
especially it reminds me of

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,319
the iterated prisoner dilemma

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,920
there's a nice game online the the zero

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
in the slide and there will be in the

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,040
slide notes you can go and play

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,480
basically if you deal with a person once

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,360
you don't care about

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,440
building a relationship with them like

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
if you run a tourist wrap business you

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,879
know

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,879
that the people from every corner of the

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
world that come and have an ice cream in

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,040
your ice cream shop in venice they are

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,720
not coming back they're there that day

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
and the next day they'll be in pisa

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
taking a photo with the

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,599
with the leaning tower so you don't

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,159
really care about

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,599
giving them the right change or giving

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,000
them

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,200
a nice amount of ice cream and so on you

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
just maximize your amount of money

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
whereas if you work with someone over a

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,519
long time

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,959
you do want to focus on the relationship

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,120
so the idea of the

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
prisoner dilemma is that if you run the

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
game once

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
it pays if you cheat uh it is the

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
rational thing to do but

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,959
if you play with the same people

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
multiple times you need to build a

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,000
relationship you need to build trust to

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,960
actually maximize the outcomes

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
there's a beautiful talk a ted talk by

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,360
franz de val

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,400
that shows various ways in which this

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,000
also

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,280
goes on beyond humans and that will also

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,919
be in the talk notes

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,960
so this prisoner's dilemma iterated

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,360
prisoner dilemma

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,680
is i find it quite relevant to the idea

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,800
of building on the relationship

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,600
and i want to make it clear that

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
two graphs are not the same it we are

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,479
talking about three different axes

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
i don't want to imply that by putting

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,800
the graph side by side

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,280
that everybody who competes is bandit

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
and everybody who cooperates is

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,280
intelligent and everybody who

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,199
compromises in effect is ineffectual

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,120
and everybody who doesn't care is stupid

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
or something sometimes it happens but

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,039
it's

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,720
not the point of the graph the point is

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,880
to show three different

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,240
important aspects of collaboration

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
benefit to oneself

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
benefit to others and maintaining a

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,039
healthy relationship

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,880
three distinct axes for example there

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,960
can be intelligent behavior that does

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,680
not focus at all in the relationship

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,600
like when upstream makes a new version

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
which has fancy new feature that nobody

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,919
asked for

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,759
but still they benefited themselves

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,000
because clearly they care about those

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:51,919
and we'll get some new features so

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,240
there is some benefit to us but maybe

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,160
the

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,479
that one nasty bugger the fact that

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,360
everybody still hasn't been fixed

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,280
so that's something that benefits to

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,919
upstream benefits to the user but

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
doesn't

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,240
build much of a relationship with the

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,039
users or

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,280
if somebody offers you a deal that you

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,520
cannot refuse

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,560
it may be beneficial to both and yet you

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,039
feel uneasy

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,960
you lost agency it's all very

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,759
intelligent and it could be wise to

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,080
limit dealings with that person

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,240
or we could all get very stupidly drunk

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,400
and trust the house and end up hurt and

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,400
regretting every moment

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,319
with a big loss to oneself and a big

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
loss to the all the others that are with

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
us and yet

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
we may all end up much closer friends

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,039
than we were before so it was all been

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
blatantly stupid

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,400
and with a lot of benefit to the

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,639
relationship

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,880
i do not suggest that this could be a

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,199
good way to build a relationship

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,639
competition instead is what we grow up

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
in most societies

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,520
you got competitive games best mark in

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,080
the class top 10 music charts podium at

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,560
every sport event

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
at least where i come from we studied

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,639
history based on

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,479
wars who won who lost who got their

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,360
enemies killed first

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,039
la la la in competition you don't get

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
what you if you don't get what you want

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,240
you

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,680
escalate you put in more energy you

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,039
fight harder

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,520
you face down your opponent society has

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,759
a twisted perception of success

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,680
if you are a seller and you can get

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,680
anyone to buy your stuff at the price

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,400
you want they say you're a good seller

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,960
i say you are a scammer if you are

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,720
dating and you can get a person to

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
come to bed with you when whether they

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
like it or not they say you're a good

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,440
lover i say you are an abuser

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
sometimes however competition is easier

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,599
if you're getting what you need

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
why should you care what others are or

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,120
aren't getting

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
if you are getting what you need anyway

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
why should you

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,160
invest energy in growing a healthy

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,520
relationship

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,319
and i this kind of feels like privilege

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,720
doesn't it you are getting what you want

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,840
anyway you can forget

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,520
that the others should get something you

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
can forget

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,560
in about having a good relationship with

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
others

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,520
why do you need to bother you are

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,960
getting what you want anyway

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,520
why aren't we all high in the benefit to

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,800
ourselves

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,280
quadrant what makes us stupid helpless

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,560
avoidant accommodating and effectual

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,120
compromising we are all different that

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,159
way

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,479
we all have some aspects of

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,839
our characters that make us go somehow

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,159
away from the top maximum rational thing

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,720
we can possibly do

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
so different people do different things

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
differently

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,640
i would like to introduce a concept that

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,640
i learned about in the mediation

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,560
training i'm currently following

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,560
which is called the drivers

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,600
the psychologist tybee kala has

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
identified common patterns of what

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
motivates us

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,880
and he calls those our drivers

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,519
we learn in early childhood to conform

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,800
our behavior to the expectations

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,519
of the adults around us our parents our

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,279
teachers

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,480
or other attachment figures if parents

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,120
never allowed our child selves to cry

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
or if they do not listen to our needs we

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
might construct the inner belief that we

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,120
need to be strong and that we can never

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,080
ask for help

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
when we face stress or need to solve

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
problems

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,200
as adults we rely on these unconscious

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,399
scripts that we learned in childhood

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,000
drivers as identified by color are not

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,880
personality types

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
they are simply inner dynamics a bit

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
like super powers

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
they bring positive aspects and negative

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
aspects

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,360
they can be more or less pronounced at

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
different times

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,600
in general they become difficult

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,560
or problematic in times of stress

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,040
so there are five drivers like in

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,160
dungeons and dragons each driver comes

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,360
with its powers

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,079
and weaknesses the five drivers are

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,200
be perfect that would correspond to the

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,000
wizard

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,120
be strong that would correspond to the

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,920
fighter

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,040
hurry up that would correspond to the

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,279
rogue

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,399
please others which would correspond to

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,320
the bard and

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,399
try that corresponds to the paladin

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,480
you can find tests and questionnaires on

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,720
the internet to test which driver

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
or which drivers are the ones that drive

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,240
you

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,440
i'm going to introduce these drivers a

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,920
bit now

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,640
starting with be perfect so the

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,360
imperative of people with this driver is

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,640
i must be perfect wonderful and correct

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,920
i must succeed

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,000
i must win people with this driver work

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,720
accurately and know well how to organize

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,560
work in stress situations however they

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,720
cannot set priorities

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,760
and when everything needs to be perfect

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,519
there's generally

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,519
no good enough as an example

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,440
i could go to someone with this driver

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,920
and say hey i would like to help with

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,279
task

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,279
x and then this person would reply okay

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,360
here's a list of requirements and then i

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,399
get an endless list

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,800
if i'm not discouraged by then then i

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,880
can start working on the task and

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,880
then i will get back another endless

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,800
list of reviewer nitpicks

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,160
making me feel like i'm really not good

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
enough

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,640
what we see in debian really often is

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,640
that people try to make incremental

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
improvement proposals to something

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
which get blocked for the reason of not

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
being perfect

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,000
or leaving out some obscure corner case

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
the police others driver has the

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,600
imperative

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,079
i must make other people happy and proud

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,120
of me only others can validate my work

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,639
and if they don't

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,040
i failed people with this driver

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,760
are generally the social glue in a group

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
and truly interested in cooperation

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,200
but on the negative side of things they

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
have a hard time saying no

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,320
and a hard time protecting their

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
boundaries

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,560
as an example on monday we need to hold

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,320
the webinar on the shiny

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,240
big blue button server that i just

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
installed the coordinator was on

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,680
vacation

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,600
and created the accounts only on friday

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,279
she notices there are issues with some

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
accounts and writes me an email

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,120
we really need to do this today

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,160
otherwise we are in a deep mess on

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
monday

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
i think well i have a full work day

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,200
today and tomorrow is weekend

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,279
i have set up everything two weeks ago

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,000
but i feel responsible for others and

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,079
suddenly

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,959
with the police others driver i

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,279
compromise and i put this thing first

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,360
going over my own priorities and my own

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,760
boundaries which causes me stress and

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,480
anger and takes away the weekend that i

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,760
needed to relax

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,480
to be strong driver has the imperative

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,600
i must not show weakness i cannot ask

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
for help

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,160
people with this driver are reliable and

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,760
steady not easily moved

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,600
but they never show feelings and they

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
never ask for help

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,639
in debian b strong's are the

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,040
professional yak shavers

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,680
yak shaving is an apparently unrelated

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,399
activity

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,160
needed to solve a larger problem for

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,440
example they might see that some code

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,639
does not compile

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,320
trace down a bug in the code fix it then

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,560
find a bug in the compiler

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,079
search for the bug on the compiler fix

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,200
that and when their code finally

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,040
compiles

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,560
they have a bug to track down in a

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,000
library they use

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,920
at this point they have spent a

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,680
frustrating week on a task it was

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,199
supposed to take four hours

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,519
after which they could have asked for

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,399
help and eventually have found a rubber

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,480
duck

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,880
someone to explain the problem to

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
hitting on the solution in the process

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,639
or they could have found a different

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,079
workaround

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,880
the try-hard driver has the imperative

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,880
that i cannot refuse requests i must

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,120
always try my best

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
people with this driver are enthusiastic

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,519
attentive and tenacious

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
they volunteer for many projects and

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
they

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,680
tend unfortunately to turn small tasks

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
into major

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,920
projects they are very hard on

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,920
themselves and others

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,680
they are the people who start a project

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,600
and when it starts to work they move

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
over to another one for another problem

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,880
that needs solving

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,360
and the last driver is hurry up the

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,079
imperative of people with this driver is

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,399
so much to do so little time they are

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,320
very fast at grasping and understanding

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
problems they work fast

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,519
but when they do that they make a lot of

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
small mistakes then they run from

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,240
meeting to meeting or from job to job

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,000
they're late in the meeting they're like

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
oh my god i have to run to the next

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
meeting

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,040
so they're quite impatient and they

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
appear as always busy

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,959
they're the people who maintain 5000

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,959
packages but have a hard time answering

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,959
bug reports and fixing root causes

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,680
now it is probable that you might find

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,480
out that you have not only one strong

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,519
driver but

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,440
two or even three as an example the be

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,519
perfect and the please others drivers

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,079
seem to often go together

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,199
if you find this think about how these

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,399
two might influence

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,000
each other how a request to do work on

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,000
the weekend and your desire

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to do this work perfectly might drive

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,199
you into accepting unacceptable

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,040
conditions

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,480
and how this creates stress and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,480
contributes to burnout

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,480
so cooperation may be hard when people

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,399
with specific drivers work together

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,199
for example when a person with a hurry

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,360
up driver has to work with a be perfect

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,880
there are quite naturally conflicting

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,720
expectations

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,079
and therefore having these two work

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,399
together can create a lot of conflict

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,160
the same goes for the combination try

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,079
hard and be perfect

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,079
the tryhard constantly starts new

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,360
projects but to be perfect wants to plan

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,839
a project in detail

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,839
before even starting to work on it

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,759
now you might say okay well then i'll do

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,800
the exact contrary from now on

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,320
and you might want to find yourself an

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,519
anti-driver

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,160
however turning to the contrary behavior

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,240
the anti-driver will not fundamentally

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,639
change how we work together

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,320
when you go from be perfect to its

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,120
anti-driver i don't care

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
you're still obsessing about perfection

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
this

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,800
is because driver and anti-driver are

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,199
actually two sides of the same metal

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,480
so the be strong driver obsesses about

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,040
distance

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,839
hurry up and its anti-driver don't rush

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,959
me both

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,199
obsess about time awareness please

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,560
others and its auntie driver i don't

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,680
care about you

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,800
obsess about empathy and try hearts

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,839
auntie driver

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:07,600
there i fixed it obsess about stamina

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,959
so we're flawed we apparently are

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,120
so what do we do with this information

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,199
well i think it's really good to be

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,000
aware of one's own drivers and to

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,120
identify

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,919
one's behaviors and patterns in

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,520
particular

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,919
patterns that repeat themselves

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,039
we can then try to think about how our

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,240
drivers manifest

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:34,000
and how they interact or how they even

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,000
exacerbate each other we can find out

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,440
how they contribute to stress

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,240
and how they might even fuel burnout

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,679
and the second step in a team or in an

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,520
organization can be to

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,520
actually set up guidelines for

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,280
successful cooperation

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,440
so that we don't run into the same

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,640
problems related to drivers over and

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,679
over again

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,679
for example one could define

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,000
what is needed to start a new project

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,360
while still allowing all the tryhards to

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,160
experiment and make lots of prototypes

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,919
or one can set up coding guidelines and

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,760
githubs in order to avoid a clash

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,919
between the be perfect and to hurry up

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,480
who makes mistakes

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,559
guidelines for respecting people's

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,720
weekends and evenings in different time

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,799
zones can help protecting the boundaries

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,440
of the people-pleasers

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,600
one can set up regular checks to see if

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
expectations to solve an issue need to

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,039
be readjusted

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,360
in order to avoid the be strongs to be

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,480
stuck for too long by themselves

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,480
in summary we asked what happens when

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
you run out of energy

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,440
well that depends on what are your

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,919
drivers and ingrained patterns

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,520
we are a community of people with all

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,720
sorts of different drivers and

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,320
motivations

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,400
which sometimes get into conflict

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,720
and that brings us to the next topic

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,480
which is conflict

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,440
we live in a society in which

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,960
disagreement disapproval and disharmony

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,200
are frowned upon

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,080
but disagreement disapproval and

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,960
disharmony

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,039
are inevitable we can see them as being

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,440
the fuel for change

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,120
after all disagreement and disapproval

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,080
brought us paid vacation

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,520
women's right to vote and other societal

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,640
changes

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,280
if we do not acknowledge the three d's

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,799
a situation of disagreement disapproval

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,240
or disharmony

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
can turn into conflict

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,880
now the most important thing to know

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,880
about conflict is that conflicts happen

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
if you're having conflicts it does not

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,840
mean that you're a bad person

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,200
or that you are not perfect conflict

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,000
is like an alarm and a monitoring tool

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,440
generally when we see that alarm we want

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
to understand

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,360
we want to understand conflict and

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
turned into a bug report that we can act

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,919
upon

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,320
thereby we acknowledge its existence

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,080
now let's not get confused by the use of

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,000
the word conflict we're not talking

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,080
about nuclear conflicts here

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,919
conflict doesn't mean that one person

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,600
shouts the loudest and the longest and

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,039
escalates everything until they get

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,720
exactly what they want

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,039
the way they want it a conflict

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,919
that can be turned from an alarm into a

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,960
bug report

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,960
is the first part of a solution if we

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,799
don't acknowledge conflict

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,799
we don't allow solutions

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,480
not acknowledging conflict avoiding it

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,919
can be a tentative to maintain or

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
restore harmony

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,320
or attentive to end an already existing

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,200
conflict

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,679
avoiding means changing the subject

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,320
delaying a discussion indefinitely

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,480
avoiding a person altogether or not

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,440
bringing up the subject of contention at

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,159
all when trying to avoid conflict some

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,600
people stay

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,720
silent and that is their means

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,640
to end conflict however

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,200
the effect of the silence can actually

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,440
be to escalate the conflict

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,440
by denying the other party the right to

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,640
be heard to be acknowledged

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,320
to receive feedback or validation using

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,640
the thomas kilmann graph

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,440
that we've seen earlier conflict

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,840
avoidance

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,400
actually creates a lose-lose situation

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,240
so here's an example of conflict

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,440
avoidance meeting perfectionism in

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,600
debian

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,600
say there's a problem to solve and the

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,720
perfectionists are battling into the

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,120
death

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
the place others try to assume good

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,039
intentions

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,440
and excuse people's losses of temper

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,200
the be strongs are busy debugging their

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,360
hard tool chain issues

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
they try hearts get ideas for fixing and

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,240
related problems and go making

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,880
prototypes

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
the hurry ups get bored and go read 25

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,559
other main english threads submit eight

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,400
patches get five rejected try to fix

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,720
them and suddenly six more

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,919
eventually everyone has retreated from

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,120
the fight saying

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,720
whatever do it your way except one who

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,480
gets to have it their way

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,400
in all this benefit to others is

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,440
incidental and there is a loss in the

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,600
relationship

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,440
and this gives us acceptance through

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,559
attrition rather than through consensus

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,080
and another thing that's common

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,440
in free software projects it's is

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,799
structuring as a founders and helpers

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,520
kind of thing where somebody started the

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,480
project

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,039
and became naturally the leader of it

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,880
because

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,640
well they were the only person working

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,640
on it and then

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,400
somehow there's a little community

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,919
around it starts to grow with people

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,960
sending patches

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,400
kind of trying to help this development

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,880
and it gets to what we

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
sometimes see like benevolent dictator

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,240
for life kind of structure

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,039
so if you look at the the thomas kilmann

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,919
graph

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,640
the leader will probably be up on the

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,760
benefit to oneself thing often and

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,039
also benefit to others if they are

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,240
intelligent

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,280
um no necessary benefit to the

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,039
relationship

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,880
is kind of irrelevant at this point

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,520
because we have a person working alone

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
when people start contributing they will

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,320
probably be

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,679
reasonably low in the benefit to

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,799
themselves a little bit

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,080
yes because well otherwise why they're

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,679
there but

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,600
there will probably be a lot of

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,480
compromise a lot of accommodation

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,120
because well

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,080
they are on somebody else's turf and

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,400
maybe

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,440
they will try to do something benefit to

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,360
the relationship

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,520
to try to feel part of the developers of

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,240
this project somehow

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,080
and this is not inherently bad for many

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,200
small kind of projects this may be all

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
that needed

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,880
you will have focus because you have a

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,279
person who has the vision

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,279
the long-term vision about things and

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,600
gets some help so it's a bit better than

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,279
the person alone

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,960
but this does not scale beyond the

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,520
capacity of

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,640
the the rockstar leader thing to

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,600
exercise

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,000
control over the community tell people

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,360
always what to do and how to do it

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,720
and you know vetting the choices say no

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,720
you don't want to do that because then

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,480
you break that thing that only i know

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,039
that i want to do in the future do it

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,679
the other way instead that sort of thing

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,440
another issue is the projects get

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,120
identified with the leaders and they're

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,919
limited by the limits

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,360
of the leaders for example for software

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,440
foundation i think it used to be a

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,279
community of people helping stallman

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,799
and the linux kernel mainly list a

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,760
community of people helping leno

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,279
storewalls

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,440
but at some point the limits of the

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,559
founders became the limits of the whole

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,039
community or

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,679
or the community grew to a point where

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,520
it the the limit of the founders were

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,640
too much of a constraint

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,159
and it became a problem if you find

00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,960
yourself at the center of a group of

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,720
people

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,279
who even if they are long-term

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,200
developers are there to help you

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,039
ask you all the questions ask you for

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,240
direction all the time you might be in

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,039
this situation

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,480
and maybe you don't want to be in that

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,520
situation

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,279
maybe the project wants to scale and for

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,520
example i haven't heard people having

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,600
obvious problems with my personality but

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,240
i find myself in various degrees in such

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,840
a position

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,880
on nmw contributors depending on depth

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,960
debian org and those projects are

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,279
limited by my personal limits

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,240
and it could be insecurity lack of time

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,240
lack of focus

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
personal likes or dislikes and personal

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,880
priorities

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,679
but i'm sometimes afraid that i am a

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,559
limit to

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,159
how those projects could scale and

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,360
sometimes the project may want to grow a

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,240
community

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,799
and not be like not have a bus factor of

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
one

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,120
i don't want to be in the way of others

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,039
who might want to be part of an

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,840
m or contributors or that tax

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,480
development and its growth

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,480
and if i keep a strong leadership if

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,679
everything is identified with me

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,720
and my sense of direction only people

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,360
who could be

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,159
other drivers in the development of

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,120
these projects

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,880
are driven away it could also be that

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,080
the project has a critical place in a

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,440
community

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,400
for example nm de benori is a critical

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,919
place in debian

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,559
and i don't want that my ideas about how

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,919
an mw

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,760
hawk should look like be the only way

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:36,400
of joining debian there's also sometimes

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,919
some kind of political interests

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,600
interest

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,039
or social interest in taking a project

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,000
beyond a leader

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,799
and helpers kind of thing towards

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,480
something that is a bit more

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,679
community driven or has a

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,080
broader kind of leadership

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,679
you can try to turn this situation into

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,559
a situation where more people are in

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,880
charge of things

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,360
and you can try as the person who

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,640
has know how you can try to help the

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,760
people

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,039
instead of direct them like help like

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,080
give them what they need

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,039
not give them guidance tell them what to

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,520
do

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,919
but give them the information they need

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,600
to do what it is that they want to do

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,600
although getting help and onboarding

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,880
people has a risk of turning you

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,760
into a kind of project manager person

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,000
or human resources person which might or

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,840
may not be what you want

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,039
and this could be the peter principle

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,600
where

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,360
you raise to your maximum level of

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,840
incompetence and then

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,760
you get stuck there because maybe you

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,720
are in for development and then you

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,600
become

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,559
a human resources person and you do that

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,360
really badly

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,799
and you lose motivation because it's not

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,960
really your goal

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,880
and then you're stuck in into something

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,440
that doesn't really work for you

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,960
maybe you may try encouraging others not

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,000
just to help technically

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,320
but to lead or manage

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,799
and be mindful of the things that you

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,240
feel that you are comfortable doing and

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,640
be conscious that some

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,399
other things don't work for you

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,159
unfortunately i think that we lack

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,440
narratives and models for growing

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,559
projects beyond

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,520
this kind of bdfl structure

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,880
leader structure thing and i would like

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,640
to see more

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,320
in debian we've often talked about

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,080
imposter syndrome

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,480
and there's a lot of excellent

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,480
people in debian and one doesn't always

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,039
feel as perfect as everybody else seems

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,279
to be

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,640
one doesn't want to get in the way or in

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,440
the party

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
or say something or push a code change

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,200
that

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,520
one might regret and for enough in some

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,440
online projects especially sometimes

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,440
people have been at the end of pretty

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,480
aggressive put downs that will be

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,039
archived by the internet forever

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,760
and i don't want it to happen to me like

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,200
if

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,840
the well respected

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,799
sometimes highly adored person write an

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,960
email saying

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,240
you are really stupid and he goes

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,880
archived online and

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,159
then people find it in search engines

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,039
when you look for a job

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,480
then you know maybe you shouldn't have

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,679
written that mail in the first place

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
even if they were wrong

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,799
but you are the one paying the

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,919
consequence

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,039
i think imposter syndrome also has some

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,840
aspect of

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,000
wanting to invest in the relationship

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,159
before looking at benefit to myself

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,600
to make sure that the relationship is

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,360
safe enough

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,240
for me to participate actively so

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,960
in this kind of imposter syndrome

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,360
situation

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,279
you focus on the relationship you don't

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,360
focus on benefit to yourself you don't

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,320
know yet if you can have that

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,080
if you deserve that so you stay in an

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,880
accommodation

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,919
you win i lose sort of thing and concede

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,960
and try to

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,520
yeah not be in the way so you let others

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,200
work

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,840
you limit the benefit to yourself you

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
don't get acknowledged you don't get

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,480
validated

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,840
if we have a lot of that we are not

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,360
building something together

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,760
some other people are building something

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,760
for some other people and you are trying

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,600
not to get in the way for now

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,440
and it's interesting because this is not

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,840
only happening i think to

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,840
new developers sometimes ago someone

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,039
reported the light dm bug where the

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,440
video wouldn't switch on

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,440
after the lock screen engaged and you

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,240
could kind of get it back if you switch

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,440
to a text console with like ctrl alt f1

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,480
and then back to control at f7 or f8 or

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,279
however

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
the whole and it was interesting because

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,320
i've seen

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,360
many old-time developers including me

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,440
who replied oh

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,440
that's been happening to me too for

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,200
years and i thought it was just a glitch

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
of my hard work i never thought of

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,919
reporting it

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,840
so even people who have been in debian

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,559
for a long time

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
who had a bug that affected them

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,679
multiple times a day

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,399
ended up just shutting up because

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,960
maybe it's just me and i find i find

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,600
that

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,640
very interesting another thing we have a

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,600
lot in debian is

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,840
arguments and it would be nice to have

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,600
conversations instead

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,279
so sometimes um an argument is more like

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,120
a confrontational discussion

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,000
in which we are mostly interested in

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,679
finding out who is right

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,240
and sometimes we have a conversation

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,760
where we build on each other's ideas

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,399
towards an agreement or a shared

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,279
strategy it's kind of interesting that

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,440
we reverse this in our voting system

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,440
like normally a voting system

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,640
is pretty much like a football match

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,960
where

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,000
you play the game and you see who won

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,000
and in debian

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,360
it's interesting because the part of the

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,399
discussion before

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,840
the voting is actually

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,760
a conversation a cooperation thing where

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,279
you try to put things on the ballot

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,919
that build on everybody's ideas

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,799
so yeah the the voting is a voting but

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,760
the the

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,440
for me the what to put on the ballot the

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,000
process to put things on the ballot is

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,640
much more

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
interesting because that that that is a

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,159
moment in which we

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,679
we really do some nice cooperation

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,120
and then how to get from a conversation

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,440
to cooperation

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,880
there is an interesting book called

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,080
getting to yes

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,399
that has a kind of five-step program

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,159
so that they propose a five-step program

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,480
separate the people from the problem

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,799
focus on interest not position invent

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,679
options for mutual gain insist on using

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,080
objective criteria and know your best

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,000
alternative to negotiate an agreement we

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,000
will go through them one by one

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,640
separate the people from the problem so

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,080
people have values cultural backgrounds

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,279
and emotions that vary

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,200
widely and they could help

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,559
or get in the way of building trust and

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,399
understanding

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,480
i could make the mistake of guessing

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,279
your intention based on my own fears for

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,519
example

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,600
and to make a practical example i have

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,240
just posted the debian project about not

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,159
required meeting in person to sign keys

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,640
and i feel like i'm opening up pandora's

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,399
box

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,679
because i'm poking at a decade-long

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,320
established practice

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,760
and the rituals that are almost the

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,799
foundations of

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,000
interactions in debian and

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,159
i'm very afraid of what's going to

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,880
happen in that thread i know i'll have

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,799
to reread replies many times over

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,720
to be able to understand what people are

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,320
actually writing beyond my fear of

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,240
finding a lynchpop in my

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,840
inbox in or in a conversation i could

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,000
give in to the temptation

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,080
of looking for the approval of people

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,880
who are close to me in the project

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,240
and have this get in the way of a

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,399
difficult discussion

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,880
this clearly does not happen in debian

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,840
because there are no kebabs

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,360
and sometimes moods are high and may

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,159
stop paying attention to what you're

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,040
trying to say

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,560
and pay attention only to rebut what

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,359
you're saying

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,599
and you might be right but are you aware

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,480
that grammar doesn't really work the way

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,679
you seem to

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,079
think it does sometimes we have a hard

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,839
time

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,760
understanding what others are trying to

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:29,200
say do you know what i'm trying to say

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,000
so the payoff of all this is that we can

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,240
be conscious

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,359
of being in the process of working both

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,079
on the relationship

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,960
and on the outcomes but without

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,399
confusing the two

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,040
i may be working on the outcome and

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,079
thinking practically about the problem

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,000
and the solution

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,520
and i may be working on the relationship

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,960
trying to smooth

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,119
different cultural positions or

00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,240
misunderstandings

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,960
or ironing out difficulties in the

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,119
language

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,440
if i intermix the two if i think that

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,240
your point that your solution sucks

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,720
because you

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,280
wrote it in a stupid way or something

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,640
that's

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,280
the problem that we should try to avoid

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,000
then focus on interest not on position

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,680
so

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,880
the idea is i understand what you are

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,760
proposing why do you need it

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,000
we may not agree on the strategies that

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,280
are currently on the table but we might

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,480
find that we agree

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,160
on what problems need to be solved

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,160
it helps to keep an open mind to the

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,079
other side of the argument to see beyond

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,400
the strategy

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,280
so there's a problem when you propose to

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
solve it

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,680
without systemd or with systemd i don't

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,640
really want to get into another system

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,560
the discussion

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,599
would you be okay if we looked at the

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,599
problem itself

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,680
try to understand it better and try to

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,160
figure various possible ways of solving

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,599
it

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,200
for example and sometimes this kind

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,599
of kind of reminds me of the x y problem

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,520
so like okay you propose a solution but

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,359
what is your actual problem let's talk

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,800
about that because maybe

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,440
that would there could be other

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,280
solutions or

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,800
what in nonviolent communication is the

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,720
idea of people

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,160
may agree on needs and disagree on

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,160
strategies

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,680
but until you know that you agree on

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,000
needs it's really difficult to talk

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,200
about strategies

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,320
invent options for mutual games so this

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,800
is the

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,079
intelligent quadrant of the catalyst

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,400
polygraph

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,800
try to look for things that benefit the

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,400
self and to others

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
one can listen to the others and not

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,560
make a final decision until everybody

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,960
feels that they have been hurt

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,800
and people should clearly explain their

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,400
intention and what they want out of the

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,200
conversation

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,000
insist on using objective criteria for

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,000
example

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,680
your idea can never be good if you wrote

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,880
it with nano

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,480
right i mean seriously

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,119
make sure that the conversation stays on

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,560
topic and that it is productive

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,400
try to find out what the others

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,839
intentions are keep an open mind

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,520
and don't give in to pressure or threats

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,920
everybody is in charge of keeping the

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,079
others committed to the conversation

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,440
everyone is responsible for keeping the

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,079
conversation useful

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,160
and everybody is responsible for trying

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,079
to keep the relationship healthy

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,400
it's kind of the three axis of the gra

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,920
of the graphs

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
and know your best alternative to

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,880
negotiated agreement that is

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,960
keep in mind other options and regularly

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,119
reconsider your plan b's as the

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,520
discussion continues

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,200
resist the urge to compromise for fear

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,000
of not getting anything out of the

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,680
discussion

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,359
it may help making the discussion

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,200
shorter but it may also leave

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,440
everyone with a solution that doesn't

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,440
benefit them that much

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,040
and when considering final decisions you

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,520
may want to take a step back and

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,599
consider all possible alternative to

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,359
this tentative proposal i think in

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,560
debian we do this pretty well already

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,000
it's actually

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,599
there's always another step of seeing

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
if there's a better thing and sometimes

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:08,000
we never get to the end of a discussion

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,200
but it's actually important to do that

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,280
to a certain point so that was all the

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,599
recap of the key takeaways

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,599
there is benefit to self benefit to

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,400
others and trying to invest in a healthy

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,880
relationship

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,040
you can and should learn what drives you

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,920
and you can try to turn conflict into

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:31,440
actionable change

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:34,880
okay we have time for a few questions

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:46,400
first one is from boyo

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:50,240
how can

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,280
yo i often find picky code reuse help me

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,280
write better code

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:03,119
i switched on the microphone okay

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,640
uh yeah so we we kind of replied to this

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,079
a bit on the pad already

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,640
um yeah i i think it's a very good

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,079
question

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,280
because one wants to ensure that one can

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,800
learn

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,440
and i think it needs negotiation

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
because there might be people who uh

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,119
want

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,520
to get nitpicked on and

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,560
or or who can use that and then there's

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,000
also a way

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:34,320
to do it like maybe the reviewer

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
is going beyond

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,960
what is needed to learn and

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,640
maybe uh people can also feel controlled

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,599
and policed or

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,240
actually lose self-worth if they get

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,920
five

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,440
gigantic nitpick rounds which contain

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,280
ninety percent of useless information

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,359
so i think it's kind of important to

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,520
talk about it and mention one's own

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,800
needs

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,780
yeah similarly i would think that

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,319
it depends um

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:12,480
[Music]

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,040
i have a wait um i think that it depends

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,560
uh

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,079
on what are the priorities of the people

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,119
who review and the people who are

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,520
reviewed

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:26,880
um sometimes i may be in the mood for

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,920
long tweaking that may help incur my co

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,200
improve my quality sometimes i

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,960
may be more in the mood for being told

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,440
that i actually fix the issue in an

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,800
acceptable way

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,359
if the things are mixed then i

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,000
may always feel like an outsider because

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,000
people

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,040
keep telling me that what i do is never

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,400
okay

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,839
uh or i feel not

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,839
challenged because or i have a hard time

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,079
entering into a team because

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,880
i don't get to learn the practices of

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,400
the team

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,079
so things could change a lot and also

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,359
the reviewer may not always be in the

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,880
mood for

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:14,480
um for writing legtine epics and

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,520
teaching things and explaining things so

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,000
um i think it depends and i think

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,560
what the the worst thing is to talk

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,560
about it

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,839
okay next question is are the slides for

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
this stock going to be put online

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,040
yes we uploaded them

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,960
so they should appear on the page of our

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,440
talk normally i think

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,400
but enrico will also upload it to his

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,440
blog

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,440

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,800

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,319

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,520
done

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,839
okay i think we can wait a bit for more

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,839
questions right now there are not more

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:34,560
okay so no more questions

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:44,880
