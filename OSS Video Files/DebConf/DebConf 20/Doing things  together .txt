Our thoughts about cooperation aspects of doing things together.

Sometimes in Debian we do work together with others, and sometimes we are a number of people who work alone, and happen to all upload their work in the same place.

In times when we have needed to take important decisions together, this distinction has become crucial, and some of us might have found that we were not as good at cooperation as we would have thought.

This talk is intended for everyone who is part of a larger community. We will show concepts and tools that we think could help understand and shape cooperation.
