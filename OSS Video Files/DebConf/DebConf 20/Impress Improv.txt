	00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,400
and now for something completely

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,200
new refreshing and different at the same

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,840
time

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
let's say have a session of impress

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,320
improve

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,039
so here we go i haven't seen whatever

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,039
follows next

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,359
so we we will talk about

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
well not exactly the new maintainers

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,119
process but

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,640
about how we use a combined harvester

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,760
for tidying up for a flower pot

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
it's time to harvest

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
uh what we are doing has been unchanged

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,559
for centuries

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,320
it's a long tradition we have been

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,039
receiving reviewing all over

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,280
and doing more or less the same uh what

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,719
we have to do is to mow and bind

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,320
the the crops that are cut by sight

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,039
binding them together uh building a

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,079
regular structures in semi-parameter

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,879
fashion

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,199
is some people say it looks like a tent

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
i

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,159
i don't know i i i still feel this more

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
as a cone

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:18,720
or a sheath right a

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,720
making a stick so it dries correctly

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,520
in the past what we have is a a

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,680
manual separation called threshing

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,799
so the grains would be separated from

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,280
the chaff

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
this uh this broad

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,520
need to beat grains out of ears that was

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,479
known as

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
illustrated here in this beautiful graph

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,079
by

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,280
flailing the the

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,439
the chaff and the until

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,040
the grains fall out of the ears it's a

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,920
very intensive step

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,719
a very intensive work so a whole family

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,240
has to

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,280
be involved in order to reach the step

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,159
the point we want to achieve so mowers

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
and treasures

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120
as seasonal workers have to travel from

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,160
farm to farm to farm

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,000
and they offer their work which is a

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,280
a very very sorely needed sometimes

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
and a high percentage of percentage of

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
people

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
tend to to work in agriculture at that

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,000
time

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,760
a as you know the debian project

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,239
is striving to automate processes

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
so we have been involved in mowing

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,000
machines

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,840
which has been yielding the

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,400
the consequence of replacing the mowers

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,400
so one person can do the work of dozens

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,440
that does bring in an

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,319
interesting social pro problem to

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
to our table but well what can we do we

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,080
will address that later probably

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,400
the first versions were run by by

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,200
horsepower that was more or less until

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
sarge

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
after search we started doing this by

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,920
machine

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
it was so fast our machines got so fast

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800
by them

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
that binding became the bottleneck in

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
bottlenecks so

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,319
that was the next step we have to

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,599
automate next so

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,799
we we put up together reaper binders

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,519
that started automatic both mowing and

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,440
binding

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
that's a very interesting development

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,599
that had entire teams

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,159
uh working together as a with a single

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,640
uh target in mind which is very very

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,040
very uncommon for our distribution

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,799
right the invention was made trying to

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,040
catch a dog with a string

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
where the toxic circumvent is being

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,000
caught by biting the string

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,319
this reminds us of the new process

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,439
where you upload a package and the ftp

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,439
master say no

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,480
and you upload it again and they say no

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,640
and until

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,680
you reach a point where nobody can

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,480
object anymore

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,879
and an artificial duck snout was built

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,920
to

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,640
bind the ships together

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,360
then we focused on fresh thrashing

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
machines

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
they were also built on horsepower by in

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,079
the early days

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
and they were shared between farms we

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,600
set up

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,400
render farms or bldds and the

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,240
the the the threshing machines were

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,720
manually carried from

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,800
one farm to another you could refer to

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
to the presentations done some dev comes

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
ago for example the

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,880
multi-arm reproducibly monster

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,160
by vagrant that's one of the examples on

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,759
how we started to to break that trend

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,320
then harvesters are getting combined

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
it's a very exciting development that

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,919
was

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,520
more or less done in the lenny days

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,720
right the whole process

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,759
happens in one machine so we start doing

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,199
containers we start doing a

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,759
virtual servers we we use many uh

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,639
different techniques to do in one single

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,880
machine what do

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,639
what we did in our distributed fashion

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,840
beforehand

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,039
one person now does the work of wix

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,199
in only a few hours this

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,160
was originally done on the us only

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
because we have

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
non-u.s section cryptography was not

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,720
exportable but at some time

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
a this was exported to europe and one

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
once it was introduced to germany well

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,840
the whole world had to take part of it

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,360
and the non-us became a thing of the

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,759
past a

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
in eastern europe this got much faster

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
of course

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,000
uh some historical ones

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,039
have made had a bales of straw

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,520
a today destroys either

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,360
thrown out of the bales from by the by

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,240
if you're different machine or

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
it is shred which is very interesting

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
it's uh

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
an instance of eating your own dog food

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,919
you

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,520
you you shred the

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,120
destroy itself and use it as a

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,759
fertilizer so

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
the output of the ability this becomes

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,560
what the ability runs to keep

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,360
building it's it's it's really exciting

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,080
so what does the future hold for us well

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
we will be

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,240
combining harvesters maybe we will set

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
up something like a

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,720
multi a multi architecture

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,600
buildings so we can grind the grains

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,479
together

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,240
prepare and bake bread from the

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,680
abilities themselves

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,720
uh this will be used by building

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,039
strawmen for easier argumentation

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,639
and this will be delivered to customers

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,919
using carrier pigeons

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,520
that's great in pandemic times right

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,919
in the future more will come full

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,639
virtualization you will not even need a

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,800
field

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,960
you will be you you will have a virtual

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,599
field in your living room that will be

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,960
really one of the highlights of the

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,199
debian 11 or 12.

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,319
what does this all have to do with

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,160
flower pots

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,319
well we can talk about the

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
virtualization opportunities we can talk

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,039
about

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
the consolidation we're doing the

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,000
container she the containers were

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,880
building but no

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,479
it has nothing to do it doesn't bring

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,560
out the combined harvester

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,599
but but it helps tidying up the flower

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,440
pot

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,960
so thank you very much for your time i

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,720
hope this

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,560
session proved interesting to you and

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
well that was it thank you

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,039
fearful misconceptions of unknown future

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,240
markets

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,599
and unknown slags

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
where does it come from uh

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,520
origami a little bit of data as you can

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,840
see a lot of charts go

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,400
upwards the charts go upwards the charts

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,080
go upwards

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,080
so that clearly leads to some

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
correlation

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,960
so is correlation happening here or

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,960
elsewhere

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,240
is it really correlating or is it

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,440
dividing from

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,440
what is actually a useful

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,640
is it really correlated or is it

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,640
a bunch of numbers

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,640
[Music]

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,440
um oh boy this is really correlated is

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,839
it

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,240
or is it you know there's a book

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,519
um why

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,760
it shows an interesting statistics and

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,760
why

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,839
correlation isn't causation they say in

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
statistics

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,360
so marriage rate in kentucky and people

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,839
who drowned after falling out of a

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,480
fishing

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,720
boat well many things that decline or

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,800
many things that decline uh do not

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,480
correlate with other things that decline

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,839
many things that are going up do not

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,320
correlate with of the things that are

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,320
going up

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,760
so yeah be careful what you say about

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,760
correlation on causation

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,839
no idea what that pathway

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,680
and credits thank you

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
good morning people i'm going to talk

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,959
about something

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,959
i have not a slightest clue about

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,279
okay this is nothing special but this

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,720
time i don't even know what i will talk

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,120
about

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,560
somehow i hope the slides will be in

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
english but who knows

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,880
okay the topic is about

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,480
cryptography great as a debian person i

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,839
obviously

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,600
have no clue at all about cryptography

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,760
because we

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,040
don't have anything to hide it's another

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
social contract

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,839
so we will see

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,279
ah and the whole thing is also about

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,720
hackers

00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:01,839
hackers are evil people who will fix

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
your bags

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,240
and that use weird devices to do weird

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,800
thing with them

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,800
well it's nothing very surprising

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,279
ah and yeah hackers also play along with

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,320
things

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,920
and they love all kind of

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,839
beauty especially they admire and love

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
the beauty and the ugliness

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,160
and they already understand everything

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
in practice they understand nothing

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,000
and they don't obey they don't obey to

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
anyone

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
especially not to them

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,920
and they don't care about if you

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,680
went to university or anything they just

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,480
care about do you have a clue about what

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
you speak about and what not so in this

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,440
case i'm in trouble because i have no

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,000
clue about what i'm speaking about

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,760
and obviously they don't like if someone

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,519
is

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:14,160
running with a camera and

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,160
looking at them no one likes this

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,760
and they tend to tell

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,519
countries and states what they are doing

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,399
wrong

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,399
yeah and of course it also should be fun

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
yeah cryptography is if i'm writing

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,279
something and no one sees it

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,480
so if i go like this and write something

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
this is cryptography

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,920
yeah in many cases earlier cryptography

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,200
was just

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:57,360
weird things but then

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,360
they had some mathematics behind it

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,880
and it became actually a scientific

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
discipline

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,839
yeah this is rsa

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:23,279
if you want to break rsa

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,839
then you need to factorize very big

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,839
numbers

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,800
what is an np complete problem

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,079
as far as we know

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,440
but maybe p is

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,360
the same as np's or who knows oh

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,839
i'm running heavily out of time what

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:52,160
never happened

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:55,839
yeah obviously if i'm not anonymous then

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,440
i need to all the time think oh

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,959
if i'm doing something will this have

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,839
consequences for me

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,839
and the better

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,680
i can hide the better for me and it's

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,880
easier to hide in a big crowd

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,000
than in a small crowd so it's better to

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,000
be an uploading dd

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,160
because there are 800 of them that are

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:30,240
not uploading dd because there are about

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:34,320
35 of them

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:38,560
this is yeah big proxy

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
you then do this then to this

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:47,279
then to this and this one

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
just knows this one

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,000
this one just knows this one and so on

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,399
and so no one knows what you are looking

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,399
for

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:06,399
yeah you can also do cryptography

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,399
with paper and scissors

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,839
and this was it

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,560
thank you very much now comes the live

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
part of

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,800
this of this session and first up

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,399
is aloisio to tell us everything

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,480
you always wanted to know about ham

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
radio repeaters but we're afraid to ask

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,560
all right so good afternoon good evening

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
good night to everyone

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,839
we are here to talk about the repeater

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,240
start hem radio 2.

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,759
stark stands for the showing the amateur

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,600
repeaters too

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,759
uh so i'm gonna try to change slides

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,160
here yeah why ham radio

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,440
uh him radio works many places where a

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,040
cell phone won't

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,360
it's not just some thousand dollars

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,199
large box you can check out internet

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
radio linking project with a handheld

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,399
radio

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,399
all-stars repeaters orders linked around

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,360
the world and they're all accessible

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,560
with a handheld

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,920
uhf or dhf radio about 100

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,399
or less so what about repeaters

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,399
as any of any hand radio listener knows

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,800
it's often really quiet locally

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
so uh use a repeater near you they're

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
often linked

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,120
to other places around the world which

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,800
is very nice but where are those

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
repeaters repeater book

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,560
is a not open source app uh and only for

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,079
proprietary mobile phones like ios and

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
android based devices

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,240
our finder is also a proprietary app

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
it's a paid proprietary app

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,560
actually and so we've got this new app

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,120
that's allow you to browse all the

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,600
nearby repeaters and around the world

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
you can see what irlp repeaters are

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
linking to

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
and that's updated every 10 minutes you

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,480
can show offline like when you're in the

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,680
woods which is pretty nice you can show

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
a topographic map

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,360
which all the repeater apps don't

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
uh so talking about especially

00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
specifically about the repeated star

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,839
details

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,519
it's an open source gpl available as a

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,760
dead package and it's really easy to

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,679
install as on that yen ubuntu raspberry

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,000
pi librium phone etc

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,160
and it uses the only open data repeater

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
project with data you can also use

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,839
in your offline application and you can

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,079
check out more at

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,199
herehem.live this is a screenshot

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,120
from from the app you can see here uh

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,799
when you got the cursor centered there

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,319
you can find information about the

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,520
nearest repeaters that

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,440
are shown on the map and you can add a

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,240
repeater to the dictionary to sort the

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,000
directory

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,559
by clicking the add repeater button down

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,760
there and you can also press the

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:45,520
geoclue find position to see where

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,440
you are and i guess that's it

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,200
and so what to do next you can find

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
frequencies nearby that locals are

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
chatting on

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,600
you can use the repeater start listing

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,360
enough frequencies nearby

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,320
so you can listen to on rtl sdr or radio

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
or whatever

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,559
and you can get a hand radio license and

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,600
talk and use it where there are no

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,559
cell phones and that's basically it

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,840
thank you very much and have a very good

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,840
deb conf this year

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:26,000
uh thank you very much uh next up

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,480
next up is ben who will be

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,039
um who has had some slides inflicted

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,039
upon him

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
you're on mute

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,320
i'm on news and i also haven't

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,320
with it

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,760
should i just sort of also you really

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,039
rustly

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,039
please refrain from wrestling

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,840
rustling is not permitted in the impress

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,840
improv session

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,440
um meanwhile oh hi nicholas

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,320
i guess we're just keeping keeping

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,360
everybody entertained keep everything

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,400
from stalling

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,600
whilst um oh

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,200
brilliant choreography by gunnar um uh

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:24,080
sure my squid isn't doing anything well

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,280
try uh

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,280
possibly possibly i need to send a pdf

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,280
um okay well i guess i will

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:39,840
i've also had some slides inflicted upon

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:43,280
me so i'll see if that gets any better

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,280
application window

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,840
oh well that's a bit rubbish

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,120
uh one moment please

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:07,840
uh i think i need to regenerate this

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,840
as a pdf

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,240
if somebody else could uh oh hello

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,520
um if somebody else could oh

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,600
that's good is it working uh

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,320
no it's blank can you can you turn it

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,320
into a pdf

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,840
and hope for the best that that gets

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
but

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,200
we apologize for the fault in the

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:49,840
improvisations

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,840
those responsible have been sacked

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,440
export save

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,840
let's hope this is in some way better

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,360
meanwhile would anybody on the impress

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,159
improv panel like to share an experience

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,480
or how this um how the session came

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,480
about

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:35,840
yes it was a discussion on

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:39,200
the mini def con online irc

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,520
and gunnar asked if someone wants to do

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,840
slides on spanish and i was silly enough

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,240
to say yes

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,799
ah that's always dangerous

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,799
it was a very internationalized spanish

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,039
it was almost english what they sent you

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,039
okay so is that good yes

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,200
right

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,679
everything i know about historical brass

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,679
instruments

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,919
here you see the uh amazing

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,919
uh

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,640
these would be played by a trio

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:26,300
of usually family me family members

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:29,460
and they made an awful racket

00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,460
[Music]

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,799
uh here is a saxophone uh there is some

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
controversy over what

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,240
exactly which family of instruments that

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,120
saxophone belongs to

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
uh they may be made of brass uh but uh

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,799
some people claim

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,600
that uh they're actually woodwinds so

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,600
they should need it

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,440
and this is a chauffeur it's

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
uh

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,360
clearly been carved out of a uh

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,480
a narwhal tusk that being the

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,440
traditional material

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,440
and uh

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,799
that's uh apparently a brass instrument

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,799
i don't know

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,320
this one looks like it's just been

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,000
unwrapped from

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,799
its uh traditional uh traditional

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,799
uh bag

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:36,559
[Music]

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,840
uh and this is yes it's a serpent

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,520
uh which historically uh

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,039
was made from a from a dead

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,320
snake which would be uh gutted

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,400
and cured and then you would have these

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,200
uh

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,200
uh archers and um

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,960
controls uh connected to it but today uh

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,520
it would be made out of synthetic

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,520
material

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,840
and so this is

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,480
[Music]

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,640
this is uh

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,200
this is this diagram explains how that

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,760
you how you would uh

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,960
um how you construct a serpent

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,480
uh you would start with a basic

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,360
cylindrical form

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,360
and then uh

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,159
wrap the uh rub the case around that

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,550
well thanks nettie thanks for small

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,080
mercies

00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,400
[Music]

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
ah

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,360
yep that's that definitely isn't a brass

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,640
instrument or any kind of wind

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,960
instrument

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
uh

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,039
much older than the others uh and

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,559
yeah it's it's traditional when playing

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,360
it to look uh

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:42,510
look away to make to make it a little

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:45,579
more difficult

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,579
[Music]

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,360
roll credits thank you very much um

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:57,120
i guess well turnabout is fair play

00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,000
so i guess i'm doing this

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,000
one moment please

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:09,760
application window where is this thing

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,799
um just a moment

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,799
i can do this better

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,600
if i share my entire screen it's just

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,919
going to end in tears i think

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,919
but

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,600
is that working

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,840
that's not working one moment

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,000
um is that showing

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,400
no i don't think showing the whole

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,600
screen works at all oh hold on

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,360
a specific window it doesn't seem to

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,080
actually come on the menu

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,080
just a moment

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,120
i have vlc i have uh

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,520
excuse me help is on the way um

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,840
meanwhile would anybody on the panel

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,960
like to offer offer another opinion

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,279
or

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,240
well we were getting an offer for

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,039
somebody

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,600
who had not signed up for this to

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,120
actually

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,480
take part did this person join

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,679
yeah i i said on irc i said man i regret

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,919
not doing impress improv

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,600
and then uh and then uh yonder was like

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,679
you can still go you can still do it and

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,760
i said okay i'll join

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,480
why not our session director agrees have

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,520
uh

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,720
just uh compiled a very old magic point

00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:01,039
stack and shared it on the

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,360
gt chat so well nadi should say what and

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,399
when

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,279
and how it's too long so you can pick

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,799
just a section for it

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,919
okay i i if it's cool with you guys

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:17,840

stuff open oh

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:41,520
[Music]

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,320
copy link address are you guys doing

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,520
today good

oh

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
you want me to do this

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,919
or somebody who's muted uh started this

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,880
maybe

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,279
yeah this is nathis so let's respect her

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,279
order

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,520
help has arrived help has helped me

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,440
um

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:20,559
so i guess i'm doing this this life

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,520
this logo is a beautiful embroidery

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,640
pattern

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:30,320
has issued its annual report for 2020.

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,600
production has been steadily increasing

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,559
oh my goodness intracompatibility growth

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,200
has happened

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,880
and metastable units are increasing

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,960
precision delivery is

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,360
always important but doesn't always

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,360
happen

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,919
production well production rests on the

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,960
back

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,640
of people

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,320
people in every shade of the rainbow

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,720
because the rainbow is good

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,720
now augmentation means that your

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,520
interval is slightly bigger than what

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,520
you intended

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,799
so as the augmentation carries on and

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,720
occasionally slips

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,720
eventually the result is yes

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,120
development well

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,120
there are aliens who

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,840
occasionally aliens are involved in

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,840
development

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,440
but most importantly we must always

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,760
honor the hippopotamus

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,880
also for the benefit of all involved

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:39,600
here is a capybara photo

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,320
development continues but the colors

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,919
scheme

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,280
is well actually the color scheme is

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,520
okay um

00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,120
[Music]

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,360
there's always geometry involved in

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,840
development and

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,279
there is always a slightly dodgy light

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,480
source just off the center of the photo

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,399
please remember to always make sure that

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,640
your blinds are in the correct position

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,679
so that development can continue in an

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,039
unhindered fashion

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,399
social media well some of us believe in

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,279
that sort of thing

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:17,279
but memes are important

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,840
because they contribute to the memetic

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,840
synergy

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,320
heterogeneous amplification means that

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,519
you know different people can boost

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,360
different things

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,679
and this results in leverage

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,440
which of course is what happens to the

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,240
memetic synergy after

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,240
after long enough

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,480
um further social media

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,919
uh results in an organic text because

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,760
inorganic texts

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,159
are currently not really being printed

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,640
vernacular propagation means that you

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,600
can read your social media

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,000
in whatever language you choose which of

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,720
course

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,720
is very inclusive and

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,000
if you wish to

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,840
if you wish to organize vernacular

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,880
propagation in your language this is

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,399
always very welcome

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,200
and the credits um that was a lot of

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,320

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,480
okay great i'm gonna i'll start why not

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,279
i'm going to

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,120
share my screen how do i do that boom

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,840
and i'm going to go to the application

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,519
window

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,720
okay uh hopefully you guys see this oh

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,240
nice one do you want to do you want to

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,720
just put picture in picture by

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,360
clicking the camera icon picture by

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,399
picture by

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,039
clicking the camera icon uh

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,000
which oh oh oh oh yes yeah there we go

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,200
so you see my face now

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,960
right there you are yeah there we go

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,360
okay um pearl security some ideas

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,960
to follow when programming with pearl

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,679
and this was made

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,840
relatively recently in the year 2004.

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,679
puerto rico great brazil

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,440
so uh i'll just do uh

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,960
i don't know i'll go through the first

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,559
couple slides and then you guys just

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,159
tell me a stop or whatever

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,760
um so we're going to go over a couple

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
things about this

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,200
an introduction into programming

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,039
securely with perl

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:04,000
avoiding and avoiding uh bad practices

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,360
reporting warnings handling data when

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,360
using functions

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,720
using functions using objects and

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,320
randomly organized

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,919
extras target audience is people who

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,359
probably code curl curl

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,960
which i don't but that's fine

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,639
uh conscious people trying to avoid

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,240
mistakes before it's too late

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,159
you know uh you put uh

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,760
you make one bad decision when you're

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,119
like programming uh

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,879
encryption i don't think you're supposed

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,879
to do that yourself and then

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,639
uh right you got ransomware on your

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:41,040
computer common mistakes useful ideas

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,480
let's see here here again another just

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,720
just in case you didn't know

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,119
just in case you didn't know here's what

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,560
we're going to be doing

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,760
why is a good security wise about pearl

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,680
uh what is good security wise about perl

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,920
um well non-typified variables

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,200
you don't have to tip the variables like

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,680
you do in the

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,880
united states you have to uh you don't

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,000
have to do that the

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,440
the tipping is done in the price of the

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,599
variable itself

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,800
which is great and much better cost

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,839
effective

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,200
automatic memory management so you don't

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,320
need to worry about

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,400
doing m alec and c alec and all those

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,760
uh pleasantly good unix

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,520
methods functions high extensibility you

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,000
can

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,040
use pro for a bunch of things you can

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,760
compile it quickly

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,640
quickly and i in fact i'm pretty sure

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,280
isn't pearl

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,800
an interpreted language anyways and

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,560
transparent alternate

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,320
transparent alternation between compile

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,640
and execute styles

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,320
uh let's see it go what is not a lot of

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,480
simplicity and power

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:56,160
um is not that is not that oh my god

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,160
okay rc

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,000
and then uh let's see what else it is

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,119
not objects to not just

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,320
be seen as a patch you can't just use

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,119
objects to cover up bad programming

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,000
package

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:14,079
practices encourage programmers to

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,599
believe in black magic um

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,839
yeah you can't believe in black magic

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,800
that's bad that's bad in case you didn't

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,240
know

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,520
again here here's what we're doing

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,440
um and uh introduction to strict brief

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,800
pragmas living with district pa are you

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,560
guys excited to learn are you guys

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,599
excited to learn about what this is

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,960
strict fars variable scooping

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,320
um except only variables declared with

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,760
and um yep

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,760
all right i'm done i'm done

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,320
we have had a question from the audience

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,839
which is why is a raven like a writing

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,280
desk

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,920
why is a raven like a writing desk

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,720
i don't think anybody else knows either

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,560
a rate like

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:06,320
the bird a raven um

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,839
is the desk writing or

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,839
i don't know i mean

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,760
i mean if the desk is writing that could

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,680
that is like

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
automatic this would be like an

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,000
automatic

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,160
um wouldn't this be sort of analogous to

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,359
artificial intelligence

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,280
i think both have uh for both you have a

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:33,520
feeder it's like a mechanical turk

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,280
that uh that runs a harvest attractor

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,480
yeah i mean the thing with mechanical

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,119
turks is they're really supposed to be

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,119
playing chess

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,440
so you know engaging them in in

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,640
agriculture is

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,640
really just um

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,359
really just sort of you know averting

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,359
them from their true calling

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,400
which would be chess

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,280
let me see if there are any more are

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,440
there any more questions

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,440
from from the audience

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:18,400
oh dear somebody has just told us raven

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:21,040
jokes are no cause for alarm

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,480
any more questions oh yes are there any

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,640
programmers who don't believe in black

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,680
magic

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,520
no even though it's bad

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,680
nicholas tells us it's bad well yes but

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,040
i i do not believe in coloring magic in

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,119
different ways i mean

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,680
what if what you see as black magic i

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,480
see it as red magic

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,119
well i mean i've also just been informed

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,480
that in chessmen has rooks not ravens

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,960
they're not black magic but they are

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,880
black birds so

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,160
that's usually the case yes i have not

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,760
seen a red

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,400
raven though they're not the same as

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,400
blackbirds

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,520
also did you know that the blue bird by

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,720
sanford is not about a bluebird but

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,720
about a blue bird

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,000
does anybody else have anything any more

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,440
questions any more comments

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,839
this is not so much a question as a

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,720
comment

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,720
anything goes here um

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,280
ah i've been informed you'll find both

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,920
of the tower of london

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,320
oh that's a terrible pun both mechanical

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,839
turks and ravens

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,000
but the mechanical ferrets come into

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,000
this

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:42,560
oh mechanical turks right

00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:45,119
oh yeah

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,680
black magic and red magic that's that's

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,680
very true

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,359
yeah oh i should actually look at the

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,880
ether pad is anybody else looking at the

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:59,280
ether pad because i'm not

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,640
well trapper is asking whether i did

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,960
upload harvester

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,839
uh no i was planning to harvest the

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,839
uploads first

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,119
oh here's an actual question um for

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,319
pearl u's prefer bash for security i

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,839
think that would be

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:21,520
an ecumenical matter and

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,200
um wait what he's

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,920
what they say bash for security

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,119
yeah let's bash the security oh i

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,119
thought bash was on glow

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,599
but i think should we

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,359
um should we carry on trying to fill the

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:46,960
next five minutes

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:50,480
it does become more secure

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,839
if you replace it with bash

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,599
well you can replace many things with a

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,880
very short very small shell

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,680
script sorry say that three times fast

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,960
you can replace more most directors for

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,920
shell script

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,680
most speakers probably also unless

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,200
unless they're wearing the director hat

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,839
um i believe it is absolutely

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,839
essential

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,800
to show the director hat either director

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,240
had a red black or

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,480
some other color no it's blue what what

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,079
what is this director hat maybe just a

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,400
minute just a minute

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,440
you have neither a hat nor a chair what

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,440
kind of director are you

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,839
rude um

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,200
aren't you the talk master yeah i know

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,720
that

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,880
see the director is actually the

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:49,520
director is actually being sensible here

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:52,319
um but here is um here is

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,319
just a moment

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,520
view image sorry

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,160
no that's not what i wanted to but view

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,839
image oh nevermind

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,839
f11 where are you

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,040
sharing the screen

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,640
sharing the window

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,599
everybody behold the director hat

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,440
it is about it it is thing of beauty and

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,839
is

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,610
possibly coming soon to a dub conf near

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,839
you um

00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:37,359
[Music]

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,200
probably later rather than sooner

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,599
so now you need to wear this when

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,880
directing otherwise you're not accepted

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,640
as director

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,319
well i wouldn't go that far but it just

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,000
gives you um

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,319
it means that you can't be replaced by a

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,240
very small shell script

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,839
yeah just by a little bit bigger script

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,839
i mean the hat does take up a lot of

00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839
scripting

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,440
so we have two minutes remaining

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,440
any final comments

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,839
could you write a shell script in two

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,920
minutes nope

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,359
of course you can well i could write

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,359
shells you could write

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,480
what do you mean by shell script okay i

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,160
need this right right

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,079
anything you write in a shell is a

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,880
special script of course yeah

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,800
if every one of my comments were to take

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,960
