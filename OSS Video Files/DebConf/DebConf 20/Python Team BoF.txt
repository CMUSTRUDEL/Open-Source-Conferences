00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,920
welcome to the python buff um

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,160
i'm pretty sure a bunch of people are

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,600
gonna join us uh

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,359
during the um but if you want to join

uh you can come in the deviant python

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
irc channel and ask for a link and we'll

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,119
be happy to send you one

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,719
um so the agenda for today

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,000
is um at the moment first of all maybe a

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,640
little uh

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,440
uh introduction introducing ourselves

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,320
saying uh

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,520
who you are what are we doing in the uh

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
python team

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
and then uh are you talking about it

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,480
packed into the application

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,160
see um how how that went uh

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
how much work do we still need to do on

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,000
that uh afterward

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,120
uh i'd be happy to talk about merging

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,559
the

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,520
pipt and the mpt together and talk about

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,120
this later

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,720
and um yeah uh maybe finishing my little

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
reminder of the python sprint

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,720
tomorrow i don't know if anybody else

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,840
wants to add anything

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
to the agenda

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,560
looks fine maybe some sponsorship stuff

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
at the end but it's low priority this

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,720
time left at the end

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
yeah and uh sponsorship requests can

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
also

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,840
be uh be done tomorrow during the sprint

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
video

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,799
all right maybe a little introduction

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,600
there's some faces i haven't seen so hi

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,560
i'm puyo i haven't been a dd for very

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,920
long

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,960
but i've been uh volunteering with the

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,840
deep in

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,799
the vid depcon video team for a while

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,439
now

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,159
um and i've been maintaining a few

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,799
packages

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,799
in the python team uh mostly

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,720
applications

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
we should go around the room let me

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,840
speak

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,120
so i'm stefano rivera i maintain a bunch

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,640
of python libraries

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,160
and the pie pie interpreter

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,440
which fortunately doesn't seem to get

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,440
too much use in debian yet

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,840
this next scrub is i guess

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,400
robert is the director for the talk oh

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,360
yeah didn't see go next

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
okay uh i'm entering openstack in debian

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,760
which

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,200
as you may know is written in python

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,120
so therefore i i'm in charge of

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,120
a few hundred python packages

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
next next person

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,959
anthony

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,319
hi i was hi i'm anthony and i

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,480
became a dd in 1997 and um

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,120
i've been involved in like chinese cjk i

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,159
18n

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,000
and localization et cetera i'm a small

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,400
contributor to the python team uh

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,319
with just a few packages i think the

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,959
most recent one being a time keeper

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,599
which is a parental control program i

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:47,840
think that's it

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:47,840

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,120
in until

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,680
a few months ago so well i

i'm mostly maintaining

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,680
several python packages in the team

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,040
module packages and i'm usually

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,360
taking part in various

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,240
whole team activities like removing

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,240
python 2 and

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,280
odex's connection seems a bit bad so

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,479
i'll just keep it to me so my name is

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,800
jonathan carter

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,960
also known as high voltage i maintain a

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,759
few leaf packages in the python team

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,960
and also sponsor some packages when the

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
sponsorship requests

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
now and again

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,600
do you hi do you want to introduce

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,800
yourselves quickly uh

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,360
and then we're going to move on to the

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
next topic

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,440
and mute yourself um um alex

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
uh writing from talking from switzerland

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,919
i

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,919
used to maintain a little bit of person

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,520
packages but i just hang out to see

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,639
what's happening in that conf so

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,759
don't bother me

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
don't mind me actually

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
chip so um hi everybody i'm not kirsch

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
and

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,759
uh i i became a tv recently but i've

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,880
been contributing to the python team

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
i've been maintaining a couple of

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,600
modules but uh besides i've been

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
mentoring and sponsoring a lot of

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,080
uploads in the team

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,520
i've been trying to um make this

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:21,840
the queue shorter uh the rfsq

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,840
um so yeah

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,960
hector yeah hello i'm

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,840
hector i maintain some packages

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,440
icon packages and i'm just around the

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
python team

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,919
to see what's going on and if i can help

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,919
somehow

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:49,840
and rebecca now

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,919
i guess we should move on

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
okay yeah so next topic uh the python 2

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,520
lubrication

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,360
um so i think

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
maybe i'm not the first best person to

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,800
talk about this somebody else who's been

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:17,840
more involved with me can uh

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
take the lead on that topic

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,680
yeah go ahead stefano you're the man

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,199
i don't know if i am i haven't been i

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
think you're i think you're better than

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,120
most of

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
than any of us in the channel at the

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
moment

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,879
um i don't actually know what the

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,240
current state is has does anybody

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,639
so the statue is 95 packages remaining

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,479
in

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,680
in testing and

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
210 in seed

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,840
that on the release team transition page

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,560
i would guess we're getting to the point

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
where we're getting to the pi to keep

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,000
packages

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
um i don't know what the long term plans

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
are there so this is somewhere

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,360
where i do have an interest uh i kind of

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
need some of these stick around for a

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,919
while

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,199
um yeah so you said the back story there

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
is pi pi uses c

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,039
python to build it it doesn't have to it

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,319
could use pi pi to build it but then

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,319
you've got bootstrapping problems

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,320
so yeah for me i imagine it will remain

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,959
a something that's available in the

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
archive

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,600
but not something we want users to be

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
using

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,440
so python 2.7 would stay in the archive

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,800
but not be regretted by anything

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,839
something like that uh what about

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,839
the buy to keep packages

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,839
are we going to remove those two

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,839
it's a good question because

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,240
we are not removing them then

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,839
method two stays and some third-party

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,040
models probably too

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,040
as i see it

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,399
one thing i've been asking myself is

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,040
when i'm going to upgrade my laptop from

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,760
buster to bullseye then what is going to

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
happen like

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,800
probably is going to keep all the old uh

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,320
removed

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,959
item two dependencies right um

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,839
sure so is there something we can do

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,240
about it

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,920
why just because like

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,279
we don't support them anymore and it's

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,920
going to stay on on

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,560
people's computers even if if we don't

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,560
support them

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,399
that is the same that's not a unique

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
problem to us that applies to any

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,680
package

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,160
yeah yeah i think there is not usually

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,480
is

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,600
to have the section about ordered

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,680
removed packages

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,959
but in usually

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,160
not not upgrading

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,480
this so not sure what's the current

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,120
practice

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,279
yeah i'm not sure that forcibly removing

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,800
python 2 packages from people's computer

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,800
when the upgrade is a good idea

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,160
right so let's say i'm aware of the

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,839
problem and i want to remove them maybe

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
it's going to be very annoying to list

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,000
them

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,839
how about we do a package that would uh

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
uh i don't know conflict or whatever so

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,519
that just it would remove all the stuff

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,399
if i want to

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,920
if you remove python 2.7 it just removes

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,760
everything that depends on it

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,920
so you shouldn't have any problem yeah i

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,560
did that at my my set desktop

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,320
like two days ago and a bunch of python

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,200
2 libraries got removed and

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,200
everything still works

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,680
but then you have the problem if python

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,680
27 stays in the archive

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,680
and i wonder if moving to bootstrapping

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
piper wouldn't be better

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,720
because then you can actually remove

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,600
python 27

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
and only like have i rely on pi pi so

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,320
you move

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
from the problem of having python27 to

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,480
have to bootstrap pipeline but maybe

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
that's better

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,160
yeah i mean from my point of view it

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
doesn't it's not

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,839
a huge problem to do that it makes some

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,839
things a bit slower but that's

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
fine

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,200
uh slow for machines um i mean it's also

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,480
a little more work as a

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,959
maintainer you've got to manually

00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,000
bootstrap things um

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,000
so what we're doing there is um

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,480
pi pi we build pi pi with pi pi on

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,399
architectures that have jet

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
and we use the python architectures that

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,360
don't

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,040
but on all of the architectures where

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
it's buildable you can use it even if

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,639
it's really slow

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,079
pi pi 3 itself still requires a python 2

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,040
interpreter to build which is why i need

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,519
to keep pi pi around

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,880
there is some slow process people are

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,079
starting to talk about it upstream but

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,839
there isn't actually any process

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,000
progress yet

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:38,079
but maybe at some point in the future

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,320
that won't be necessary anymore

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,480
one thing is certain is that if python

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,000
2.7 stays in the archive

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,839
we need to be clear that there's no

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,560
security support from it and people

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
shouldn't be downloading it and using it

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,839
and probably shouldn't make it into

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,839
stable releases

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,920
although yeah i'm sure that the users

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,920
would appreciate it if it did

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,200
well but then there's then you have to

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,399
talk to the security team

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,720
yeah i mean

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,399
as long as you're shipping button to i

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
think people are going to use it because

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,680
they they don't really want to move from

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,560
binding to the button three

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,120
uh they won't divide them into sports so

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,839
it'll be

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,560
like nice if you don't ship under at all

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,560
in the first place

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,959
yeah at some point just removing it and

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,519
having

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,079
all the sky break clues might be the

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,079
best option

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,560
i guess it all comes to uh stefano if

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,880
you're okay with

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,320
having to bootstrap pipefire from from

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,279
itself

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,399
i i also feel that removing python 2.7

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,480
from the archive would be a good idea

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:08,160
we can make a plan um look

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,680
that plan might be there's a python 2.7

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
source package or something in the

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,399
archive that it can build a 2.7 from c

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,320
during the builds and

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
there are options um

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
i'm not currently i'm not just depending

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
on the

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,519
interpreter i'm also trying to keep a

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,680
virtual end stack alive

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,839
so that you can because we don't have

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
any

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,040
modules in the archive anymore we did a

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,680
big removal there

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,959
so it's only really useful to you as a

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:45,839
user if you have

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:45,839
a working virtual envelope

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,480
so yeah that's a couple of packages it's

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,519
virtual lens and it's all the pip wheels

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,440
and they're getting more and more

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,160
difficult to keep working on 2.7 because

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,839
upstream is

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,839
moving forward

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,000
i think that's kind of it for the python

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,680
2 lubrication

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,760
topic i don't know if anybody else wants

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,560
to contribute anything before we move on

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
to the next one

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,079
all right so the next one um

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,199
that one was created by me uh and it's

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,759
about merging the

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,000
python duplication team and the debian

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,199
python modules team together

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,800
um i've

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,959
been talking about this on the uh the

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
python list for a while now i think i

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,480
started

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,040
discussing it in november 2019

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
um i find the divide between the two

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,160
teams very

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
artificial because we're basically doing

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,600
the same thing

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,000
using the same policy but at the moment

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,120
we're having twice the documentation

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,920
people have to ask twice to have uh to

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,759
be part of the different salsa groups

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,440
and i feel it's a lot of work for

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,040
basically nothing the the python

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
application teams policies and

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,000
documentation

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,600
is lacking behind because nobody keeps

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,240
it up to date with the

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,759
the libraries one so i just i just don't

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,759
understand why it is only

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:23,839
why there's two team and not one and why

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,839
we shouldn't merge them

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,839
yeah personally i think it'd be nice if

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
you can immerse them

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
uh because of exactly the same reasons

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,680
uh you mentioned

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,440
uh they're like lots of duplicate

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,240
requests and stuff and

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,240
we can get rid of them and it's also a

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,160
bit of a bit more manual work

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
so i think it'll be nice very nice it

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,639
can merge where to

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,639
merge these two together

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,839
we will keep the same path for

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,839
applications right

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,120
i mean the plan is not to move around

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,279
the repositories

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,160
and change the urls and whatever right

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,160
yeah yeah

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,439
we don't want to do that but maybe we

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,120
can just um

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,760
merge them in a way that you know you

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,280
don't need to um

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,880
ask for requests in like uh twice

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,000
right um and maybe document some of the

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,640
documentation

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
uh differs from the two teams so maybe

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
we can just

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,880
uh keep it united and un under the same

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,919
place

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,120
so it's like uh

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,480
at the same place for both the uh

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,720
teams yeah submerge the team

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,520
meds the documentation keep the sub

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,160
projects on salsa separate as they are

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,360
i guess that's a summary we can also

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,760
merge the uh

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,840
the sub projects on salsa too so takes

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,039
care of directing everything

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,840
by itself and i'm probably not sure i

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,240
see the point of

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,919
having these two it will break them

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
check out for people who want to use

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,679
that

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,160
on existing packages right um

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,280
vcs fields would go quickly and there'll

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,720
be like lots of

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,080
lots of uh offenses there uh

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,120
you can see on tracker so either we do

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,400
mass commit

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,400
uh doing that changes in the vcs field

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,960
and then merge probably that's that's a

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,960
good idea

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
or maybe find an alternative or

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,360
something

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,880
so if i believe if we decide to move

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,679
packages from the the

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,000
urls of packages it won't be a problem

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,880
for

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,520
that checkout because uh salsa is made

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,200
in order so that it doesn't break

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,360
i don't know there's no directions or

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,840
whatever

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,720
there's automated redirections yes do

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,200
they work for

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,960
get checkouts as well or just browsers

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,120
they work for git checkouts too and then

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,280
when you're cloning a repository

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
there's a little snippet and they get a

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,120
message it appears saying oh

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,799
uh this euro has changed don't forget to

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,640
change your things on your local

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,240
configuration blah blah blah blah cool

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
but are we talking about breaking dead

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
checkouts for people in stable

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,880
because i would i would recommend to

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,760
just go um i mean to do the mass

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,240
change in sync from the packaging and on

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,240
salsa

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,840
there's a bunch of packages and stable

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
that's still pointed alley off

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,440
yeah well i guess

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:37,600
the message um

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,080
i cannot clone if the package is moved

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,880
to another place i cannot move i cannot

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,799
clone it

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,000
with the same url it shows me that the

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,520
namespace you're looking

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,600
for cannot be found that is

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
a fatal error could not read the emotion

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,240
positively so

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,679
maybe seven i think that depends on how

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,200
how long the the package has been how

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
how much time it has had been since the

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,280
package has been uh moved i think

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,039
the redirection only works for a

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
definite amount of time

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
so if it's well the package that i'm

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,080
trying on is uh

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
is not more than two days old so

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,320
well anyway i i don't think it's it's

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,480
really important that

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,559
sort of the path we can work on that

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,320
later but mostly

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,440
this has been i've been pushing for it

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,720
for a while and it's mostly been

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,799
uh not moving because nobody

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
none of the admins actually have decided

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,039
to take that they were interested in

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,320
this topic at all

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,600
and i think it's been affecting a bunch

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
of people so i don't know how to move

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,240
forward

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,039
uh i've created a new uh

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,640
a new team on tracker for us to move to

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
the python team because at the moment

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,000
there's two

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,360
teams on tracker that deviantart but i'd

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,880
be interested in knowing how

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,880
we can move forward on this issue

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,280
what what does doco think about it on

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,760
pjrt

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,120
did you talk to them so this isn't a

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,159
doco thing really

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,640
this is the the teams have admins pyotr

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,720
is definitely an important part of that

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,440
uh he hear another admin here you're

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
keeping quiet

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
very quietly hi

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,840
i didn't know i was an admin of this but

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
yeah

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,919
i mean for what my admin rights are

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,600
concerned if you ask me to do something

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,240
that the team agrees on i won't stand in

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,840
the way

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,840
so don't take this as a blocker

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,520
to it too yeah

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,039
i would say the thing that stopped us

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,240
from happening is that the admins

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,600
haven't got together and

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
tried to have a conversation about it

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
the admins have been very reactive

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,039
rather than

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,039
proactive

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,000
i know there are people in the team who

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,840
don't like the proposal

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,840
but they aren't here today

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,640
well it's it needs a plan and someone

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,559
driving the plan with states

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,600
through to conclusion and yeah we cannot

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,720
we cannot decide now but we can agree to

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,720
have a plan move forward

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,640
okay yeah i really did an issue on salsa

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,960
a while ago

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,240
documented every steps we need to take

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,159
and what's blocking

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,559
i did a bunch of work i created a merge

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,039
request to change the policies and

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,120
update the documentation and all that's

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,640
needed now is actually somebody deciding

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,640
that we're actually doing this and like

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,280
company

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,799
i would say you have core you have

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,600
agreements from the people here

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,919
if we consider that to be corum then we

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,919
do it

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,159
yeah i think it's better suited i mean

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,679
this discussion is better suited for a

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
meeting list and maybe we can move on

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,360
with the other parts

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,360
um

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,840
yeah i agree you should take this to the

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,880
main list and get

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,480
bigger agreement than this meeting and

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
empire i think at one point you have to

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
say if there's no objections you just go

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,799
ahead with it

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,360
because otherwise if you just wait for

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,400
wait forever it will just go nowhere

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,559
yeah that could work

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,320
because we discussed this in the buff

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,720
and we're going to take these actions

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,320
if no one has any complaint then we'll

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,080
move forward

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,760
at this date and it should be fine

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,840
agree so i'll send another mailing

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,039
link i sent another message on the

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,480
mailing list

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,559
i've done it before uh but i can i can

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,400
set up an arbitrary date saying

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,000
if nobody objects we can go forward but

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,279
i don't have any power to do it

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,279
so sorry i cannot commit anything

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,960
because i'm not in the bin but i will

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
and what i hear from this buff is that

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,600
nobody strongly disagrees about this and

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,840
a bunch of people kind of agree

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,960
well you need to buy in from some admin

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,000
then

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,000
we do we have to do it

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,840
yeah he said he's willing to do anything

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,640
we want as long as we agree he

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,440
disappeared and then

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
what am i that mean

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
sorry did he

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,760
i'm not sure what i'm supposed to be

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,000
admitted off

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,039
did i just remember and incorrectly

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,279
blame you for that sorry i thought

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,840
you're one of the admin

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,840
uh i forget who the team is

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,840
i mean yes and scott

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,880
yeah i see at least stefano on the

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,720
debian

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,919
python team papt sorry i didn't mean to

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,670
put you into that

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,729
uh

00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,729
[Music]

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,080
i am an admin yeah i'm like a baby admin

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,320
though i go

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,600
i got access relatively recently

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,240
compared to the others have been doing

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
this forever

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,480
your admin of the two groups i think

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,120
only

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,080
and one other person are i mean of the

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,640
global but

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,600
python team thing and scope yeah

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,279
but the thing i was trying to do now is

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,480
make stefano admin but you're already i

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:45,440
mean and i'm not so it's fine

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,039
all right great so we can move on to the

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,440
other topic which is

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,679
any other business and the first point

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,600
is uh outstanding bugs in the dh fighter

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,720
i think stefano do you put that in the

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,080
uh

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,080
i had berkeley asked me if i could put

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,039
that in but pyotr isn't here and i think

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,840
he was trying to prod

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,720
pyotr so no point there i want to go

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,200
back to

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,440
captain dpmc for a moment um there are

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,120
some policy differences between the two

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,080
and if we merge we probably have to deal

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,080
with them um

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,679
the pap 20 uses depth 10 branches

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,039
everywhere where

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,840
dpmt doesn't that's chain

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,880
that's a bigger change for consumers

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,880
than

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,880
urls probably or maybe equal level

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,320
would you want to push through on

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,840
normalizing um

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,840
branch scheme

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,120
i thought it was the case from the dpmt2

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:53,840
dpmt tends to use master

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,840
papt tends to use debian slash master

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,480
at least with so we did the bulk import

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,840
of vpnt first

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,440
and it was imported as master but then i

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,880
think scott raised the question

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,880
on the mailing list and he wanted

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,919
somebody to go through the old ones that

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,000
hadn't been

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,520
moved to demon slash master in the

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,360
library's

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,200
team and actually do it i think if you

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,720
read the policy it actually tells you to

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,960
use the uh

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,880
the diva slash master thing so we should

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,799
be pushing through on all of them then

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,559
yeah but i think it just makes sense to

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,039
have one common policy and think this is

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,120
the whole

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,320
point of this thing not to have

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:35,039
different ways of

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,679
doing python packages yeah precisely if

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,240
i do

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,480
a packet from dpmt i'm doing something

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,600
else if i'm doing a package from pat i'm

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,240
doing something else

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,799
it's a bit confusing so i say yes i

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,320
agree

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:52,720
that you know merging

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,720
i think would be a great idea really

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,720
i think there is going to be you want to

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
delete this topic i think there is going

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,320
to be push back on the list

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,919
um and i don't know how you want to deal

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,039
with that beyond saying we agreed in the

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,039
buff that we want to do this

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,799
from what i heard the only person who

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,640
who wasn't

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,399
stoked on it was uh scott i think scott

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,320
wasn't didn't think it was a good idea

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,640
but didn't give any

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,679
anything and just didn't reply a lot so

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,840
i don't know

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,840
okay so what just does it anyway then

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:45,840
should move on

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:55,440
the plan for python 3.9

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,640
if i remember well what doku wrote about

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,600
is to have it uploaded

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,600
just before the freeze

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
right

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,000
am i the only one reading the mailing

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,679
list

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
i remember reading something along those

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,000
lines somewhere i can't remember if it

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,640
was an rsc

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,760
on a mailing list but also my memory is

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,840
unreliable

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,840
last well so maybe

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,840
what's a mailing list again

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,440
so do you mind to remind me when is the

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,159
phrase again is it by the

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,720
end of the year beginning of next year

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,720
and so

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,840
if i remember now i think i remember a

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,679
bit clearer

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,440
he said he would upload 3.9 to sid

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:17,440
then we would have two interpreter for

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,799
up to novem end of november beginning of

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,279
december

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,000
and then we decide if it's visible to

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,039
keep python

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,039
3.9 or or

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,039
payton or we stay on 3.8

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,279
so that that was the the the plan he

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
drone

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,520
but i don't think we can know in advance

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,679
what's going to happen

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,200
like is it going to break the world and

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,120
and i think that he wanted to address

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,679
that

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,520
i think the idea was to upload 3.9 as

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,679
soon as possible to be able to give us

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,399
time to see what happens to the archive

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,039
with

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,480
a 3.9 and see if we can actually use

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,440
that as a default

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,440
for the next release

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,200
which makes sense because anyway if we

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,159
hit bugs we need to fix them

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,159
whatever happens so

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,200
we already have python 3.9 i don't know

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,200
if someone has done some

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
testing

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,000
i mean we have like a release candidate

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,000
one

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,519
um looker usually does some rebuild

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,919
testing

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,919
with it

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,880
i don't remember him mentioning anything

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,880
about it though

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,559
maybe he's waiting for the releasing in

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,039
september

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,039
and then do the reveal

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,440
but i don't know if

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,840
he needs help or he wants to do it on

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,840
his own

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,840
i can't see anything

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,960
yeah so about that email uh address for

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,679
maintainer

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,760
on on the pad so did we even talk about

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,760
it on the mailing list

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,799
i think it was mostly the uh the merge

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,720
requests i created

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,919
for the verge between the pipt and the

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,240
dmpt

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,000
uh i think it just makes sense to move

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,000
on to the next to the tracker

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,519
the python team tracker.org

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,720
email since alia doesn't exist anymore

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,080
anyway

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,840
we're going to need something new that

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:56,559
isn't either the pap

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:58,559
or the mpt

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,559
again i'll be summarizing that in the

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,880
email i sent to the mailing list to try

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,279
to

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,279
rekindle the uh merge discussion

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,559
i used to follow those lists but they

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,000
got so noisy and spammy that i stopped

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,440
paying any attention to them

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,440
i assume that's most people

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,799
yes i have the same experience with some

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,279
[Music]

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,720
packages on the openstack team and like

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,480
like this like

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,320
99 percent of this spam yeah

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,919
i think scott actually follows them

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,399
because sometimes he replies

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,080
and tells people they've forgotten to

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:53,840
push a git tag or

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:53,840
that kind of stuff so

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,039
i think that's it for the uh any other

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
business

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,080
uh topic i don't know if anybody else

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,399
wanted to talk

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,120
about any any other business before we

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,519
move on to

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,760
the reminder of the python sprint and we

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,639
close the session

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,760
yes so is there anything planned for

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,760
that sprint in fact

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,679
not really i think the idea for the

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,119
sprint is mainly

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,879
to have a common moment where we can

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,879
work on stuff and uh

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,320
to have a moment to where we can sponsor

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,440
requests maybe

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,560
uh i think there's a bunch of uh looking

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,040
at the rc

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,800
topic there's a bunch of requests that

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,800
needs to be sponsored

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,240
uh so it could be just a comment a

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,440
common moment to

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,760
be working on thing uh maybe have a look

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,040
uh

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:49,839
more closely in the pi to keep packages

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,839
see what's the deal with that

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,679
and i wanted to talk about some process

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,760
processes

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,440
around sponsoring but you said we'll do

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,359
that in the sprint then

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,119
we've got time now oh if you want to

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,560
talk about processes for the

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,680
the sponsoring we can do it now i

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,160
thought you would you wanted to take

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,040
some time to actually do sponsors

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,040
that would be silly

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,359
yeah so sometimes when i try to sponsor

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,119
something from the topic

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,200
i noticed it's already been uploaded

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,119
when i tried to upload it and then i

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,720
find out that it was added by the to the

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,839
topic because it was

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,440
an rfs from another source and the

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,520
person who wanted it sponsored isn't

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,359
necessarily even on the rsc so no one

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,000
removes it again from rsc

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,800
once it is uploaded and that causes some

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,079
extra work

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,839
and sometimes confusion and i think we

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,040
need some better way to handle that or

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,720
some better rules that

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,720
if you want something added to the topic

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,000
you should at least be willing to remove

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,960
it when it's uploaded

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,320
or be available in the channel to answer

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,320
some questions whenever needed

00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,920
one of the issues i've seen is sometimes

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,480
there's so many requests

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,839
that the the topic length is not long

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,599
enough

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,760
so i don't know if we would if we should

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,400
actually try to be moving

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,560
from using the rfc topic for that uh

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,160
maybe rc is not the most

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,800
uh most familiar space for most people

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,160
to be trying to covet the team and the

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,760
request sponsoring

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,200
i know we've been trying to use the wiki

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,240
for a while there's been like the wiki

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,839
the mailing list and

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,520
the irc where people can ask for

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,240
sponsorship maybe it would be a good

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,960
idea to have

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,160
only one common place where you can keep

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,280
it keep an eye on

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,280
them that's true although the topic is

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,320
very convenient because it's kind of

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,160
always easy to access and always there

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,160
and we'll gain some space in the topic

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:55,440
space because the teams will merge and

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:57,280
then there's extra eight bytes or so

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,960
um i think what i'll do tomorrow as part

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,720
of the sprint is just try to write up

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,000
some guidelines then for

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,920
for what happens when you want to put

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,320
your package in the rsc topic and then

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,839
we can take it from there

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,599
i think it should be part of policy

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,320
maybe people need to read

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,599
anyway and agree to it and um as we've

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,720
agreed on

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,520
earlier in 2019 if you want to propose a

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,400
change to

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,839
the policy what you can do is uh bring

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,119
the topic on the mailing list

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,359
and then submit a merge request uh on

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,280
on the policy documentation on salsa and

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,680
if nobody disagrees in 10 days

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
then the admin is version that sounds

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,839
good yeah

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,839
let's make it part of policy

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:50,160
yeah that's all i entered in for any

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:52,560
other business

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,079
well there's a sprint tomorrow uh if you

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,040
want to drop in and you have some times

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,520
to work on the

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,280
updating your packages or working in the

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,880
pipe to keep ones and see if we can if

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,200
we could remove them

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,440
uh maybe working policy or whatever

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,880
sponsoring requests

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,320
so have a look at the the sprint wiki

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,359
that i

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,040
run a draft on and uh if possible keep a

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,760
track of what you've done during this

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,839
print

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,520
in the ether pad so we can have a sprint

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,000
report

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,200
reports are always cool to see what

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,920
teams are alive and

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,839
do work but i think that's about it if

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,720
nobody else wants to bring any topic i

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,720
think we can close
