### An experiment about personalized front-end of bugs.debian.org

Debian has a bug tracking system and bugs.debian.org is a key infrastructure for Debian project.
It tracks many reports and the bug number is assigned to each reports.
You can view such a report via https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=NNNNNN.

This bug tracking mechanism is working well for a long time.
It is very cool but it may be not friendly for newcomers.

#### Target audience

* Debian contributor or maintainer who want to fix bugs not only the bugs which
is related to maintained packages by you

It may not interesting for Debian developer because DD is already familiar with bugs.debian.org, udd.debian.org, or qa.debian.org.

#### What will talk about

In this session, Iâ€™ll talk about one experiment about Debian's bug tracking mechanism.
It is constructed on traditional E-mail archives and simple front-end for it.
