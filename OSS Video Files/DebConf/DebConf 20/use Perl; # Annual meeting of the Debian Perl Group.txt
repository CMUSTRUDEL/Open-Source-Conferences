00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,599
annual meeting for the pro team

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,719

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,399
okay so we have a pad for the

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,480
with the agenda and we

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
are going to take notes so btn is going

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
to take notes

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
could be perfect if someone could

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,039
monitor

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,399
the irc channel normally people should

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,920
talk in debian peril on ftc

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,559
but the normal

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
channel for talks is fine too but we

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,000
need someone to monitor the channels

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,799
would anyone take care of that

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,799

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,320
today

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,080
hi i'm etienne moliere i joined the

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,440
pearl team only very

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,639
recently and i

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,919
mostly integrated some dependencies

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,840
for debian map packages into

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
the debian pearl team

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:11,840
yay new members

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,360
okay anyone else

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,840
and if not that's fine

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,520
okay well uh i guess that's it but i

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,520
mean that does not prevent you to

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
speak if you want later

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,240
no problem uh

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,360
so well our first uh item

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,520
on the agenda is uh as usual the

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,720
team status so we have some stats

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,520
maybe i let gregor

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
tell us about it

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,600
yeah so each year we look at

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,280
some numbers for the team to get a

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,000
feeling

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,880
about how we're doing you can find the

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,160
link in the

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,720
in the pad it's in the wicked statistics

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,120
page i've updated those numbers for the

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,759
last year on i don't know friday or

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,000
saturday or something

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,960
so the first list of numbers is the

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,960
git activity so the number of persons

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
who did at least one commit in the last

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,039
year and the number of persons

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,880
with a hundred or more commits

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,680
so that was 52 persons with at least

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,440
one commit and 10 i think in the

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,199
meantime 11

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:55,919
because i took the numbers on friday

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:58,479
so 11 persons with more than 100 commits

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,720
so if you have the page open and look on

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,840
it you will see that

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
both numbers are

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,319
well in the range of the numbers we had

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,360
before

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,919
but a bit on the on the lower

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,039
end of the of the range

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,840
below the average it's below average

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,840
exactly yeah

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,319
okay the other statistics

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,960
is about the low hanging fruit sessions

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,240
that's the meetings we have once a month

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,080
on

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,160
irc to well to spend the time together

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,360
and work on

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,199
easy but tedious tasks

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,680
and there's a lot of numbers

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,039
um number of sessions average number of

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,560
participants unique

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,879
participants how often one person

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,960
participates on average and and their

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,639
range

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,639
so if we look at the

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,080
development here the number of sessions

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:15,599
is more or less the same over the years

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,800
number of participants and and unique

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,120
particular average

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,879
participants and unique participants was

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,960
the highest in

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:28,160
2015 16 or 16 17 in this

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,319
bit going down since then so the recent

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,320
numbers are

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,440
well also in the range we've had before

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
but towards the

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,719
lower end of the range

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
okay so these were the numbers why are

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,599
we looking at them

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
together feeling about how we are we are

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,440
doing

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,800
as a team so what do you guys

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,040
think is there anything we can read from

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,399
those numbers is there anything we have

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,279
to

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,279
consider or do

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,560
well i think that uh yeah it's

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,120
decreasing a bit but not

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
dropping completely which is a bit

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,839
reassuring

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,440
so what i see is that well uh i

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,120
i know that this year it was a bit

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
difficult for me to attend

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
lhf and most of the time i was just

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,800
saying hello and

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,800
not doing much but

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:32,080
at least there was often

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,720
people joining and often

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,959
new people or people that did not join

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
for a while so i think the

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,959
what's not shown in the number is that

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,360
there's there is a rotation i mean there

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,519
are

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,800
the usual suspects that are always here

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,320
and you're one

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,800
gregor but

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,160
even when you're not stuff can happen

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,160
and i think that's a good sign

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,839
well maybe it's my optimism talking but

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,320
i

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,560
prefer to see that as a good time but

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,560
yeah

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,720
we've been every year we've been

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
thinking okay well maybe

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,200
the time uh is uh

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
the time it happens is the issue or

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,079
maybe

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,040
there is uh something so what happens is

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
that

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,040
the time changes everyone steppen it

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,240
happens on the 21st

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,279
every month and it's uh

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,279
one month at 17 utc

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,600
and another month at 19 utc to try to

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,160
help a bit with the time zone difference

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,320
well so far that has mostly worked for

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:47,839
me but i mean if

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,839
anyone wants to chime in

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
i mean i'm only uh commenting from the

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,720
perspective of someone who doesn't

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,959
usually make it but that's not for time

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,200
that's not for the time of day reasons

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,200
and

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,279
i'd like to i'd like to get back into

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,079
more active

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,079
participation

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,440
it's possible that we could um turn it

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,120
into something that's a bit more

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,600
interactive so we're all getting more

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,160
and more used to video calls for example

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,399
so maybe there's an opportunity to

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,800
evolve how it works a bit

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:36,640
we also have um experience from the um

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,839
the sprint we had as well related

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,079
yeah yeah we exactly i think we

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,000
even we talked about that possibility

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,920
during the sprint

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,040
i think it's a nice idea maybe not every

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,560
time but i mean

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,720
if there's more than two or three people

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,920
we can just say okay well let's

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,240
set up a video call on debian gt

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:01,519
or even on meteogt.org it could be nice

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,839
i think it's something we can do as a

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,480
you can decide on every time just maybe

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:11,839
set up a room somewhere and

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,839
use it for something more interactive

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,360
yeah i agree with this video idea when

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,440
we actually have moved to the next point

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,560
which is the future of the

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
lhf sessions

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:35,519
so i think we can uh take a note that

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,720
this additional video might be nice

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,560
the other thing is do we want to

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,880
continue the lhf

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,160
sessions probably yes

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,480
unless there's a lot of protest do we

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,240
want to change the time so do we want to

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,800
keep this monthly 21st elton

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,800
alternating between 17 and 19 utc

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,480
well for me so far the re when i could

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
not attend it was generally not because

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,880
of the time

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,360
but because of the day and uh it was

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,440
this year it was mostly bad luck because

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,600
the day of the week it would happen

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
was often something where i already had

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,639
something planned

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,480
so for me let's keep it that way and

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,800
i guess it would work better next year

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
for me

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,519
well in my case is the time of day which

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,760
is in the middle of the night usually

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,639
but i don't see how that can be improved

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,639
because i guess

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,000
um you people can't attend when you're

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,240
working actually

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,839
so uh that's just me

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,720
well i think we might want to try to

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,760
maybe i have a wider difference i mean

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,639
i'm

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,279
okay with that i mean uh nowadays uh

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,360
well i'm

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,320
self-employed and that's the time it's

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,839
not a problem

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,680
if it's not the middle of the night so

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
well for me a time like this would be

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
best actually

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,240
i don't know if that's compatible with

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,519
your work skill if it's in the middle of

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,839
the week

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,839
like on a thursday or something

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,560
well not for me but there are other

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,000
times when i

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,600
can't make it so if we add some earlier

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
times that's okay for me

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,959
it's not that important really i'm i

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,880
wouldn't know if i could make it then

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,440
if it's just me i don't think it makes

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,440
much sense

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
okay so maybe we can send this

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,079
suggestion

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,560
on the mailing list afterwards for the

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,440
report and

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
gather salt here i mean we are just a

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
small

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,160
number of people and maybe some number

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,440
of the teams that could not make it to

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,120
the uh to the both

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,600
and uh that usually can't make it to the

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,560
nhf uh maybe the they would be

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,360
interested so

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,240
uh i think we're yeah let's uh let's put

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
the

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
object on the mailing list and see if

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,000
there's something that comes up

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,680
what do you think yeah good idea maybe

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:41,839
people from the us

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,839
west coast somewhere yeah

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
anyone else on the electric future on

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,279
this suggestion of

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,519
having the discussion on the mailing

00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
list

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,399
um i just thought how about making some

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,519
of the sessions a little bit more

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,160
specific

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,759
i think now we mostly have uh similar

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,880
topics every time

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,560
and maybe if people like said the day or

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,720
two in advance okay why not

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,680
pick this one and work specifically on

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,440
on this

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,440
might be more interesting for people to

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
to make an effort and be there and

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
join in

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
yeah i mean normally there's an agenda

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
and

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,680
it's with which is

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,240
just the wiki page and that

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,720
a link is sent along with a calendar

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,560
invitation but it's true that we've

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,079
we have not been very good at uh

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,120
proposing other stuffs and uh

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:57,680
just you know the usual uh

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,680
upstream uh update and

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,519
working on two links and stuff like that

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,240
but we

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,839
i mean if anyone has suggestion on oh

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
yeah well it would be nice to do that

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
but i don't want to work on that alone

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,000
let's

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,679
well why why don't we do that

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,240
during your lhf or something i mean i

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,079
i'd be happy to

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,439
to do something like that myself you

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,439
know that's a good idea

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,199
yeah me too i think it's a good idea the

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,400
question is just

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,720
uh where does these topics come from so

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,280
as nolan said if someone

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,840
proposes a topic i think that's an

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,080
excellent

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,080
idea to work a bit more focused

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,640
well i wanted to talk about making it

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,880
more interactive

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
but i'll just do it on the mailing list

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,280
so that's um

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,840
you know available in the wider public

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,520
to

00:17:49,840 --> 00:18:00,640
you know jam in their their opinions so

00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:03,280
i just posted the mailing lists

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,799
i mean all right that's easy to just

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,280
whenever we have the

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,840
reminder on the mailing list we could uh

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,000
maybe

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
just uh maybe add something to the

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,039
reminder like that

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,400
please uh add your topic and propose

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,000
topics

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
by replying the email or something

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,280
and the same for the interactive

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,640
thing that crash was

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,880
well great we have plans in in general i

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,600
like the

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,440
interactive idea because sometimes i

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,480
just lost when i look at the

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,640
list of things to do in like the lhs

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:57,840
lhf summary or ideas and it's just like

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:57,840
i just can get started sometimes

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,840
okay shall we continue yeah

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,440
just have a comment from bremner that

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,720
say that we should not defer

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,559
everything to the mailing list and be

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,240
brave but yes

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,720
let's continue so sprint

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,360
we had the sprint this year in may

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,200
woohoo

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,240
that was not to be taken for granted it

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
should have

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,360
initially happened in person but of

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,880
course

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,360
it did not but we

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,160
had the opportunity to test this cheat

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,360
set at them

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,600
and well for me

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,480
it worked quite well it was nice to see

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,480
familiar faces and familiar faces

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,200
to just you know do stuff together

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,760
of course not as nice as a as an

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,559
in-person meeting

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,840
always more complicated for immersion

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,919
because well we

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,400
when we're at home we also have more

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,240
solicitation for other stuff

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,360
but i mean in my opinion

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,919
it's something that we

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,280
as we were saying we should do more

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,760
often evening

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,960
it's much easier to set up an in-person

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,679
meeting

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
i really hope we can have in-person

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,039
meeting

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,799
again soon because that's much nicer but

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,919
yeah so the lhf is one

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,559
way to do that but we

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,559
might want to

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,880
do stuff in this area because ourselves

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,159
are there any topics we want to

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,880
specifically discuss

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,880
what came out of the sprint i think most

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,520
mostly it's covered elsewhere

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
in the agenda

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,640
yeah i think there's a report and some

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,320
things

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,600
are going to come up we

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,320
might want to decide or at least think

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,799
about

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,720
when to if and when and how to have a

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,280
next sprint

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,159
i agree with um no lance that this was a

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,280
nice experience

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,799
and i think the others who were there

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,799
also came to this conclusion so

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,080
what do you think about doing something

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:31,520
similar in

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:34,720
uh in autumn so not on hemisphere

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,679
uh autumn in the in

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,760
this style like from friday to friday

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,360
evening to sunday noon with two or three

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,240
gt meetings and working between

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,240
yeah that could work

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,600
i see thumbs up from several people

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,440
okay and i guess for the exact dates we

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,840
will go to the

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
mailing list right

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,360
so next topic uh

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,760
anything to discuss from the

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,880
both last year i mean there's a list of

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,200
things here do we want to talk about

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,200
them all

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,679
so these are the things where we said

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,400
last year that we will talk about them

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,400
this year but it doesn't mean that we

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,960
can't change the order so maybe it would

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,720
make more sense to start with pearl 5

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,320
532 and pearl 7 because that's more

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:46,960
uh origin and then see how far we

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,960
can get in those other items

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,159
sure uh i'm just noting there's at least

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,200
one item that was added to the

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,640
dev 19 list recently that

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:03,200
we may want to talk about the mpel topic

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:07,120
um but i i can report briefly on

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,840
the 532 transition um

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,200
like a lot of the new upstream releases

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,840
in the past few years it's

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,240
been very reasonably stable and not a

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,600
lot of breakage so that's good news

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,720
um the main blocker at the moment

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,000
is pearl tk

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,320
which um

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,400
builds successfully but is as far as i

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,039
understand basically broken

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,200
um possibly because of the some or all

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,400
of the test suite is disabled

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,640
um so i've reached out to a couple of

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,200
occasions to the maintainer who's not

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,919
who's not uh responding so far so it

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
might be

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,720
if someone has some bandwidth to take a

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,559
look at what it would take to

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,919
bring it in line with upstream um

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:59,600
so the the upstream pearl tk

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,919
package has fixed the problem so it's

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,400
whether we want to do a targeted fix for

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,919
compatibility or whether we want to

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
update the package to the new app stream

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,000
release that sort of thing

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,200
um i mean i had a brief look at the

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,720
at the back there is a commit upstream

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,039
which fixes

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,520
just this problem but it's still quite

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,240
huge and it's in xs and so it didn't

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,880
really look

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,679
further but if this is a blocker for

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,240
pearls

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,840
uh for 32 then probably someone has to

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,520
enemy it

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,760
yeah i mean my preference if we did

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,840
tough to nmu would actually be to

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
do a new up to enemy the new upstream

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,039
release

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,600
um it's not what particularly was uh 532

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,480
broke

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,559
uh with respect to tk this is i hadn't

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,200
heard about that

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,400
uh i forget the details off the top of

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
my head there's a series of

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,919
six or so commits um in the upstream

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,080
made in the upstream

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
tree in back in february to fix various

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,120
things

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,559
um i mean the delta is about 500 lines

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,000
between what's currently in debian in

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,120
the current upstream release

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,120
so it's not enormous

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,559
that actually sounds pretty big i i

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,480
wasn't aware of anything that

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,279
controversial other than

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,840
um mark lehmann's uh one of his modules

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,840
got broken

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,120
the delta is not entirely to do with

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,720
532.

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,720
uh okay yeah

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,080
it's just a question if there's no one

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,520
here who probably

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,320
has the ability to cherry pick fixes

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,320
into that package

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,120
anyway um

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,880
damash and me just pasted the same back

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
to the chitsy chat so you can get from

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
the

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,080
debian back to the upstream back as well

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,960
yeah

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,960
i'm clicking through to it now thanks um

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,720
yeah so my suggestion would be to uh to

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
give

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,559
colin that the current debbie maintainer

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,679
another week or so to respond and then

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,120
we

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:11,360
uh yeah then we enemy

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,000
in somewhere else

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,760
um i did file the um transition tracking

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,559
bug with the release team

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,880
um this is the release we will want to

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,919
have

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,279
in bullseye so uh

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,559
we need to get this moving at some

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,159
speed uh the freeze

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,520
that applies to pearl will be in january

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,520
so um

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,120
but we have time so that's basically in

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,400
progress

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,039
the other thing right into that

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,120
transition

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,240
is fixing the ipv6 build failures

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,200
because that will slow down the

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,480
transition quite a bit um

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:57,600
right now that's just waiting for

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,840
me to upload the patch to i o socket ip

00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,840
um

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,480
so for you what surprises me about it

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,400
about this bug is that upstream is not

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,960
responding in the upstream is

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,080
is paul evans who is very active all

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,440
around

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,480
yeah yeah that's true um

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
on the other hand uh as nico and i

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,520
discussed at the weekend

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,320
this problem is not really

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,440
down to i socket ip it appears to be a

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,039
flaw in

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,360
lipsy g lipsy so

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,720
it's a from the perspective of pearl it

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
looks like more of a workaround than

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,960
anything else but i think it's the

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,559
the right approach for now um there is a

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
bug in there is a bug in geolipsey

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,279
reported

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:52,559
and um linked in that thread as well

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,320
but yeah i don't i don't know whether it

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,000
might be such a niche case that it's

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,520
really only affecting debian at this

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,930
point

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,019
um

00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,019
[Music]

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,080
so there we go

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,919
um i'm actually going to be meeting him

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,679
with paul in about 30 minutes

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,760
okay well if you can uh ask him

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,279
uh what he thinks about this bug uh that

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,279
would be great i'll just paste it

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,840
hang on i'll paste it into the chat in a

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
sec

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
um

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,720
so that's that's all i had about 5 32 at

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,720
this point

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,080
okay thanks

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,600
well well maybe you can help at some

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,120
point after

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,919
above to make the notes clearer because

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,880
uh yeah we've been struggling a bit to

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,279
put all the information but so far i

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,039
think we're fine

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,039
oh and pearl 7 maybe

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,960
yeah so i guess that's me as well

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,600
so i posted to the debian pearl list in

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,240
back in june just

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,799
uh forwarding an announcement from it

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,840
was made on the firefight porter's list

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:28,720
about pearl 7 which is a initiative

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:32,080
to make some

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,120
to modernize it's basically an evolution

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,640
of pearl 5

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,559
with better sort of modern defaults

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,440
um which is going to be a breaking

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,960
change for lots and lots of

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,720
stuff now this i'm

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,559
pretty vague because this is a very

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,159
fast-moving topic and i don't

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,480
really have the complete picture right

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,320
now um i think it's fair to say that

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,320
there's been a lot of discussion about

00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,159
what the right approach is

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,960
amongst the pearl five community um

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,200
and but i want to make sure that people

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,320
are

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,480
aware of it because it does have the it

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,679
does have the uh

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,960
implication of potentially supporting

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,320
more than one version of pearl and

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,200
debian

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,000
um which is a big will be a big change

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,760
to a big

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,120
well be a big imposition on the way we

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,480
currently have things

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,360
running that's actually been a topic

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,520
that's come up

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,320
multiple times the question is

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,039
well one of the assumptions is is

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,640
distros

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,240
are pretty used to php and

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,679
in python having multiple versions

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,720
and it shouldn't be any problem for

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,880
debian to track a

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,159
kind of static 532 versus a

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,200
a uh moving pearl seven target

00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:01,039
uh would you say that's that's uh an

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,000
unders not accurate uh

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,440
so i mean i've fed back on this topic a

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,919
couple of times but

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,919
i think it's

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,559
i mean it's a it's a lot of work to

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,480
migrate not so much the interpret

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,600
well the interpreter is one thing the

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,840
the kind of ecosystem

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,840
around it is a much bigger deal um

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,480
we need we need to come up with tooling

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,799
i think compared to php and python we

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
have a

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,559
much bigger footprint i don't actually

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,559
have a good sense of the numbers but

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,640
it's painful it's painful for python and

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,760
i think it will be the more painful

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,760
it's my so it short summary so

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,919
a lot of the approaches that we're

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,720
discussing are

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,559
things that would make it so that uh

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,559
even if there were two

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,840
then um the packages or or the cpan

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,200
modules

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,600
uh that you guys would build for 532

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,720
should be relatively identical to what

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,799
you build for

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,559
seven meaning you could maintain the

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,760
same patch set

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,840
uh nothing you patch for pearl seven

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,159
um like almost everything you patch for

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,279
pearl seven should work just fine on 532

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
also

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,320
um it sounds like that doesn't really

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,519
solve the problem but that that is one

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,600
thing that is

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,720
we're trying to do the other thing we

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,880
have a question

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,240
about and i don't know if you can answer

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,000
that is

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:31,440
um what about the weird corner cases

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,640
like uh postgres uses pearl in a

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,679
kind of buried hidden place and

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,440
and we're not actually sure how many of

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,480
those sort of uh integrated uh pearl

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,559
um things that uh exist uh

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,320
and that it would be good for us to look

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,320
at before

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,120
uh we move along too far yeah i mean i

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,240
so first grade is one example there but

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,080
that's just

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,360
you know things that use pearl that are

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,760
not part of cpan

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,360
whether or not they whether or not they

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,880
embed the interpreter

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,960
or not um is a big

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,200
somewhat unknown unknown space i mean we

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,159
we build the archive across

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,840
i think we have something like 3000 cpa

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
modules and probably twice the number of

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,480
packages which we think useful in some

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,960
way so

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,799
and those other other set of packages

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,000
are more difficult to

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,000
analyze at the moment um

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,679
so i didn't hear that i was asking so

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,120
those are not well tracked

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,640
if i ask the question um what packages

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,720
other than the cpan modules use perl

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,080
could we would that be an answer role

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,640
question

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,720
uh it's partially answerable um but perl

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,679
is part of the base system in debian so

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,240
potentially any

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,240
gender canon probably is using it in

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,720
some way even if it's only for maintain

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,519
packaging infrastructure so this is like

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,760
uh

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,200
cpan modules do a bad job of declaring

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,240
that they use carp

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,000
so if we ever broke carp out of core you

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,000
wouldn't have any clue how many modules

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,119
would break without actually searching

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,119
in the modules

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,879
yeah so i'm uh

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,399
i think we could quite easily spend the

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,520
rest of the meeting talking about pearls

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,359
of it and then i'm a bit

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,000
confused there are probably other topics

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,040
as well um but todd i am i'm

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,839
somewhat involved now in the in the call

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,599
discussions

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,599
um so i will try and

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,679
keep kind of keep talking um i haven't

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,320
had a lot of time to

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,040
myself to look into what's been going on

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,040
in recent months

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,480
yeah well thank you but yeah we we have

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,919
five minutes until the end of the

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,320
meeting so i think we should move along

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,320
but

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,839
that's a really important topic and i

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,440
think we should

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,760
uh keep that in mind and keep discussing

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,440
it

00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,880
uh so yeah some thanks them for

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,599
keeping us keeping keeping us informed

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,720
and yeah yeah which we have to keep that

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,000
in mind

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,160
so yeah we

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,119
should quickly at least look at some of

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,920
the items

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,880
we said we would revisit during the last

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,680
birth

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,160
so i moved the stuff a bit so that we

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,760
would

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:25,119
start talking by the you know

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,760
stuff that is actually hot right now

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,400
uh so the removal of unmaintained and

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,160
maintained

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,680
quasi native package so

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,960
well too bad entry could not make it

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,240
because in sugary was proposing a lot of

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,240
those stuff but maybe

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,079
gregory could fill up for at least some

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,000
of those or someone else yeah sure

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,920
so last year we discussed about these

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,880
three packages where we are

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,680
the factor upstream but which are not

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,599
maintained because no one cares for them

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,760
two of them are already removed from the

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,839
archive the slip past have been changed

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,160
look current and license reconcile

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,440
then we still have package components

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,440
where there are some

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:15,359
remaining reverse dependencies but i'm

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,680
quite optimistic that we can get

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,720
rid of it i think there's nothing to

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,880
discuss

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,240
about those old three this lib m

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,040
pearl came up again because uh entry

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,400
noted that

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,320
it's not maintained upstream and axel

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,720
said that he cares about it

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,480
so i think that's not the same category

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,240
as we have discussed last year what i

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,839
cared about last year was that

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,359
we have packages where no one in the

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,240
team

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,400
uh cares about it and as long as axel

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,440
cares about this amp pearl

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,800
i think it's fine to

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,839
go on as he has been going on

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,839
in the past

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,800
yeah yeah i i

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,599
i agree with what you say i also agree

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,440
with

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,520
some of vintay's concerns about that

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,720
particular package

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,359
and i think it would be good if we could

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,359
axel or someone else could try and

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,960
revive the conversation with upstream

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,800
i had i had a brief attempt a few years

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,960
ago and there seemed to be some

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,400
willingness to kind of do new releases

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,920
but

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,680
i it's not happened so far so i think

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,599
i think even even if there's acts of

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,280
interest in debbie and in helping to

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,599
maintain it i think as a principle we

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,680
should

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,520
try and avoid being de facto upstream

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,119
for these things

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,960
um yeah sure

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,000
um i i i will probably most likely reply

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,680
to axel

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,359
along those lines by email because i

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,200
don't think he's in the call

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,280
right no i don't think so okay

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,800
so yeah well we have something like one

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,760
minute left uh so

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,520
that's not much time for the rest uh we

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
have normally tooling for inactive group

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,560
member

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:11,839
no check policy digit salsa ci

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:16,480
and aircube do we want policy for that

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,040
so i think we don't have time for any of

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,320
those

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,960
but another thing we added recently was

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,760
uh

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,599
proposing some kind of pkg pair a team

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,280
social event on gt at later point this

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,000
week

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,359
anyone would want to join that if it

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,880
happens

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,920
yeah again well

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,920
let's try to organize it

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,839
sounds good great and i think we have

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,040
like

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,599
10 seconds left to well

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,960
say well not organize this because it

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,680
will be short

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,240
but well i would like to thank everyone

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,440
who

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,839
participated and or just watched or

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,839
joked on rc

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:12,880
