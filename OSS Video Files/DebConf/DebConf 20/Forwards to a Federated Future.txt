Federated social networks are a user-centered alternative to the
centralized, data-collection based ones everybody knows.

From their beginnings as a place to talk about federated social networks,
they have now grown into a rich environment 

And thanks to the efforts of the DebianSocial team, Debian contributors can
find a home on the Fediverse to share what they're doing in the project and
to showcase their work, collaborate with others and share knowledge.

This talk will start with a presentation about the federated social
networks, what they look like today and why they are important and relevant
to the Debian community, and will continue with a presentation of the work
of the DebianSocial team.

hello and thank you

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,440
i am elena or valala as most people know

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,080
me on irc

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,599
and i'm here to talk about the federated

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
social networks

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,480
the freedom-friendly alternative to

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,480
centralized social networks

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,199
i believe a lot of people here care

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,079
quite a bit about the software

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,280
inside debian it tends to be quite a

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,160
thing

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,920
and i guess that the number of people

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,360
here also cares about

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,200
the freedom in general in

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,480
computing so not necessarily what

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,719
uh runs on the the non-free software

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,079
that runs on your computer

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,640
but nowadays the non-free software

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,239
that runs on other people's computer

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,239
that we have to interact with

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,080
there are a lot of those and there are a

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
lot of issues told

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,840
by those that

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,439
caused by that lack of freedom and today

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,119
i want to talk about

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,840
one of them social networks

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,680
they are quite unusual things humans are

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,960
participants and

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,079
having access to a platformer

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,040
that allows the communication

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,240
and also remote communication

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
[Music]

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,079
which is accessible to most people on

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,680
the world

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,000
is quite a good thing if you also in

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
touch the definition quite a bit and

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,439
involve email

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,159
in the concept of of a social network

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,720
you can also say that uh projects like

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,159
debian itself only exists

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,280
because of social networks

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
the problem is that they're also a great

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,479
way to attract people

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,599
in on one platform and

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,399
try to squeeze every bit of sellable

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,400
data

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,920
about them uh and try to

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,959
prevent them from leaving the platform

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,640
in order to squeeze even more

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,920
this uh well

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,879
in some cases it's just just about uh

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,760
letting people choose between two brands

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,000
of

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,840
equivalent uh pasta or any other

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,440
user useful product and it wouldn't be a

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,640
big deal but

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,200
this this collection of data

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,720
has already been used in quite a lot of

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,280
cases

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,280
to manipulate elections to

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,360
try to manipulate society and

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,879
also it has been leaked and

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,239
in many cases it has been made available

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
available to criminals

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,879
or to other hostile

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,000
entities such as non-democratic

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,360
governments

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,959
or other things and

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,400
on on this topic of

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,000
social net network as a business model

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,720
one could talk for a long time but i

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,040
recommend

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,720
reading the article by corey doctor

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,239
zach empire of oily rags which is

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,080
better said than i could say here

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:52,720
and basically uh he claims that um

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:56,239
the the business model of social network

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,360
is basically one where

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,159
somebody collects the oil rats things

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
that

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:08,000
have very little value on their own

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,319
but can have value in a huge quantities

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
but they're also dangerous to collect in

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,560
a huge

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,000
quantities oil eggs will catch fire

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,959
and the business model of social

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,600
networks

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,639
is to let the society

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
support the cost of the danger and a

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,040
private

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,080
company get the rewards

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,199
the private company sells data

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,120
or oily rags and gets the money

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,919
and then when the drugs catch fire

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
well it's somebody else's problem

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,240
society can

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:54,160
can pay for for the firefighting

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:58,000
effort and

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,720
when people complain that this is

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,360
not the correct way to run a business

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
uh the answer is that it wouldn't have

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,400
otherwise be profitable which

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
is true because uh the profit from the

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,520
single bit of data

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,840
is tiny so one needs to be able

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:25,759
to collect data and have no expense

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:29,680
to keep it safe in order to run profit

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,360
one can then say that

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,880
maybe it's not a good way to have a

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,880
profit

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,400
anyway uh one solu a lot of solution to

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,000
this problem

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:47,440
should be political and

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,560
legal but i think it's also important to

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,240
run a technical solution

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,880
to try in parallel because uh if

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
one solution is to get away with the

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,360
social network

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,680
that's not a really a good solution

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,720
on the other hand uh free software has

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,240
been offering us

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,880
a technical solution for quite

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,880
a long time

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,240
there have been a federated and

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,919
self-hostable

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,960
server software for since

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:30,400
2008 at least one of the first

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,240
was identi identica of course

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,880
if one does not count email as a

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,600
federation as a social network but

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,840
that's

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,840
not usually considered as one

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,160
anyway with this kind of

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,520
software you could have the

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,639
social advantages or of

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,280
federate of social networks

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
you could talk with people around the

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,199
world

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
interact with them share cat pictures

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
with them

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,759
and everything else

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,199
without the problems involved there in

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,400
the

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,199
centralized world everybody could run

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,560
their own

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,400
server and control

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,360
what data got collected and then

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,880
each server tool with every other server

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,360
around

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:36,080
on the internet and

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:39,360
one could interact with everybody else

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
another such problem was one early

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,639
project was

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,400
franika which was basically

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,240
something inspired by facebook as a

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,360
it has the it has because it's still

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,479
alive the look of and feel of facebook

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,520
while identical was more

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,680
based on michael blogging

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,720
like twitter and

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:14,160
they existed then came also

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,160
diaspora in 2010 they were

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,680
they started to work and they were a

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
great place

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
to hang around with people and talk

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
about

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,599
federated social networks or maybe a bit

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,800
about for software

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,479
basically they were used by a very small

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,760
number of people

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,839
and they were all end user

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,000
entries about uh federated social

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,399
networks

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
one big problem is that of um

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,240
having enough the

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,000
user and overcome the network effort

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,440
the network effect of other platforms

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,800
this took quite a long while

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,360
uh thankfully uh well

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,519
the decentralized social networks

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,880
actually helped

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,320
some of those decided to change their

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,360
policies and stop allowing

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,040
contents that had been allowed on them

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,040
for quite a while

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:28,080
other showed that

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,600
the emphasis on trying to let people

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,200
read more and more content

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,680
done in a way that um gave them more

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,880
visibility to contact that were

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,399
controversial

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,680
and uh made people uh

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,519
angry basically meant that

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,519
reading social network was

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,240
not so good on

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,079
an activity for one's mental health so

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
people try to look around for

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,959
alternatives

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,000
and in the meanwhile also mastodon

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,360
effort happened muscle

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,839
is uh another

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,839
platformer uh also based on

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
microblogging

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,120
it happened at just the right time and

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,079
with just the right amount of

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,040
user friendliness that it started to

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,399
collect

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,040
all those people who have been

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,200
trying to look for uh for an alternative

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,120
to other social networks

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,680
and this way it gained the

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
users and most importantly it gained the

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,920
users that

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,640
weren't those bunch of nerds

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,279
who loved the free software and

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,720
federated social networks

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,720
in the beginning it is

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,160
still currently not the place to go

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,279
to meet your high school friend

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,880
friends because they probably aren't

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,279
there but it is now it is a good place

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,480
to

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:22,959
meet new people who are interested

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,279
in most the topics one can think about

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
uh

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,880
i have been on the federated social

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,560
networks for quite a few years when it

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,920
was uh

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,440
something just for nas and i was

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,560
happy there but it was pretty limited

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,600
uh on muslim i

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,279
one day i stumbled on somebody was uh

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,160
was posting mostly but also about

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,440
soccer uh this is something that i would

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,079
never ever

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,279
expected on the older fendica for

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,800
example

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,959
because well it was

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,200
it's not really a topic that interests

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,920
the most nuts

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,040
and this is great this is this means

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,560
that

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,000
i can start telling my family maybe

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,120
uh how you want to see people on the

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
federated on

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,800
social network you want to follow me on

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
social network

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
well you can find me here and you can

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,120
also find the other

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,399
people who talked about say niti

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,120
which is something that i

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,320
follow a lot of people that talk about

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,680
or

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,480
other other topics that are not

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
necessarily

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,480
free software related and that not

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,519
everybody is

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,600
interested in also the

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,639
old social network had another

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,360
quite big issue uh i mentioned that

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,480
there was

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,480
uh identical there was frantica there

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,600
was a diaspora

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,040
and none of them took with each other

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,680
except for frannika which tried to talk

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,880
a bit a little bit with everybody but it

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,880
didn't always work

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,320
another thing happened lately

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,519
and that is that in 2018

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,040
uh the worldwide web consortium

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,560
released the activity pub standard

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,440
i was born

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
out of other

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,880
protocols but and

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:45,519
it is not perfect but it works

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:49,839
and it is one standard that

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,839
everybody can collect around

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,639
it means that nowadays

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,760
while while in the past you had every

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,279
project

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,920
with their own standard talking with

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,639
just astrology project

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:11,920
in uh especially in summer 2018

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:16,160
there was a great quite a big boom of

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,279
new projects based around activity pod

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,560
also because new project

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:26,250
could interpret in the operate with

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,440
other project from the start so

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,399
[Music]

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,839
everybody could use the number of users

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,880
of master room

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,480
in order to get

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,440
access to users even if they were a tiny

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,800
experimental project they were trying to

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,079
do something new

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,320
with uh with social networks and they

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,279
wouldn't have been able to attack the

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,120
users

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,600
alone in other ways uh

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
at that time it was called the summer of

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,199
activity pub

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,320
and it saw the board of mostly

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:10,000
the platform for specific use cases

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,000
like pixel pad for pictures youtube for

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,480
videos

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:20,639
um other smaller platforms that

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,639
are still uh very

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,600
quite widespread for blogging

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,880
uh there is enough effort to make um a

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,720
platformer for

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,160
uh meetings to to coordinate meetings

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,519
which is still not uh not really but

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,240
it's been worth worked upon

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,240
and this way

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,000
things started to grow the the federated

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,199
social network wasn't just

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,079
a micro blogging platform used by a few

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,720
people

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,360
it's it's starting to be something quite

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,040
big

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,040
and useful

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,160
uh it needs to

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,880
it has a there is a danger

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,839
this danger is that the most

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,120
easy way to get into the federated

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,079
social network

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,040
is to join one of the big instances

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,030
mostly they are

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
mastered on instances and

00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,440
[Music]

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,399
that is a problem because that means

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,959
that the people who controls those

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,800
can start to control the network in

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,199
order for um

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
the federated social network to work it

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,519
is important

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,120
that people

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:51,759
can start running small servers for

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,160
just a few people uh of course

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,480
it's not reasonable reasonable to think

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,839
that everybody will sell foster

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,600
on their own server but the one

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:07,600
good way to to work

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,199
is to have small small servers

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,280
runs run by a community for for that

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,720
community especially small local

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,079
communities

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,959
for example i'm on the server run by

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,120
my local user group we have some maybe

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,400
some 20 users

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,880
we know each other we can talk with the

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
month

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,840
with the server maintainers

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,960
and we can help each other maintain it

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,240
uh this way

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,720
we can um well

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,559
we know that the people who maintain the

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,400
server can be trusted

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:51,520
uh we talked with them often

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:56,240
they their that was their friend

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:59,360
uh and uh it's also small enough that uh

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,039
it's not easy to take control

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,400
over it there are many small servers

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,280
with maybe 20 or even 100

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,360
users per server somebody who wants to

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,640
control the network and needs to

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,520
buy thousands uh

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
tens of thousands of servers and are not

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,640
going to

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,559
to be able if everybody is

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,960
on one libya muslim server

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:34,000
and the person running it runs into

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,200
money problems they could be both

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,240
and everybody could

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,919
move to another server but if it's

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,160
another big server it's not going to fix

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,480
the problem

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,039
to help people running more servers

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,840
it would be great if the software for

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,120
those

00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,640
servers was indeed because

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,679
running a server that with software that

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,559
is in debian is much easier on the

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,520
sysadmins

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,520
user usually

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,600
but all those pro projects are also

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,240
web applications basically and that

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,880
means that

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,880
packaging those is hard

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,520
there are requests for packages from few

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,720
projects one is an

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,960
intensive package but it has been

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,720
stopped workers on it has been stopped

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,480
for a while

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,440
there are pages of

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,160
javascript libraries that need packaging

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,240
yeah before

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,679
before the the project can be packaged

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,440
and they are quite a long page

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:57,360
so if more people would like to help

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
then that would be great

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,559
there is a wiki page and

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,440
an an ifc channel for people who are

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,559
interested

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,080
in this job and none of them

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,600
have seen much work in the enemy while

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,159
because

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,159
it's not an easy thing to package

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,520
and not an easy thing to maintain

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,919
but from the sysadmin point of view it

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,559
would

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,480
it would be quite great uh

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,159
thankfully there is another thing that

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,679
fabian has been doing

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,840
about it and that has

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:45,200
been running a number of those services

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,400
on instances under the

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,720
debian dot social domain for

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,520
debian contributors and for this i would

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,600
let rona talk because she's actually

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,720
part of the team doing so while

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,559
i'm not so

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:08,799
thank you all now and i'll be here

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:13,120
afterwards for questions thank you

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,679
so we have some questions i guess

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,840
uh rhonda would uh would you like to

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,200
address

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,720
um yes

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,520

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,480
continue with with my part and speaking

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,760
about what the

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,120
deviant social team does um

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,440
we can sort of integrate it or

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,720
maybe ask some questions through that

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,000
and and have a

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,799
combined q a afterwards

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,280
okay okay right uh so you can start with

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,640

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,000
thank you valhalla for for your part uh

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,520
for the debian federer's team

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,919
so to say these are two separate

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,120
efforts that started from a different

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,320
perspective

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,760
the feliverse team

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,280
sort of started to create the packaging

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,240
effort

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,200
and we as the deviant social team

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,480
started

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,159
to create services already

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,840
um to to offer it and

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,080
it was quite interesting the timing that

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,960
we

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,559
chose we did not plan uh for the

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,280
pandemic but

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,360
to some degree it's it it's it's quite

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,559
useful to have the services

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,159
up and running already um

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:45,520
my personal background um is

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:49,200
i sort of dabbled stumbled

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,640
into uh the vetivers

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:57,600
of one or about

00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:01,039
two years ago and sort of

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,559
really got hooked up with what

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,480
this activity pop protocol offers

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,480
and how this works and and and connects

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,520
different platforms with different

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,799
software

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,120
and you can interact between all of them

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,720
with just an account on one single

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,320
instance on a

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,400
server which offers

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,440
possibilities to to interact

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,039
most commonly known for the fatty verse

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,440
is mastodon which is a

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:40,880
micro blocking platform but

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:46,080
i personally chose to go with

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,080
pleroma instead which is

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,919
also a micro blocking platform so to say

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,279
it's a bit different than mustard on but

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,480
if you're familiar

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:02,080
with the mastodon interface it

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,039
also offers the the

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,679
well-known mastodon interface to use it

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,200
there

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,240
and and interact uh in the way

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,600
um all the

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,279
uh people that are used to masterton

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,919
works there's certain bits that are

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,960
different

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,960
from pleuroma to to to mastodon

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,240
one of the most obvious

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:36,159
or visible is that the pleroma interface

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,679
allows you to send longer text messages

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,200
but i think we sort of limited it down

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,600
to the 500 that

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,760
mastered on offers too so there's that

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,279
um

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,720
but let's step back one

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,039
uh let's go back one step

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,799
when you go to debian social you're

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,919
presented with this page

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,960
and you are just having

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,159
a link to to the wiki page

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,880
on the wiki page you

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,279
find a short interchan introduction

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,120
about what the deviant social team

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:20,559
is and what the deviant social team does

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,100
it consists of jonathan

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,640
kyle and myself

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,400
[Music]

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:32,480
as admins we are hanging out on the irc

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,840
channel deviant social and

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,360
we are putting most of the stuff

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,240
in into our salsa project

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,039
we are trying to to put more things

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,960
there

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:50,080
but if you want to create uh to have

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,360
an account on the different social

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,039
platforms that

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,159
that we offer um just follow

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:01,760
the link to the to create

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:05,120
an a ticket an insult

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,840
for our team use the template that is

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,400
available there

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:15,200
and we will create a an account for you

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,919
there we go through salsa accounts for

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,279
that so

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,840
that we can map the salsa username to

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:26,080
the usernames and the different services

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,200
um so i firstly

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:33,200
mentioned pleroma um which

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:37,039
is uh yeah mostly the thing that is

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,640
is used quite intensely and

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,720
and the the the way into the vetivers

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,080
that most people know

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,520
which is kind of similar from

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,880
from the way people use it to

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,360
the property platform

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,360
twitter

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,640
then we have an instance of pixelfet

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:08,080
which is for image sharing

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:12,960
people may consider it kinda

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,400
similar to um to instagram

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,520
like you can upload

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:24,159
pictures there but you can also follow

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:27,120
others um from your pixelfed instance

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,600
and that's that's one of the big plus

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,640
which

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,399
which i find very very interesting in

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,600
the whole fativar thing

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:39,840
that you have an account on one platform

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,000
and can follow people on other platforms

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,039
even if it if they're using different

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,520
software

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,919
so it really creates this network of

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,159
different islands which are sort of

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,919
connected to each other

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,880
with their specific topic

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,840
within the local timeline that they're

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,600
using

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,640
um so

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,840
there's that um the next

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,399
is peertube um if you haven't seen it

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,200
yet

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:19,039
uh it's sort of a video sharing platform

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,240
and jonathan

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:25,600
uploaded all the videos from past

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,440
debcons which is

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:33,039
really really awesome to to be able to

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,640
to see all the former depcon

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:40,080
videos uh in a single place

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,159
so you have all the past past videos

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,279
from from

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,080
the previous step comes they're in

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,679
brazil

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:53,279
but also

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:57,440
um if i reload it maybe there are

00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:00,799
already some some new videos uploaded

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,840
yeah you see some new shout outs

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,960
which people are adding to the

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,120
depcon floopy loop which is played

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,600
between the talks

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,399
so watch out there will be changes

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,320
coming out

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:19,360
up for that um

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,679
we also have white freely which is

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,120
a sort of a blogging platform

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:31,840
there's also plume which is also some

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:35,440
some regular weblog platform

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,640
which work quite um yeah

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,600
they're in quite early stage i'm really

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,039
trying

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,159
out to to dig around what services

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,279
are there available

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:53,520
connected to activity pub and

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:57,120
how to interact with with them

00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,039
but we also have services we are not

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,840
which are not based on activity pub

00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,960
primarily

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,559
but which also makes sense to have

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:13,840
under the deviant social umbrella

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:17,279
so we are offering a wordpress blog

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,080
and matrix is something that is really

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,799
newly installed which is quite quite

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,840
recent

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,840
but a lot of people already are hanging

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,159
out in there

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:34,840
so we sort of have an

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:38,320
uh metric service available to

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,360
diving contributors

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,720
obviously we also have

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,000
a chitsy instance

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,360
which helped that

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,360
the work with that um hopefully helped

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,760
the depthconf team with their ttc setup

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,600
so

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,320
there was was quite some exchange

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,320
between that

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,760
and all of it is sort of

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,480
uh considered to be in a beta testing

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,480
state

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,279
so if you just want to

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,840
figure out what what all this very verse

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,840
is about

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,840
join china's try it out find

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:31,360
people you can follow people on other

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,720
instances on mastodon on the bigger

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,600
mastodon once

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,440
you can just read the local timeline and

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,440
follow that

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,960
there's a lot of lot of different

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,880
possibilities to join in here

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,320
um we're still in kind of an

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,279
early stage but it's it's it's kind of

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,840
stable

00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,159
um we are trying to to follow with the

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,880
updates

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,840
so that the communication between the

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,880
different

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,039
uh software

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,080
that is part of the fetiverse because

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,840
not all

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,799
software is part of the fetiverse for

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,000
wordpress for instance

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:22,559
there is a plugin

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,600
that might uh make it possible to share

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:29,279
wordpress blog posts and and have the

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,840
comments for a blog post

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,640
done through the fetiverse this is

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,760
usually

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,399
the the thing that fetiverse hooks in

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,159
into

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:43,200
other stuffs like they have plugins for

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,840
for the comment sections on websites and

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,519
that's

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:52,240
also to some degree part of

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,240
being a way to to

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,840
play into the fetiverse

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,200
i think that

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,320
was quite quickly mostly a quick run

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,600
through what we currently have

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,279
most of the stuff was already covered

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:19,200
by valhalla thankfully um

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,679
so i just had to add to to that part and

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,159
and was able to build on on what she

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,559
already presented and

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,480
so we have now room for some some

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,039
questions

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,080
okay uh so uh can the director show the

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,120
ether pad yeah that's cool

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,000
uh so some of the questions are already

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,080
answers

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,960
answered on the ether pad so i'll

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,519
quickly scroll through and

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,039
see which of them need to be answered

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,799
yet

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:58,720
so these are being answered

00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,240
and uh uh there's one question like you

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,279
can answer this one

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,519
uh what can we learn if anything from

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,360
social media that hasn't been displayed

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,079
by facebook etc

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,639
such as well established bulletin boards

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,399
and blogs

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:20,159
um i think um

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,520
for platforms like

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,560
facebook or twitter or the likes

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,119
you have one central server and

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,399
you have to come up with rules that sort

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,240
of

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:37,520
fit and accommodate to to everyone

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,119
and people are still struggling a lot

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,480
with that

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,639
which which is a really pain for

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,440
marginalized people and

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,560
people with a lot of privilege don't

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,639
understand

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,720
often why something is considered

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,280
hurtful to others

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,880
and with with such big networks

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,640
they often also strive for

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,320
they have to finance their stuff somehow

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,359
and and uh they want to try to

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,599
to regain revenue and

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:20,880
a lot of these come in through

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,440
people with a lot of privilege and

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,560
on the other hand also a lot of money so

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,599
it

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,320
it it's usually very hard for for

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,119
centralized servers to accommodate to

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,640
the needs

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,680
of marginalized groups within the

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,720
fetiverse

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,920
it's fairly easy to set up your own

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,440
instance i'm

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,119
following a really really great instance

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,560
from from a black community

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:56,240
and the

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,359
they are not willing to take a lot of

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,280


00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:04,960
from from racists and

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,400
calling it out quite well and

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,320
they have when they run their own server

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,599
they have the possibility

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,640
to block out all the bigots and and

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,680
racists

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,640
and and just say okay

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:26,160
you are hosting write out hateful people

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,720
either you deal with them um and and uh

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,359
tell them that that behavior is not okay

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,720
or

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:36,960
your server is not going to seeing

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:40,320
any information from our end anymore

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,960
it's always a two-edged sword of course

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,839
because

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,640
on on one hand you can say it creates

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,240
this sort of

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,839
echo chambers on the other hand

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:56,160
it creates a huge amount of diversity

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,160
and that's the aspect that i

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:03,359
find very very fascinating

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:08,720
that there is a lot of

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:12,079
servers out there who really are

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,200
supportive and and helpful to uh

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,320
towards marginalized groups

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:23,119
and and helping and supporting them

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:26,560
and there are some servers which are

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,680
really really um

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,200
putting hateful content under the

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,200
so-called free speech

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,040
agenda and and saying they

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,000
they are just standing for free speech

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,280
and people

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
uh have every right to say their hate

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,599
for

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,800
content but the reality is

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,040
not everyone has the need to read all

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,480
this helpful content

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,680
so it's it's it's

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,079
a useful thing to to be able to block

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,280
out

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,560
people that are working against your

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,320
community's

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,440
standards and through that

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:16,000
it it's really really becoming a

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,680
really great space on on many levels

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,800
on the other hand for for the for for

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,240
especially the black community and if

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,920
you followed the news in

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,920
in recent months um

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,920
the black lives matters movement and the

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,839
need

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,359
um to talk about uh racial

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,400
bias and and all the things hateful

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,280
things that is coming from

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,839
from white people to be able to to

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,839
mention them

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,880
is something we might also

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,560
continue in the diversity buff which is

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,440
coming afterwards

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,839
so i don't want to take too much away

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,839
from that

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,520
the fativars is able to learn from from

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,720
the big platforms

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,079
that it's possible to have a

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,240
diverse community and running it on

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,280
different servers

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,040
really really helps to to create

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,920
smaller local communities and

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,880
still having the possibility to interact

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,280
with

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,640
with other communities through the

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
activity pub standard

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,760
okay uh so we'll take one last question

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,760
so let's see

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,839
oh

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,160
so all these have been answered so this

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,440
one is

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,640
uh yeah uh it's

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,800
related to academia so the question says

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,040
one place that is federated solution

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,320
have taken off is in academia

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,800
with authentication protocols like saml

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,160
how do you might they fit into the

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,680
federals

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,560
so that's the question um can you

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,760
copy the question into the chat for me

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,040
to

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:21,280
yeah i i'll do that i'll do that

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:24,720
oh do you want to answer that maybe

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,920
i don't know about this protocol

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,520
so i don't know

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,079
so i have pasted the question in the

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:39,520
chat

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:42,000
you can see from

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,000
i'm

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,960
uh i don't know about the authentication

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,240
protocol

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,880
like summer um didn't dig

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,000
too much into that part of the technical

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,520
stuff

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,240
i'm i'm just personally i'm very

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,520
interested

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,720
in in the in the thing it creates for

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,560
for social movement but i

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,839
also see that we create

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,000
also through the different software that

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,960
is part of the very verse

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,119
a diversity within the software that is

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,480
communicating with each other

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,520
and through that certain developments

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,880
and different ideas are

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,079
still very much pushing forward

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,520
and and creating a momentum on top

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:40,640
of all these feathers because

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,240
it's to some degree it's still

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,839
even though it's it's been around since

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,400
a few years it's still something that

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,040
feels new and shiny and and attracts a

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,280
lot of

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:58,800
people with with a technical interest

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,000
and through that um obviously

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,280
it has a strong background

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,720
in academia because

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,960
there is a lot to learn on on how the

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,359
social interaction works in there

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,319
but also on the technical level how the

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,440
activity pop

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,920
protocol evolves because it's it's not

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,839
just

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,400
fixated it the different instances are

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,560
all

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,760
the developers bases from from playoma

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,440
and from from mastodon and are

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,960
interacting with each other

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,520
and trying to find new ways how to use

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,280
this activity pop and and

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:45,280
based on it and and expand on it and

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,720
um authentication protocols obviously

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,680
are also parts that uh a part

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,240
that that comes into mind because when

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,000
you put something out into the federals

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,200
you're still

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,319
it's still your own yes you still have

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,440
the

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:07,040
ownership or the authorship of

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,839
of it and uh have to

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,560
to work on that so all that the

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:17,760
interlinked authentication or or

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,040
um ownership and

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,079
and through that uh through

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,800
through sharing is also an

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,680
aspect that that sounds quite

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,280
interesting

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,000
to pursue yeah

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,280
yeah so i'm i'm really looking forward

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,640
to

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,040
what's coming on what's what's coming up

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,079
for

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,880
for other people in the future on that

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,520
so i'm also excited about uh debbie and

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,119
they've been social in the freddie verse
