In this session, we will first focus **Equality** in Free Software communities, I am inviting community members from Debian and other projects to join me discussing 1) What do organizations do to ensure equal opportunity for members 2) How decision process is made in the Free Software world. 3) Can lessons learned from Free Software help to improve social equality? 

**Audience**
Anyone who cares about equal opportunity in society 

**What will we get out of it** 
Transparent ideas and actions will be documented and shared in a blog article. Potentially formation of working group to work on this topic moving forward.
