https://debconf20.debconf.org/talks/57-can-free-software-improve-social-equality/

In this session, we will first focus **Equality** in Free Software communities, I am inviting community members from Debian and other projects to join me discussing 1) What do organizations do to ensure equal opportunity for members 2) How decision process is made in the Free Software world. 3) Can lessons learned from Free Software help to improve social equality? 

**Audience**
Anyone who cares about equal opportunity in society 

**What will we get out of it** 
Transparent ideas and actions will be documented and shared in a blog article. Potentially formation of working group to work on this topic moving forward.

from the event in 2018 a little bit

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,439
about myself

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,080
um i started to engage in the open

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
source

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,519
free open mentor software community

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,360
about

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,320
13 years ago and now i see myself as an

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,760
advocate

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,520
for forced movement um

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,680
i started a first asia organization in

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,719
and i currently serve as the on the ball

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,559

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,800
yeah uh with dbn i actually have like

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,840
very personal connection with the dbm

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,199
project

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,280
because of a few dbn developers

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,120
have become my very very close friend

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,960
during the past few years

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,760
some of them are on the call today you

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,760
know who you are

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
and so um so this is going to be a vof

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,200
um

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
discussion so not a presentation so i

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,080
don't have any slide

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,560
i want to talk today about um social

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,320
equality quality and

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,640
free software i heard some

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,240
background i need to see if i can

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,240
maybe also switch off your mic

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,840
okay yeah yes

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,439
yeah so um i have rooted all the

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,399
participants here in this call when you

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,240
want to speak uh please turn on your

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,799
microphone yeah so the topic today

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
is about social equality so when we talk

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
about

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,640
equality uh i could imagine

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,439
a world of society where people

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,200
have the same status in all the possible

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,920
respects in life

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
including civil rights freedom of speech

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
equal

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
access to education to um

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
to health care to opportunities and why

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
is it

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
important that we talk about this topic

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,879
today

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
given what's happening around the world

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,879
coffee 19

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,959
like it's sadly not everyone around the

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,440
world have access to health care

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,280
and you know the very simple term social

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,640
differences but is it possible for

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,040
people elsewhere

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
i grew up in an extended family where

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
different generations share the same

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
home

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,440
so if not everyone in the world can have

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
this privilege that you can have your

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,560
driving space and share

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,599
raspberries pay to to encounter to this

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
matter

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,840
uh the good thing is uh free software

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,879
has become

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,720
a very popular phenomenon this day in

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,800
in the world companies are talking about

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,239
it governments are talking about it

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
so they also give funding and grants for

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,760
different open source projects

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
but who are the people who can actually

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,319
step into these resources you know

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
some people work very hard for the free

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,080
software community

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,560
still don't earn enough to survive why

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
company making profits and big money

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
so what i kind of contribution they make

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,840
back to to the community

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,000
and another thing that i want to um to

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,599
discuss which is the movement around

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,840
diversity and inclusive like being

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,080
an asian woman i of course very

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,360
appreciate this movement that gives

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,519
us like people um from

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
emerging countries have the voice to

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,599
speak up

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,280
but again i see many examples uh

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,120
examples where people really use this as

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,400
a weapon to get their own

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,519
to gain their own advantage and i want

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
like us to be aware

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,480
if all this matters um the power of the

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,200
internet is greater people and more

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,840
people get access to the internet

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
but also it's had the power to destroy a

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,439
person or the entire

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
organization within a few hours if you

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,720
only listen

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,479
to what's going on in the public but

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,040
don't die deep into

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,120
the whole background of the situation so

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
in the discussion today

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,560
uh of course there's so many problems

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,199
around the world that we want to

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
uh that need a solution but specifically

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
to this discussion

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,720
i want to talk about uh equality

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,120
in the free software um community

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,440
like in the recent development in the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,320
first asia community we also hear people

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,919
you know often

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,160
people unhappy because of certain access

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,600
that they get and they contribute and of

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,600
course we also see

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
like many people many long-term

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
contributors not only in our

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
organization but

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,639
around the world leaving the community

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,240
because they don't feel that they got a

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,440
fair treatment

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,479
yeah so uh so in this discussion

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,080
i want us to i invite many people from

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,320
from different parts of the world

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,000
they're gonna uh introduce themselves

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,160
quickly so we can

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
frustrate awareness and see if we can

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,560
work together

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,720
to find not exactly a solution but

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,479
um to uh to uh to establish conversation

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
and to work together in our own

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,000
organization and um

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,120
and see if we can um brainstorming as a

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,199
staff

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:38,479
of new ideas to tackle this matter

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:41,360
yeah so um i would like to um give our

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,160
participants here's a chance to

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,479
to speak a little bit about themselves

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,680
what does equality mean to them

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,199
and why do they care about this topic

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,080
um yeah so um maybe

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
norbert and you have your camera on you

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
can stack

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
uh introduce yourself where you are and

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
why do you think that

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
you care about this topic okay i'm not

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,560
brining

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
i'm i don't look like this but i'm

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,400
living in japan

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,440
um working in a completely japanese

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,360
company

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,479
this is my daughter who doesn't want to

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
go to sleep

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,520
um i'm since

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,039
some years i'm working also in the first

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
asia community i'm

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,360
highly active in the japanese

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,919
development community

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,639
and yeah so to put the equality from

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,280
this is from my point i mean i'm i'm out

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,919
of my

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
common surroundings right as a white

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,120
caucasian

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
uh you're definitely the minority where

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
i live uh

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
there's zero other from my country in

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
the

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
next three prefectures in the whole area

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
here it's the only one me

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,759
and so you're definitely out and in a

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,039
minority

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,160
and for me equality like i have been in

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,880
academia for

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
like 20 years and in industry for quite

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,360
a lot of years now

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,919
and software so far equality for me is

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,039
not

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,560
um giving people

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,560
giving people the same

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,759
chances to prove themselves but also

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,319
to expect the same so put it the other

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,560
way around for myself i mean living here

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,440
for me equality i want to be treated the

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,039
same way

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,800
i want to be in all respects like fear

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,400
treatment within the company within the

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
society we said everything

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,080
but i also expect from myself that i

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
contribute in the same way as

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
others that meant like when i was at

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,440
university i was teaching in japanese

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
contributing in a normal way like every

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
other

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,879
uh university professor uh and in the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,479
same now in the company it's really

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,520
japanese i mean everything has to be

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,560
done like this

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
so and i expect this in in all so not in

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
my only surroundings my work

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,960
surroundings but also in the software

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,080
development it should

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,199
nobody should be giving an extra

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,840
advantage because of the background this

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,639
might be

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,919
important for small kids where you

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,919
cannot be sure about

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,759
the educational background but what i

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,720
want if if you start about software

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
development

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,919
people have the right to get the same

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,479
treatment

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
the same equal expectation of what can

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,319
be done with them

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,960
but also they have to provide the the

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,599
same

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:29,759
equal level of quality

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,000
support background check

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,959
quality at the end so my this is my

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,719
expectation

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,240
and my my my what i ask for myself in

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
the surroundings and what i would like

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,959
to see in

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
software development with respect to

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,959
equality thanks

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:55,839
thank you no bird um niharika

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:55,839
would you like to start to go next

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
uh you need to unmoose yourself

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:09,120
okay uh okay are you able to hear me

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,519

hong she invited me and i am

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,880
niharika from india currently

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,200
i am a student who has not yet graduated

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
due to

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,760
should should actually be graduated who

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,399
has not yet graduated so i'm sitting at

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,200
home

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,839
currently speaking about the open source

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,480
and

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,800
how i see social valid as a perspective

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
is that i come from a women's

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,959
engineering institute

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,959
engineering college which is exclusively

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,800
in my place in india

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,880
and i first introduced myself to open

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,360
source in the year 2018

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
and that to how it started i would like

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,560
to tell you

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,760
it was uh during my engineering first

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,920
year that i

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,440
joined engineering because i was a

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,160
hardware freak

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
i wanted to play with circuits and for

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,040
me

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,519
hardware with fun hardware and firmware

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,959
all these things when i joined

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,000
engineering and i took

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,200
electronics and electrical i

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,760
just took it uh because to do a lot in

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,760
that

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,800
there were a lot of people in my

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,160
friend's circle

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,680
my roulette use already a lot of

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,640
people who kept back women

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,320
not work in the field of hardware women

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,040
choose software you don't have

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
any scope in the field of hardware and

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
it's very difficult

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,200
for them when it comes to the settlement

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,360
in life or after life that they see

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
after education it is not at all

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
possible you have taken the wrong

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
decision

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,680
this was something that i kept hearing

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,200
for almost

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,670
two years of my engineering and

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,770
completely untolerable then when i join

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,770
[Music]

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
this institute started helping me in

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,720
developing myself

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,279
as a woman and also through this journey

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,000
i got myself introduced to open source

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,079
hardware open source software actually

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,680
free open source came into my life

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,920
and i started contributing to fossia too

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,880
and that is how my journey of open

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,680
source started

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,399
and i saw that field of open source

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,600
hardware

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,680
has very very very uh greatest

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,720
opportunities out there in the country

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,560
and later on i this is how i started

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,920
telling the people who told me that

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,519
women cannot work in hardware and has

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,560
no scope has actually

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,200
seen you currently contributing to arm

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,240
and contributing to trusted firmware and

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
this has

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,079
happened through the open source so this

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,680
is how my

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:10,560
story and my journey through opens

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,600
started yeah thank you niharika so i

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,360
think that we share

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,519
a little bit of a similar experience

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,120
i i also do believe that i got a lot of

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,839
opportunities after i joined the

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,040
community

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,120
especially access to education and

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
amazing people in the community so let's

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,600
move on

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,320
um let me see who would like to start

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,920
next

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
roland why don't you where do you go

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,399
hi i'm robin turner i've been

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,880
oh is my microphone noisy which is

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,880
complaining

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,279
so i've been involved weapon source for

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,639
a long time i believe i first used

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,800
36 psd in linux back in about 92

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,800
and have been involved in

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
licensing and and reasoning about

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,920
licensing

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,399
since the late 90s certainly for example

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,760
the

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,120
idea of the mozilla public license

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,200
permitting dual licensing under the

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,079
canoe licenses was something i proposed

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,800
as far back as 98 i'm part of the

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,160
organizing team for the foss asia annual

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
open technology summit which happens

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,680
here in singapore each march

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,920
at least so far i hope we get to next

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
year

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
and my work is a chief privacy officer

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,079
for

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,440
an analytics company and

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,519
that touches on this discussion in two

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
ways one some of the use of our

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,600
technology

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,040
is to strengthen inclusivity in

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,959
corporate settings

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,720
that is to help hr teams improve the

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,320
involvement engagement of minorities

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
rather than simply their

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
sort of token appearance in the

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
organization

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,880
and the other is as a chief privacy

00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
officer i'm directly involved in

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,880
applying

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,360
human rights concerns to

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:11,440
the use of software and processing in a

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,600
in a commercial setting this has

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
some bearing on open source which i'll

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,480
be speaking about in a few weeks

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,000
at state of the source but i yes

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,079
and very short notice for today's

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,199
session so i have prepared nothing more

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,279
concrete than that

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,279
so i'll head back to home book

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,639
thank you roland and so roland now are

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,199
based in singapore right so let's move

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,639
to

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,760
a nearby region

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:44,720
i have missouri on the call

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:47,839
hey sorry where are you oh

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,120
hi working

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,320
yes okay hi everyone

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,079
i'm from thailand i have been

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,360
a part of open source communities

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,399
uh probably uh at least probably since

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,920
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,399
or so uh advocating for uh for the use

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,920
of it

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,360
and installing linux and some samba

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,959
send mail in a clandestine manner

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
in in enterprises

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,440
and developed various products and

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,519
solutions in in in the open source

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,760
technology

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,560
using open source technologies uh

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,000
recently

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,920
uh being completely inspired by by

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,639
spending two decades in the open source

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,120
movement i have decided to uh to adopt

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,639
the open source way of education

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,240
by homeschooling my children as well as

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,279
establish coderdojo thailand

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,959
also a a learning environment very much

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,240
based on open source i also organize

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,240
open tech summit thailand

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:04,560
with with hong kong mario and the um

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,639
and the first asia team and i

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,480
am i am an inner source coach so to

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,759
speak so i adopt

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,440
best practices from the uh from the open

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,199
source world and i

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,519
applied that to corporate development

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,800
teams

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,079
i i in regards to equality in open

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,360
source i i see it as

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,120
somewhat uh a double-edged sword um

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,399
so to speak or two sides of the coin

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,519
right um so me

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,959
myself uh i i owe my entire career

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,120
um my my entire existence to uh to to

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,639
open source where would i be without

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,920
great tools like uh like linux

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,560
perl python and and and whatnot i mean i

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,959
can't

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,759
you know imagine if i had to for example

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,959
pay for

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,160
for software uh licenses for

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:59,440
for for these tools or being unable to

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,440
uh to modify them to suit suit my needs

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
it would have been a complete disaster

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,640
so

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:10,000
i am very much er um

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,160
also um being basically from from

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,559
thailand we don't have a very large open

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
source

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,640
community here so to speak

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,120
but but the global community has allowed

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,799
me to

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,720
access uh great resources uh

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,880
um great uh uh great people

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,320
um allow me to have discussion

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,600
conversations and learn

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,600
from uh from the best talent that

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,840
probably the world has to offer

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,559
right and for that i consider myself

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,679
extremely lucky and extremely privileged

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,720
and but yet at the same time we still

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,880
have issues

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,600
for example cultural perhaps

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
many thai people for example don't speak

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,960
english

00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:00,559
and english is the main language of

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,960
the open source which uh

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,080
which makes it uh at the present very

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
very difficult for

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,160
um for people uh giving thailand to

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
access the um

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
the uh the the open source community

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,600
there also issue other issues such as uh

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,160
shyness and and inability to uh to share

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
um there there are many people i mean i

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,919
for example

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,880
uh grew up being extremely introverted

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,320
right and it took me

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,760
a long time to um

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,360
to get myself in the position where i

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,720
can do things like this where i can talk

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,200
to you

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
reasonably comfortably but i noticed

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,799
that for many developers

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,799
participating in the community is not

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
um

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,280
it's not a comfortable experience

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,919
especially not face to face i suppose

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
that's why

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,200
many people in open source prefer emails

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,400
and chat right

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,880
um the um

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,559
so that so that is one aspect of of

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,200
equality um but then

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,760
uh i think on the other hand if we talk

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,679
about

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,960
standard things like gender equality i

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,000
don't think that there is an

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,840
issue there uh basically because any

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,919
gender can join in the open source

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,840
movement and you can

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,440
you have generally the option of staying

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
anonymous right if you stick to emails

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,280
and chat

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,400
then you don't need to reveal uh your

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,200
your gender or you can express it um

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,120
any way you want and i think that for

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,320
the most part uh thailand doesn't

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,120
uh have uh that problem however it can

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,160
be seen that

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,160
the um that the community here is

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:42,480
uh quite i should say over represented

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,679
uh by uh uh by males

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,000
um the other issue i suppose is access

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,120
to

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,600
uh to resources because um participating

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,520
in the

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:57,360
open source community um if you are

00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,559
if if you are not paid to do open source

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,120
um requires free time requires

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,960
equipment requires connectivity which

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,480
not everybody has

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:13,360
but that sort of um so contrast that

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,679
with me who has always had

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,360
computers always had access to the

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,880
internet

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,880
those have enabled me the opportunity to

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,360
um to participate in open source

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
projects up my skills and gain the

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,559
benefits from that but for many people

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,520
they don't have computers they don't

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,520
have connectivity

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:39,200
it it uh it it makes it really really

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,880
difficult for them um

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,640
yeah yeah thank you very much i i

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,559
understand what i hear from you is for

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,120
you equality is mean

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,600
access to education asset to tooling but

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,320
you also emphasize a few of uh

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,240
challenges uh that we can ensure

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
equality so that the challenges based

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,360
and problem we're going to discuss in

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,600
the next point of discussion

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,280
yeah thank you very much for for giving

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,000
us a heads up

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,480
so i see here in the core i have a few

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,080
people

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,159
coming from hong kong so the now that

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,080
hong kong's really

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,600
in the news what happening they're

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,120
always ready to honestly

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,360
curiosity of the people would you guys

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,039
want to um share a little bit about

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,640
what's going on there

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,679
who would like to to start from the hong

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,840
kong site yeah whole office

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,840
hollow uh

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,840
i represent a group of specific hackers

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,919
and social activists

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,960
in hong kong we call our collective

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,039
station

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,760
actually the formation of station was

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,400
inspired by the debian's maintenance

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,400
team

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,159
um structure that how do we equip people

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,200
uh with uh with decentralized

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,559
ways that's been something we've been

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,080
exploring now we have around 200

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:10,080
people in the group and

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,679
the decentralization of the movement has

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,000
been a major

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,320
discussion or even controversy within

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,520
the activism in hong kong for several

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,760
years

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:25,600
until the 2019 nt

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,000
ntel ap movement which is known as the

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,120
water

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,960
movement um then we have

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,159
uh more solutions or more uh

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,400
more familiarity to the idea of

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,200
open sourcing and and also crowd

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,320
sourcing

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,360
um initiatives in the movement so

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,679
i guess my time because this this is not

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,240
a really a presentation session so i

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,919
won't

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,960
go into dive into all the details rather

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,679
i would actually uh copy and paste

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,480
uh some of the notes that i prepared

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,640
into

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:08,000
the notepad that um

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,159
yeah so you should be able to see

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,159
my notes from the notepads now

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,120
and i think there are several

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:24,159
things happening within the two

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,159
years first of all is of course the

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,320
water movement that put hong kong in the

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,679
spotlight of the international community

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,880
we are cool again because uh

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,240
open source has been you know

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,880
um facing some obstacles in the past two

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,120
decades

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,720
our seniors have fight really hard to

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,000
promote the idea

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,360
but um for general public they don't

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,559
ring a bell because

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,799
um they usually they're really

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,400
familiar with closed source and

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,360
enterprise products

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,159
and many of them are also more

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,279
comfortable

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,320
with engaging to a fender customer

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,799
relationship with uh

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,960
with every aspect of their lives we are

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,240
enslaved by this

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,760
uh consumerism in it

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,320
in every aspect of the society but

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,400
with the rise of social movement and

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,440
democratic movement more and more people

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,720
realize

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,960
that you can not rely on a

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,440
already made product because there's no

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,520
already made democracy right you can't

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,200
buy it from a supermarket you have to

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,039
build it from the ground so

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,840
this diy spirit arising from

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,559
social movement is also what made me

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,000
engaged

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,039
so in contrast with many of you who has

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,679
been

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,480
engineer or your your background might

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
be or

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,600
yours the society that you were in

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,720
already

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,000
generally more open for me

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,720
i have been a problem solver i

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,919
faced a lot of problems in social

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,799
movements

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,960
be it security be it really hard to

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,000
collaborate with other people

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,760
it's hard to build trust and often it's

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,039
really easy to

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,000
be fragmentized by the government or

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,480
by the establishment that we have to

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,640
stop

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,880
being creative that we need to

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
build ways that we can work together

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,640
better

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,360
so once i heard that there is such thing

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,679
that is called open source and open

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,799
and crowd sourcing i realized wow this

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,320
is the direction

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:41,600
that i and we together need to explore

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,520
so i actually go home down i iit guys

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,799
like one learn

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,600
to well i actually go to the cafes where

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,559
i t people gather and ask do you know

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
what open source

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,000
can you teach me can you introduce me

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,200
and i want to be

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,919
a part of you that's how i learned more

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
and more

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
and of course later i realized open

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,520
source is

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:08,720
not a magic portion that solves all your

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,640
problems uh and in fact it also faced

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,320
some of this problem in itself for

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,000
example you have to

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,120
be explaining to the muggles a lot

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,600
and but that's how

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,240
like i think in the past five years i

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
have been

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,840
on this way of engaging with the

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,520
i.t community and the social activist

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,600
community that i have been

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,640
with and in terms of

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,320
concrete topics i guess you will be more

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,039
um interested in how open source and

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,480
free

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,360
software play a role in the

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,400
movement actually i wrote a article for

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,000
civic hall

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,320
i will send out later of listing all the

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,520
technologies but i would emphasize on

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
the uh

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,799
the use of teleconferencing and live

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,440
stream

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,799
which created a sense of togetherness

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,720
and participation

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,720
in the past we can only participate

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
through joining an organization

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
but now we are seeing more and more

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,679
point-to-point collaborations

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,679
and people by just looking at the live

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,919
stream they feel that as if they are the

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,720
one who were beaten by the patron of

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,720
police

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,000
and they are there even though they're

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,440
trapped in their office

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,120
and that really increases and mobilizes

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,799
social movement not just in hong kong

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,640
but worldwide and

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,600
another thing i would emphasize is

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,799
the use of telegram it is widely used in

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,000
hong kong

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,120
with several historical

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,679
points where because we don't have

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,200
a universal suffrage first of all and we

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,000
also don't have um

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,039
referendum so in our law we cannot have

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,440
a general fault

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,480
so we have to also actually be breaking

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,159
the law to

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,279
have votes and in 2014

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,399
there was a pseudo or de facto uh

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,880
referendum

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,880
that requires telegram that's why there

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,919
are many people who installed

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,159
telegram uh even if they're housewives

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,640
or you know middle-aged uncles you don't

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,799
use

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,640
computer at all and that is one major

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,640
point getting the general people

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,760
to to install that app first and that

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,520
later yes i want to to put in here so

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,039
you are absolutely great and i want to

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,360
say thank you very much for all the

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,279
notes that you place into the interpret

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,200
you also touched on some of the

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,720
solutions that we would like to hear how

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,159
to keep people connected

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,200
online and engage newcomers very good

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,960
thank you very much

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,799
i would like to go back to that point a

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,720
little bit later

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,960
i want to hear now from um raphael

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
raphael actually based in sunjeon next

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,360
to next to hong kong

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,960
and let's hear another perspective from

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,080
somebody who actually lives

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,120
in china rafael are you there hi

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,360
hello i'm rafael i'm rafael lee i'm

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,200
i'm a member from the local community

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,240
called shenzhen diy we are maker

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,679
community

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,279
we make software's hardwares and a lot

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,600
of interesting things we even have a

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,600
band

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,919
back into the universe the years in the

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,320
university

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:27,360
i was interested in electronics i built

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,760
a lot of circuits using

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,799
with the instruments that we have in the

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,000
laboratory

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:37,919
but we i felt the happiness

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,039
of making things after that i chose my

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,480
career as an electronics engineer i

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:49,200
design instruments for

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,200
measuring different kinds of

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,120
parameters for batteries

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:59,840
and et cetera and at that time i started

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,520
uh work as an embedded software engineer

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,559
since i need to program

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:09,279
a program that mcu's to

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:12,640
make to make a fully functional product

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,600
and the back into that period i use a

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,000
lot of

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,960
silver which are not open source and not

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,840
free

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,320
i we use some versions of crack

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,159
softwares

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,279
we to be frank we do not have any choice

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,399
we use the crack software when we are

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,679
in university so

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:39,440
then we we will choose the software

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,440
that we are familiar with so we

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,600
so we do not have any other choices so

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,640
um and then there are some

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,279
very very luckily i met the

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
members of shenzhen diy zero i started

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,320
to use

00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,080
linux at my linux uh used derby as my

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,000
linux distribution

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,279
and after several years i

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,320
i abandoned the windows and my daily

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,240
computer i use

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:15,120
linux always so

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,159
i think the free software really made a

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,240
very great job

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,080
and i want to uh i am already involved

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,320
in the

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,000
free and open source open source

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,279
software movement i'm

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,480
already a developer i make patches for

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,960
free software projects and you know

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,919
i'm a user and i'm telling my friends

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,840
the free software and open software

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,600
they are very important they are

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:47,360
changing our lives

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:50,880
so that's a bit of my experience

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,880
i think for the

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:58,640
i think the younger generations are more

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,840
involved in free software naturally

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,840
the a from for example the front-end and

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,960
background developers the

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,039
the well-run program their

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,320
software to run on linux distributions

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,519
not windows

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,279
the windows server are much much lesser

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,840
than nx servers

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,799
so naturally they need to use the

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,559
compiler

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,159
need to use the free front-end framework

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,480
and

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,559
back-end softwares back-end servers

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,960
they are naturally free and open

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,919
software so the younger generations

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,519
have the better opportunity to involved

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,640
in the free and software

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,360
open software movement

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,320
i think the internet the id industry are

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,399
more involved

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,120
than any other traditional industries

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,080
for the traditional industry for example

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,159
electronics

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,840
and ic design are

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,080
controlled by the big companies the

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,240
softwares and

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,159
softwares are made by a small group of

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,640
people and companies

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,039
they they need to be charged for a lot

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,399
of fees to use that software and

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,760
for recently something happened in

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,039
to the sino-american trade war

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,760
and that makes a lot of harm to both

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,519
countries

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,159
um i think using with using free and

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,919
open software will solve that problem

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,320
and now

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,320
mainline china proposed the

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,519
proposed project called i

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,960
our own operating systems

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:45,679
which i think that will be in

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,240
huawei will be a lot involved in that

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,399
project

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,840
all the resources are going into huawei

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,000
in mainland china anyway

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,039
um maybe the uh

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,840
they are some open source uh software

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,919
projects

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,919
from them but not much and

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,519
the okay that's a bit

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,519
from my side

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,280
thank you rafael it's super interesting

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,599
uh to hear from you

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,560
uh we will continue in a little bit

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,639
later

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,679
um i see eden eden would you like to uh

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,440
say a few words hi

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,520
hello so

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,000
i i would like to make it briefly

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,720
because we don't have much time left

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,800
so i'm from vietnam and i've been

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,240
contributing to post asia for like 10

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,040
years now

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,079
and because i'm in vietnam so i would

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,320
like to follow up

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,599
the discussion that mishari just

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,639
mentioned

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,560
uh there are actually two issues about

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,399
social equality that i'm really

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,040
concerned about

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,000
the first is the current issue of

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,040
convict 19 related to convict 19

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,920
so like in february when the

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,440
gangnam started to you know spread all

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,920
over the place

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:13,119
vietnam decided to to apply socialist

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,760
distancing for two months so around this

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,960
time

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,680
all the school was shot

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,440
[Music]

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,440
or switched to online learning

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,640
but with online learning the problem is

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,000
many students in the mountainous area or

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,920
in the small ethnic group

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,040
they don't have access to internet or

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,800
they don't have a machine

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,359
like pc or smartphone to in order to

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,240
to do online learning so during that

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,800
time

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,440
well most of the students is the big

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,440
city

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,359
were able to resume their normal

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,560
learning online

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,400
the students in like in the mountain

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,040
they were not able to continue their

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,359
study so they fell behind

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,800
and i want to see like in this

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,280
discussion i'm not sure if we have time

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,119
for this but i want to hear from

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,880
from the speaker and other people how we

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,760
can handle how we can

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,560
tackle this issue this is the first

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,480
thing

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,800
and the second is somehow related to

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,440
somehow similar to legislation in

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,800
hong kong and china like a little bit

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,720
political

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,240
like 10 years ago no matter

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,440
what status that we have in the society

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,200
no matter how rich or poor we are

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,119
we would be excluded from any political

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,520
decision making

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,440
because you know just vietnam only one

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
party you know they make all these

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,960
decisions themselves

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,119
but like my like recently

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,400
when you know when technology changed

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,839
the world so

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,040
uh chance to open data and

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,880
you know social media and free software

00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:02,400
we were able to register president put

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,400
more pressure on the government

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,480
our voice like they don't i mean

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,240
i was i must listen completely that

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,359
sometimes we were able to

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:18,079
raise our voice in little extent

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,520
uh but still i know it's going to be a

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,720
long journey

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,280
until we can reach the freedom of

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,720
speech freedom of racing hours like

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,760
taiwan or any other asian country

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,320
uh so i wanna see like how you do it i

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,880
wanna

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,400
like you know let me close it to vietnam

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,400
is thailand

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
and i want to hear from you guys and how

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,839
we can you know

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,079
change the situation in in certain

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,880
countries like in vietnam and we can

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,119
do something like all the technology

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,119
open

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,240
thank you eden so i just want to make a

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,079
quick connection here when we talk about

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,760
southeast asia right the situation in

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,800
vietnam in thailand we also have

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,760
somebody here

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,400
from singapore who who before work for

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,839
uh

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,320
some somewhat the government of

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,680
singapore like it's famous for

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,960
a very established uh country

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,800
where people get opportunities um

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,720
everywhere so kiwi i want to hear from

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,560
you is it really the case in singapore

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,320
that people get equal opportunity and

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:29,680
access to education everywhere

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,680
all right hi my name

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,079
nice uh is guy

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,160
a long time we've seen each other okay

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,520
um

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,920
um by one saying uh yeah singapore could

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
be

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,119
the kind of position itself have a

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,839
reputation of where is this quality

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,880
uh what not high standard living but in

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,920
reality

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,359
uh i don't think that is 100 true uh

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,480
just a bit of background

00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,520
um i've been uh as a civil servant for

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,800
20 years for close 20 years and decided

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,960
to quit

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,280
and start my own business um so the

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,320
entire

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,320
genesis behind it is that i felt that in

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,400
my 20 years of civil service

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,880
experience i do not think um equality

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,040
and civil service is compatible so to

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,400
speak

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,079
different people may have different

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,680
point of view but i will just position

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,800
myself as a much more

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,400
critical uh individual that

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,280
see equality

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,880
uh and what not to be something a bit i

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,480
put on more critical answer

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,320
per se to realize that the

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,720
kind of system and structure that is put

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,079
in place uh i don't think that's

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,760
only unique with singapore i'm quite

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,720
sure this happens everywhere in the

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
world

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,880
uh to how to really uh bring

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,839
uh what we try to discuss here equality

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,839
equal opportunity

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,720
to your fellow

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,880
you know people in the country um so as

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,440
a result

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,000
i quit my job we started this company

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,880
called

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,640
lions forge uh i would say that is more

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,000
like a social experiment

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,040
um the whole idea of that experiment uh

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,280
is about uh how someone uh without any

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,640
form of technical knowledge

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,640
or business experience can kind of

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,720
make use of the tools that's around at a

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,319
time back i would say that back in

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,839
2017 and then start a business

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,880
that can compete against um the

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,920
mainstream corporation uh so in this

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,599
case for lions forge

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,280
what we're trying to build is a digital

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,839
fabrication system which include laser

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,160
cutter

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,359
and its future uh maybe even metal 3d

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,680
printer

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,800
that can be equipped to every single

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,920
household

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,119
the the the question here

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,960
is i mean the rationale

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,160
is that in so doing we allows

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,599
people from home or anybody without any

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,800
much experience can

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,359
produce uh goods from their household

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
uh and we are not talking about simple

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,040
craft or one of we

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,560
intend to build like to the point you

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,359
can build engine parts

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
from your home and i'm not talking about

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,560
people with

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
uh with a garage i'll talk about folks

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,839
like

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,520
in singapore when you can build

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,560
components

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,839
from your public houses a public

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,960
apartment

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,839
which is very small but easier said than

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,440
done

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,839
the question here is that my vision

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,839
of equality is go beyond just software

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,200
uh i'm trying to take it upon

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,560
the entire hardware if i can the entire

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,839
industrial ecosystem

00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,720
uh that's uh kind of in a way

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,079
um to bring the cottage industrial back

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,800
uh to the mainstream

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,640
uh by empowering the household with

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,200
tools that can build really

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,800
high-end and high-tech products from

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,119
their house

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,040
and obviously all these who have been

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,200
powered

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,640
through open source system and it should

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,760
not be controlled by

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,880
the state or any corporation

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,440
uh so that was the the the kind of end

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,680
game

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:33,280
uh that lions force is trying to do so

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,880
the uh this concept uh was around uh

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,800
i can't i came i developed this concept

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,920
probably three years before i left my

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,200
job uh

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,480
probably back in 2015 uh that around

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,400
time uh so that

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,760
is where i kind of uh chance upon for

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,079
the open source uh then kind of i

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,119
decided to take upon myself um to kind

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,800
of learn

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,720
uh in that time but kind of a bit of

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,040
hardware a bit of coding

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,760
and whatnot but not a whole lot uh so i

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,760
have no

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,520
i'm not an engineer at all uh and then

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,599
see where i can move from there

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,440
and then bit by bit i try to engage the

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,520
community and that is how

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,480
i chance upon the meeting with force

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,760
asia

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,800
and then to realize that we all share

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,200
the same ideology and values and that's

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,520
why we became a good friend and then i

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,680
started to get myself involved

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,839
with force asia

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,079
yep so i question the uh in this uh

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,839
discussion uh i'm not really a coder

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,680
or developer so i'll just say that it's

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,520
a kind of like uh

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,960
uh just a guy where barely two years of

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,000
experience or two three years experience

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,319
with the open source

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,079
but i'm doing my best i see why i can

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,240
milk out of it

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,240
to kind of make sure this social

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,440
experiment works

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,359
so far so good thank you kiwi

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,880
so i'm looking at the time here we

00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,000
actually running out of time

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,599
um shortly i've been taking note of what

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,160
people are saying so i just want to

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,240
repeat a few questions that

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,440
i noted from the discussion so i have

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,079
something related to

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
social cultural differences language

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,240
barrier

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,800
access to the right resources

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,680
and the government political settings

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,560
support like big companies

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,119
rejection from from government and

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:31,040
limited access to education from

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,040
like students and kids from remote areas

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,680
and yes so this is some of the

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,880
and not so easy to onboard people like

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,400
into uh free software or start to uh to

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,200
engage with different projects always

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,400
require a lot of effort and explanations

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,760
um yeah and then i also note that a few

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,000
potential

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,240
ideas for the solution for instance

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,079
raphael pointed out that like back and

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,640
infrastructure are getting cheaper and

00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,440
cheaper

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,319
it's also a motivation for people to to

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,119
code

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,920
in the overall space of resolution and

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,160
keep we

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,240
emphasize a point that we should empower

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,440
people to peel their own products to

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,520
build their own things

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,200
i know that we did not give everyone a

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,560
chance to talk but i'm looking now at

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,520
andreas and mario

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,640
as we now discuss about uh production

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,480
and how to mp

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,480
empower people to do something i know

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,400
that mario working on hardware projects

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,680
do you have anything to add in terms of

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,400
solution space

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,480
and the same for andreas so we heard a

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,520
couple of problems if you

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,280
want to say something quickly in um or

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,480
and call for action

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,960
yeah so we have about two weeks okay so

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,160
my call for action is like we meet need

00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,640
more of these

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,079
meetings that we have here i i see like

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,920
even though i didn't say

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,359
anything the entire meeting everyone is

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,520
just pointing out

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,760
the same problems from their own uh

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,760
perspective right we see in hong kong

00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,680
you guys are doing like more and more

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,640
peer-to-peer technologies i would call

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,319
it right

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,640
and that's what we're working on here at

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,359
force asia with uh suzy ai with look

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,160
like

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,000
um search engines and so on and i'm

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,079
seeing that we need more production and

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,839
this production could be potentially

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,200
local production i know that this is a

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,119
big topic

00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,880
of tv where everyone can just do

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,000
something and we need to do it

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,839
independently of the large corporations

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,960
there's nothing wrong with earning money

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,680
and doing business

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,079
but we see that like companies that we

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,400
know

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,680
right that google for example supported

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,160
us for many years

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,160
and we're grateful for that but like in

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,839
regards to what they earn and what they

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,040
get from society

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,880
it's just very very little and it's too

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,680
little to solve the problems of the

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,800
world

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,839
so thank you very much and for all this

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,400
inspiration and

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,480
and um i hope we can follow up on this

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,760
and collaborate more together

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,920
and so that's my take on that

00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,040
andreas do you want to say something i

00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,880
don't think i have

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,720
one sentence to save the world but i

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,920
think we should stick together and

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,440
work together and my my point in in this

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,720
step conf is that i think

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,119
corona is really hard for everybody but

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,319
we have a lot of chances and if we all

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,960
would probably not have

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,760
met that way and i hope we will continue

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,960
in this way

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,119
somehow that's all okay

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,240
thank you very much anyone else would

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,920
like to say

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,240
find a word you're out of time

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,680
okay so we are out of time officially

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,440
thank you very much

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,760
everyone and um

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,520
see you next time so we will document

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,599
the note on on the internet and share

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,599
with

00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,520
