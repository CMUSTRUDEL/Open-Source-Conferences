Welcome to DebConf20! Feel at home, grab a drink and snacks, and feel welcome to join us in the largest auditorium we have ever had in the world.
We sincerely hope you are not jetlagged and that the facilities are conveniently located. We will make our best effort for you to feel home. Along with all the usual chores, doing the dishes, taking care of the kids, and so on.
This session will... Well, basically serve the social purpose of saying "hello and welcome", and kickstarting our exciting week of online activities. We know that it's not the DebConf we usually have every year, but we are striving to provide the closest possible experience to it!

mercedes 20 online

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,399
2020 has been a crazy year just turned

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,079
all our lives upside down

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
but that also means we crave a return to

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,199
normality and long to spend time with

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
our debbie and friends

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,560
sharing ideas solving technical and

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,000
social problems

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
and maybe playing some mile in the

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
evening every year

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
we try to bring demcon for a different

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,240
part of the world to connect to a new

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,520
local community

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,680
and share the responsibility for

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,040
organizing it with a new team

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,920
this year we were planning to host

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,759
devconf20 in haifa israel

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
but we've had to postpone that to next

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,600
year or maybe even 2022

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,759
we'll see how things look early in the

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,560
year instead we're going to have to hold

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,720
this online

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
which is going to be different we're

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,479
mostly attending from home

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
spread across time zones but that also

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,200
gives us an opportunity to bring new

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,280
parts of our communities

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880

respectful as we expect it to be

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,560
if you are harassed and requests to stop

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,560
are not successful

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,599

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,959

find contact information for incident

response in the depconf20 website

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
how is remote.conf going to work not

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,440
that differently from an in-person

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,319
debconf

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,280

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,840
social events

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,840
and a hallway track social spaces for

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,599
people to have unscheduled conversations

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
technical or not

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,280
as always everything is streamed on the

internet and recordings will be

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,680
available later

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,120
many of the talks are pre-recorded but

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,439
there will be live q and a

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,360

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,480
will be given live

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,560
group discussions will be done through

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,239
dignity video conferences and streamed

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,879
over the internet

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,760
notes will be shared via etherpad

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,840
real-time communication will be on ilc

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,519
discussions also happen on mailing lists

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
but more slowly

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720
jitsi is also there for casual

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,199
conversations and discussions that

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,440
aren't on the schedule

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,440
this schedule is available at the

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,240
devconf20 website

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,040
and is available in your local time zone

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
as well sprints are moments of

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,080
concentrated effort

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
organized by teams to work in their

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,720
respective areas of debian

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,120
and some of them are planned to in-depth

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,440
conf in parallel with the talks

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,880
for general interaction with other dev

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,160
conf attendees use our irc channel

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,000
debconf on oftc

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,560
we also have the hash bc20

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,520
hyphen talks channel for discussion

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,479
related

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,199
to the talks as they are happening we

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,039
recommend

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,000
you to use a proper irc client

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,560
but you can also use the oftc web chat

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,680
client

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,639
which is linked from the streaming page

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,960
each talk has a shared notes document

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
for

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
questions and collaborative note taking

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
the link for each talk

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,039
is available in the streaming page when

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,880
the talk is happening

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,039
and also on the top page

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,639
buffs are our discussion sessions if you

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,600
want to be an active participant in the

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,280
discussion

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,919
you need to have the jitsi call link

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,800
talk to the session organizer to get it

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,240
to join gtc from a bio device you need

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,560
to install the gt mobile app

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
it's also possible to dial into gtc over

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
the phone system

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
if you have a poor internet connection

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,919
but that may be an expensive

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,479
international poll

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,199
if you would like to just watch the post

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
sessions

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,000
follow the regular conference streaming

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
gtc doesn't work very well with hundreds

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,400
of people in the call

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,160
under 20 is much more reasonable

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
we've had a little bit of practice with

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,240
this approach to online conferences

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,560
at the recent we need a cough online but

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,880
we're definitely still learning

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,880
and relying on lots of brand new systems

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,199
that have lots of bugs

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,720
so please be patient if we run into

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
trouble

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
on that note we would like to thank all

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,160
of the volunteers

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,600
who have helped to make depth of 20

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,199
online possible

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,520
it's been a bit of a scramble in the

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,680
last few months to get this together

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
and i am proud of what we have got done

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
but this is not over yet

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,560
during the conference you will need

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,800
volunteers to help with several tasks

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,800
you can sign up for tasks on the

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
devconstruanty website

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,919
you don't need to have experience in

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,880
these tasks

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,160
the video team can train you to help out

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,840
but

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
you will need a decent internet

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,639
connection

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
thanks for watching and enjoy dabconf20

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,160
thanks for watching and enjoy that kind

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,039
