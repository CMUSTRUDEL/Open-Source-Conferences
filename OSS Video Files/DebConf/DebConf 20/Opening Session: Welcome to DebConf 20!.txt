Welcome to DebConf20! Feel at home, grab a drink and snacks, and feel welcome to join us in the largest auditorium we have ever had in the world.
We sincerely hope you are not jetlagged and that the facilities are conveniently located. We will make our best effort for you to feel home. Along with all the usual chores, doing the dishes, taking care of the kids, and so on.
This session will... Well, basically serve the social purpose of saying "hello and welcome", and kickstarting our exciting week of online activities. We know that it's not the DebConf we usually have every year, but we are striving to provide the closest possible experience to it!
