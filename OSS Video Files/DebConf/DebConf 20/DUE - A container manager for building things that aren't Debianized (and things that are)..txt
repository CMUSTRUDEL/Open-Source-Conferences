Dedicated User Environment (DUE) is an open source tool for creating and supporting different Debian based build environments.
Written in Bash, it is both a collection of wrapper scripts that allow for the configuration of build environments in Docker containers, and a launcher application that makes managing and working inside those containers as user friendly as possible. In addition, DUE supports  configurations that can make building most software for any Debian based operating system as easy as building a package.

Its user base can range from novice developers who want to try building something without changing their host machine configuration, to build systems engineers deploying it on shared user systems and integrating it with build automation.

In this talk I'll discuss the number of problems that DUE solves, why it used internally at Cumulus Networks/Nvidia to support our Jessie and Buster based releases of Cumulus Linux, and how it became the recommended build environment for the ONIE open source project.
