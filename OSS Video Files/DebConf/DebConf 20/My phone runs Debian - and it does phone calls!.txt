There were devices like the N900 and the Ubuntu phone running Debian based distributions before but now we have phones without proprietary software components (maybe except firmware) and mainline kernel support is emerging. Needed software is already in Debian or on it's way in.

This talk gives an overview about the Phosh/GNOME based software stack. Where we are heading, what is still left to do to make it every day usable for hackers but also people that just want control over their devices back.
