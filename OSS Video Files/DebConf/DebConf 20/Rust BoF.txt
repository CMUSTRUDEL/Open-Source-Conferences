This BoF is a chance for anyone interested in rust on Debian and packaging rust software to talk about their interests and issues. In case you don't already know, Rust is an efficient new language with some very nice features for security and parallelism https://www.rust-lang.org/ As it grows in popularity more software is written in it, which means there is a demand for it in distributions.

Do you have particular rust software you would like to package?

One subject we hope to cover is the problem that the current mapping of rust crates to packages produces a lot of small binary packages that then get stuck in the NEW queue. This is unsatisfactory for everyone: FTPmasters, rust packagers and users. Getting the right people in a (virtual) room might help us work out what to do about it.
