hi

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
welcome to the damian golon packaging

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,280
team both

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,599
so like last year

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
i decided to propose above to discuss

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,960
the state of

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
the team and what needs to be done what

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,400
has been done

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,840
so let's

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,960
start so the idea is first to make like

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,320
a

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:45,840
current table i present oneself briefly

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:45,840
hold on it doesn't seem to be going

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
apologies it does seem to be going now

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,680
okay go ahead

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,719
hi so welcome to the debian golden

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,719
packaging team buff

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,920
so like last year i proposed this buff

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
so that we could discuss

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
the state of

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,000
well uh how to move forward

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,280
so my let's start by

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,159
doing some a round of presentation

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
just state uh who you are and what

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
you're doing briefly

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,799
so i'll start so i'm

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,720
i'm not a real

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,520
very active member of this team but well

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,200
some stuff needs to be done and i try to

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,479
at least help

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,840
doing them so okay

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,840
go ahead who's next

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,399
i'm happy to go next my name is reinhard

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,560
i've been in debian around for quite

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,399
some time i've done a lot of working

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
multimedia team and

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,399
random other packages i started uh

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,040
becoming active

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,719
in the debian go community mostly

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
because i'm interested in some container

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,640
laser packages i have

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,640
packaged the

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,319
container-related tools the builder

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,440
scopia and potman which aims to be

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,800
docker replacements docker is also

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,400
maintained inside of the debian golang

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,959
team

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
and there was quite a bit of work too

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,560
for actually all the reverse

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,160
dependencies that exposed me a lot of

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,760
what the go team and debian is doing

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,800
and i am attending this buff to

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,400
learn more about eu folks and

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:50,560
to see how we can

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,879
make goal in debian better

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
thanks

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,760

then

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,160
so i'm a 20 year old computer science

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,320
student and i've been a dd

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,440

continuing in 2019

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,479
in the go team i maintain a couple of uh

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,919
dependencies or i think around

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
40 45 packages um i mostly maintain

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,919
micro

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
uh it's a it's a text editor uh which is

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,840
which is some

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
something between in micro uh nano and

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
wimp

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,120
uh so i maintain its dependencies

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,880
and um i also maintain uh gitlab's

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
dependencies the golang part

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,080
and i keep sponsoring a lot of uploads

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,440
um and i also uh patched some cv

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,840
bugs for stable old stable and um

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,680
of course bullseye and sick so that's my

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,919
involvement with the goatee

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,919
thanks

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,400
do you want to say a few words about

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,600
yourself

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,520
uh yeah hi my name is nilesh uh i'm a

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,240
member of the go team

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,639
since the past few months i maintain a

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,120
few

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,680
packages in the golang team which is

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,479
mostly the free dependencies of

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
medical softwares and also from time to

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,160
time keep

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,039
fixing rc works uh for the coolant team

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
that's my involvement

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,680
okay thanks and i see we have

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,919
luca can assure on the bed but

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
is not in here apparently

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,080
uh well anyone else want to present

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,080
himself

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
otherwise we'll just move on

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,240
well i can quickly present myself i'm

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,840
michael bank i'm

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,520
mostly maintaining a fcd so it's a

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
descriptive consensus store because one

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,639
of my packages petroni

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,600
um uses the best one and there were a

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,120
couple of

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
problems i think there's still a release

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,280
critical bug fight cd

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,840
so i'm mostly interested in that and due

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,520
to that i joined the team

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
great thank you okay so i think that's

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,280
it for the

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,400
active participant

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,680
uh so okay let's start

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,960
idea was to maybe review

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,400
for some unsolved items from

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,160
last year agenda uh whatever is still

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,479
ongoing or unresolved

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,210
and that was so i linked it

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,400
in the pad but

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,919
[Music]

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,120
while discussing with reynard we decided

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,560
to try to move

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,560
up two items which is

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,160
a go mode issue

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,280
and the need to migrate away from

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,800
build using in our packages

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:23,440
so about gomod issue

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:27,120
uh my understanding of the issue is that

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,000
go might migrate away from using gopass

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,319
and we use gopass extensively

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,720
to build packages so we need to

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,080
find a workaround and the workaround

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,319
exists which is a good thing

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,440
the thing is our tooling does not yet uh

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,840
under that so yeah

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
i post it uh before anyone wants to

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,759
check it

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,240
i post a link to the message from

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,599
changing who unfortunately could not

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,639
join us but

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,280
he did some tests to

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,319
validate that it is possible to build uh

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,280
go

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
the way we do it without using gopath

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,599
but

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,960
yeah it's so far nothing more

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
has been done

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,960
from the link myself

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:29,280
so yeah the and the idea is to

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
to use a a

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,279
specific uh go build command line with

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
some

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,640
some platform i have to admit i don't

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
really get

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,519
what it implies so if anyone has more

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,080
information about that

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,839
could talk about it i mean i'm happy to

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,880
try to hack the edge coding to

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,680
handle that if needed but i mean it's

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,959
better then i

00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,320
do do a bit of work but

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,320
i would need help in understanding okay

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
what's actually going on and what needs

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,320
to be changed

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,560
i did take a look at the implementation

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,920
of the current goal and that helper um

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
what it is currently doing is a very

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,839
interesting hack

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,120
um and very creative hack so um

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,959
with go path um you

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
how it usually works is you you do go

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,880
get you uh populate your

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,240
um your working director with all the

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
dependencies and all the library that

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,160
you have in a working directory

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,480
and um do go build by setting goal paths

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,760
to do okay build what i have right here

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,120
in the debian context we don't want to

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,640
download stuff randomly from the

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
internet we want to use the package

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
version so

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,800
the the current tech what go mod is

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,120
doing is it's creating a build directory

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,880
it's creating a new um temporary

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
directory in the build sources

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
and will then sim link all the

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,399
dependencies of

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
um with placing something that are

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,760
basically placing a sibling form

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,120
to user share go

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,519
whatever the libraries are um

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,360
yeah and on top of that the actual

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,959
sources are being copied in

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,720
so what how i understood xinjiang's

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,160
email what he was proposing instead of

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,839
doing that it seems to be possible to

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,279
use a completely different approach

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,360
which to be frank i find very

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,800
attractive and very interesting so

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,959
instead of

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,720
building this temporary directory we

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,959
could instead

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
rewrite the go mod file in a way that

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,279
says well

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,320
um instead um the gomod file contains

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,760
the name

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,680
and um um the one the

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,279
text so what is the specific

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,240
distribution of the dependencies that

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,000
you want to use

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,760
it seems to be impossible to replace

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,320
them

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,360
to use a share of um user ssd

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
and and then have to go from that that

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,560
would

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,240
allow us to no longer have to copy this

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,480
temporary directory it would allow

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
to do incremental builds i find that

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
approach very attractive but to be frank

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,480
i

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,160
did not have a chance to try hacking up

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,440
the goldmine that's over to be frank i'm

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,480
not even sure if it

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,680
works um having two modes

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,720
it might be um a case where we need to

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,600
have a goal line

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,200
depth or two or something um alternative

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,120
implementations that implement

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,560
completely outstanding portfolio

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,360
so one of the main thing we need to

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
decide is that

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
do we have to do something about that

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,959
before bullseye

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,560
or can we still go by

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,279
with one more release

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:57,839
and make sure this is fixed for the

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:57,839
release afterwards

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,959
i guess the question is um right now we

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,000
are using go

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,600
lang 1.14 uh do we plan

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,200
on moving to a newer version of go

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,560
before

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
bullseye release or not

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
well my personal opinion on that is that

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,600
if we don't absolutely need it for

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,200
a very important package let's not but

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,880
unless we have uh information about okay

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,639
well this would be

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,720
duplicated and there will be no security

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,720
support in the next two years

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,440
but yeah well anyway security support of

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,959
the packages

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
is also an issue and that would be the

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,920
next item but maybe

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,839
someone else wants to discuss a bit more

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
about the gomod

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,680
i think it kind of depends on how fast

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,519
we can get this to work

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
whether it is like well before the

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,399
bullseye release or

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,240
um because i don't foresee any security

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,040
issues uh but it's just uh

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,120
the time it takes to uh to test it out

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,760
and make sure it works on all of the

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
packages so um yeah i know we are all

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,639
busy

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,760
like with fixing bugs existing like

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
other bugs in so

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
uh these things takes time uh and for

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,120
example like with the

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
new so-called new packaging workflow

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,519
with uh uh dh mexico like et cetera

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,480
these this takes time for people to

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
understand absorb and to write it like

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
change the tools for them

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,279
so i think that's that's the bottleneck

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,639
and

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,720
i guess we'll just see how fast we can

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,360
get all things ready for for the next

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,199
release

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,680
either either debian 11 or 12 yeah

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,440
i guess it would be it would be good in

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,320
this uh

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,760
i mean as you said uh those things takes

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,000
time we have a lot of packages

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:06,160
we're not sure how well this approach uh

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,880
this workaround uh zenjing is proposing

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,240
would work for all the packages so it

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,760
would be nice to have

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,839
uh to start early

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,199
on the next ready cycle to work on that

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,519
maybe

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,839
or that for me that would be a sensible

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,839
plan

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,800
if i may share my personal opinion i i

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
think

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,079
you're right we have a lot of work to do

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,120
um and

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,440
i don't think that we can um have like a

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,760
cut over date after which we will

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,519
do a mass migration of package to one

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,639
side for another i do think there needs

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
to be an extended

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,279
transitional period like we do for the

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,440
proper compatibility levels

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:59,040
i think we can start working

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,519
on this novel way of of

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,560
uh dealing with gold mods um like uh

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,000
something uh

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,480
um proposed and explore and experiment

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,040
with that

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,399
in parallel to existing packages and

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,360
existing packages

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,199
i mean i we do have quite some packages

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,720
that don't even use gilmores at all

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,399
um so we would need to keep the existing

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,680
implementation around for those packages

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,959
anyways

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,920
um with that in mind i don't think

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,399
there's um

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,160
i mean it's a prioritization call um i

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
think you propose to wait for that after

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,399
 release um

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,560
i don't think we need to wait i think

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,360
if we feel this is something important

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,199
because the next release of um

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,959
upstream golang will drop the support

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,639
for gopath we

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,480
need to have something in place as soon

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,680
as possible it would be prudent to start

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,880
working on

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,920
um this gomod

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,279
dev helper sooner than later but it's a

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
prioritization call because you also

00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
have

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
other things to do like migrate from

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,839
those using

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,480
a part further down the road so i wonder

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,320
if we

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,120
and how we can achieve both goals um

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,440
in a reasonable time frame yeah well i i

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
i

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,720
let me rephrase uh when i was saying uh

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,839
start

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,759
working on that i'm not

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,680
suggesting well it was poly phrase

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,519
because i'm not suggesting we

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,079
should not work on that at all i mean

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,120
i'm fine if anyone wants to

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:33,040
start looking at that and start to

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,959
hack some tools to work on that i mean

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,800
i'm not going to disagree with that on

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,480
the contrary it would be great

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,480
the thing is we can't make in my opinion

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
and it's only my opinion we can't make

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,120
like a priority

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,120
over other issues like

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,160
stop using build choosing and stuff like

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,079
that for the

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,240
which are a requirement for the next

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,279
release and the next release i mean the

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,800
freeze is uh

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,800
six months away less than that actually

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,880
well i think you're right uh we can

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,919
always uh start staging

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,600
stuff in experimental and then uh do

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,079
uh archive uh rebuild and see

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,720
how much how much uh work that we have

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
to do

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,400
and then maybe from there we decide if

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,600
it's a if it's a

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
if it's compatible to go uh to with

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,520
bullseye

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,799
or we should uh let bullseye get

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,120
released and then maybe

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,200
upload it to save uh so maybe yeah

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,120
starting uh this transition and staging

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,320
and uploading to experimental would

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,440
probably be the probably be a good way i

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,960
think

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,720
yeah okay

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,720
so let's move on to the next item or

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,840
anyone else want to chime on

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
this one

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,720
okay i guess we'll move on

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,440
so yeah next item is migrate away

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
from build choosing so a bit of context

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,080
here

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
we are using the build choosing control

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,760
field in our packages

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:13,520
to know which packages which

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,840
packages are used to build a specific

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
package

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,200
we started using that before it was

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
policy to not using it that way but only

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
use it

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,080
for the

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,080
legal reason that is

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,200
i mean telling okay well i did build

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
this thing

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,559
with this other thing and that's

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,240
required for uh for instance

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:45,440
uh by the apg license

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,960
so policy now prevent us to use build

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,679
using field

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,559
this way just to say okay well i we use

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,480
this in this

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:57,200
package to to

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,280
build this one but we since all our

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,880
packages are aesthetically linked

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,960
we do need a way to know which packages

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,320
are have been used in building one

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,440
specific package

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,120
the reason is if we need to update for

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,640
instance for a security update

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,000
one package we need to rebuild uh or to

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,400
build an mmu

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,960
all the dependencies so that's

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
we need some way to to know which

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,280
packages are used in the building

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,840
process

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:33,600
so my proposal would be to

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,520
create a new field which would be x go

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,960
build choosing

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,520
the idea is to mimic the way rust

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
team do things they use x cargo bill

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,840
choosing

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,280
at first when discussing this with uh

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,360
ivarde from

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,280
relisting you got the dekker the

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,760
i was thinking it would be nice to use

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,520
the same field because it's the exact

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,360
same usage

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,480
on the other hand i don't think

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,080
we need to

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,480
change the stuff for both teams i mean

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,760
that

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,960
would be adding work for the rest team

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,159
and for little to no benefit

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,280
so just create our field

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,679
check which tooling needs to change uh

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,200
needs change i mean we definitely need

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,640
to

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,880
patch a dhca rank for that which

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,240
is feelings in this uh this field

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,679
uh i am not aware of any other tool that

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,440
actively uses this a

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:47,440
part maybe dhma golang which

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,720
might request that on the ftp master api

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,159
to

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,880
check for what dependencies are

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,280
for a specific package are already in

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,280
debian

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:17,840
so yeah

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:17,840
everyone wants to

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,919
well or you think about it i'll just uh

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,760
and try to answer the questions that's

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,919
occurring in the pad

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,400
so yeah well is go ever moving away from

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,679
static linking i don't think anyone any

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,480
distribution is actually using

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,360
the dynamic linking in go i've been

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,200
talking

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,679
with people from canonical and

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,360
actually removed that from they started

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,039
an experiment in that and they removed

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,400
it because

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,840
they say it's not ready yet i mean

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,159
no one builds uh dynamic modules uh

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:08,880
it is it exists in the in the go to link

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,880
but no one is actually using that so

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,360
the idea is that uh well upstream is not

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,880
using it

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,200
and we are probably going to have a lot

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,880
of issues if we try to do that and i'm

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
not sure it's worth the effort

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
of course it would be nice to not have

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,360
static linking

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,080
but i don't see that happening in the go

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
ecosystem

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
soon

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,080
no i mean at the end leaf from debian

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,039
want to provide value by providing

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,440
applications

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,440
um from personal experience with talking

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,880
to container upstreams

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,799
they are sympathetic but

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
frankly they are more focused on well

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,520
how can they deliver value and

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,360
for from their point of view um

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,080
rendering and statically linking

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,080
everything

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,200
allows them to move at a much higher

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
velocity um

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,039
which makes problems downstream for

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,640
distributions like us so we're saying

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,080
well no we don't want to bundle we don't

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,360
want to render everything

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,600
um we want to provide a new universal

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,440
operating system where we control what

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,039
are the bits and pieces

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,159
that we provide i

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:27,520
think our effort is better spent

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,360
in focusing on the build using issues in

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,520
providing some tooling where we can

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,080
support the security team with

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,280
identifying what needs to be rebuilt and

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,679
solving the

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,559
duck issues that clemens was talking

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,760
about before

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,520
i think that would be a better

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,000
investment of our time

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,640
compared to convincing upstreams like

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,919
fcd

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
or other high-profile calling software

00:23:49,919 --> 00:24:05,840
to

00:23:50,240 --> 00:24:05,840
consider dynamically linking

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:12,720
okay thanks i agree with you

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,159
uh well and apparently no one disagrees

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
if someone disagrees

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,720
please shout

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,320
okay so yeah well that's uh we are

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,440
actually moving to the uh yeah

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,679
what is the issue for the release team

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,720
and the security team

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,360
uh with nowadays

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,919
it's the same issues that all statically

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,559
built

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,960
uh language have i mean rest has the

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,080
same issue

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,440
and any other language

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,440
which works the same way we'll have the

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,960
same issue the thing is

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:55,440
go is much more ubiquitous than

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:58,960
uh rust for instance and

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,200
when you have to update one go package

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,799
if it's a library and if it's a popular

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,480
library

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,279
well we will you will have to work on a

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,240
lot

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,240
of other packages and so

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,360
the the problem is uh i

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,960
i was uh so last year i was we were

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,159
evoking this issue already

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,200
uh meanwhile i've tried to summarize it

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,640
by talking to

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,000
people from release team

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,120
mainly evo detector but also pearl brush

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,640
and people like that so yeah it's uh

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,640
there is a dark issue that

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,240
means that not only you have to know

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,400
which

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:49,679
uh packages needs to be rebuilt for uh

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,480
to make a billion view of them but the

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,039
problem is

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,480
uh dak when you try that that will

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,120
scream at you

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
if you do that in the security database

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,360
of deck

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,640
uh because it does not have the source

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,440
retargeted for the

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,840
other packet even if you don't modify

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
this

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,520
you you still need the source to build

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,120
the others and

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,120
so this is a dark issue i mean it's a

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,279
bug it should be able to

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,960
get them from the main archive which is

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,240
complete and has all the shops

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,240
needed but so far

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,200
there is no ability for that to look for

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,320
stuff in other archives i mean and the

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,080
security archive

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,760
and the main archive needs to be spread

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,760
they need to be sprayed because

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,120
well when you have security issue you

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,200
might have um embargo

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,600
on some issues and uh

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,400
merging the archive would probably leak

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,080
information

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,240
that we can't click on an umbrella issue

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,840
and there's mighty sun and there's a lot

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,120
of other stuff that

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,840
would appear and leak the stuff that's

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,440
unborn good

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,640
so it's not an option so i've

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,720
been trying to move a bit forward

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:14,159
by what we've been talking with why not

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:18,320
to try to map this issue

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,320
while patching back the way to do it

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,440
duck is watching python and so yeah well

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,960
we need someone that

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,720
knows python and is uh

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,559
[Music]

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,159
he's ready to have a look at back i mean

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,919
i've looked at the code it's much better

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,039
than before but

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,240
i'm not a python guy

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,559
on the other hand uh that might not be

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,039
the

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,960
sole way of fixing this issue i mean

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,000
maybe if we can just provide

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,200
okay the list of all source package

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,279
and a way to okay well here is

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
all the rectangles that you will have to

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,799
upload to

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,919
to your archive to make the bin enemy

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,679
possible

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,440
maybe that would be that would be enough

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,360
for the security team

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,039
so i've sent in now recently uh

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,240
crossbusting and

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,559
well recently that's uh two hours ago uh

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,720
crossbosting and debiango the

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,559
biannualities and sexuality team

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,559
ultimate security.org

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,080
asking if there would be open to set up

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,200
an adaptation so we can

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,000
uh you know uh talk together and

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,520
decide how we could uh make things

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,600
better for everyone

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,760
because so far i've been talking a bit

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,240
with

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,240
evod from the release team but

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,919
he as he told me he can't really know

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,480
okay what would be sufficient

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,919
for a security team to be able to

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,640
maintain properly

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,640
go packages

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
so

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,120
so far that's where we are did not

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,960
receive well i did receive a reply from

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,159
walgree bastian blanc

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,600
that stopping using using this

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
would fix it but i'm not sure it would

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,600
actually

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:27,600
fix it well

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:29,919
that's where we are for now

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,840
so to be frank i i find the current

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,600
situation a little bit confusing if we

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,760
if you step a little back um the

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600
issue about supporting security support

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,640
is clearly not specific to the golan

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,880
community

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,679
we also have other language communities

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,840
that

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,760
are pretty much in the same boat most

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,600
notably are the haskell and ocam

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,440
communities which also do statically

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,320
linking and the release team has

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,440
standing trackers for those i wonder can

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,799
anyone report

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,399
why this problem is so prominent for go

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,279
and not for other ones i mean

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,840
you're right we discussed about look

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
there are

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,120
issues with the build using there are i

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,120
see on the

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,159
ether pad there's a proposal to use

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,960
built in for foss

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,840
that i see um there was a request look

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,279
we need to

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,080
be able to do uh no a sourceful

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,000
uh rebuild which i guess could be

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,679
attached to spills we need to do some

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,559
changes to duck um but i'm

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,440
kind of getting lost in in the details

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,320
what is the bigger

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,360
biggest picture and why is it so hard

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,200
for golan can

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,399
someone share some thoughts on this

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,520
please

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,320
i do have at least a partial answer to

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
this

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,440
because i asked the same question i mean

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
this is this is not

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,440
a go problem it's a back problem and

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,880
it's a problem for every statically

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,240
linked language

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,279
and but the answer was that uh

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,519
every go package uh and some of them are

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,399
quite prominent like i mean primitives

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,240
or docker there are important package

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,200
there is an app security update

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,919
stuff like that the thing is there are

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,039
lots

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,320
of good packages there are rest packages

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,279
or camera packages

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,600
there are a lot less of them and they

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,240
are

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,440
not as critical as some group packages

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,840
are

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,799
so it adds i mean the

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,080
wizard go without the sheer amount of

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,039
packages that go

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,039
it's manageable for the team so no one

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,720
said okay well it's annoying but it's

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,960
manageable the problem is

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,960
with

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,840
the problem is with go there are lots

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,200
and lots and lots of dependency i mean

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,799
everyone who has tried to package

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,559
something and go

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:51,279
as notices that's always a lot of work

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:54,640
so it's not really a girl problem it's a

00:31:51,279 --> 00:32:01,840
it's a fact that it starts to be

00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,840
too much for the security team to change

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,720
i mean i mean at the bottom line clayman

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,720
and i discussed yesterday two days ago

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,360
actually um

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,600
some of these details and i think we

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,840
both agreed that

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,200
this is a topic that needs to have the

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,840
right people involved

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,679
and this is a topic that has a lot of

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,679
angles to look at that would easily

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,080
exceed the scope of this buff

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,760
i would strongly suggest that we come up

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,600
with a follow-up gt session where we're

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,039
discussing that specifically with the

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,120
right people involved i

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,120
don't think this meeting right now is

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,600
the best use of our time to discuss the

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,320
specific details unless you

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,279
have a clear plan or have something to

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,279
present um i

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,880
yeah well i totally agree with that i

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,519
mean that's uh

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,279
the meaning of my email to my cross

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,679
busting for me

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,200
a while ago yeah it was good that you

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,480
brought it up because i didn't even know

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,480
about these issues so whether

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,000
i've heard of it about these from last

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,720
uh like from

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,320
previous release but uh these were put

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,200
in focus so it's good that you have this

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
list and

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,960
i think it would be great to even put

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,440
this up on our team websites

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,240
and uh so is there some place for us to

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,600
look at as a to-do list

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,720
for wide exposure and etc uh so it's a

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,919
i sent an email summarizing this issue

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,960
in last february and

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,760
the email has been someone took the

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,200
email to

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:56,320
create a wiki page

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:59,919
which i can probably link on the pad

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:03,600
awesome thank you and

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,320
here it is so yeah so i mean it's not a

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,080
to-do list

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,000
yet because i'm not sure exactly what

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,560
needs to be done it's just as a okay

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,679
summarizing the issue as i understand it

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:18,639
and it's uh

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:22,079
let's say a start so the idea is to

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:26,240
as we were saying we spin up to try to

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,240
talk with the right person and

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,240
so that uh i mean as always in debian i

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,760
mean working in a team is sometimes

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,359
already difficult but working across

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,200
team we know it's uh

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,200
it might be difficult so let's try to

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,599
take opportunities in the comf

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:48,560
to put the right people together and

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:52,560
actually transform this um

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,679
this issue that i will

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,679
link the wiki page here

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,920
and transform this into the list because

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,560
yeah i agree that uh it's still a bit

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,480
vague for everyone and i mean i don't

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,240
claim i have a complete understanding of

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,119
the issues i mean i don't

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,160
don't know much about how the archive

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,079
work

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,000
in a dd for less than a year and

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,839
yeah i mean i want to help but i'm not

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,960
sure what i can actually do

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,640
and i think we're quite a few

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,200
with the same issue but yeah

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,880
for sure since i've been organizing the

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,160
both last year i've gained some

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,440
exposure in debian uh to go like

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,680
people consider me oh it's a good person

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,480
and uh well why i don't consider that

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,599
tour

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,320
it means that people came to me

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,520
to ask me oh well when are you going to

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,400
do something about this

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,400
and usually people from the release team

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,160
now this could could you try to then try

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,880
to bring the right people

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,760
and schedule an ad hoc session until the

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,680
end of the week

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,359
to discuss about those things and get

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,480
some extra action

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,040
items instead of just well if you're in

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
the

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,720
if you're in the on the go debian go

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,960
mailing list

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,560
uh you probably you you can probably see

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,520
the email i sent

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,520
a couple hours ago

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,200
which was sent to the release team while

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,680
the

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,000
debian release mailing list and the team

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,040
at security.

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
so that's the idea let's uh let's try to

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,880
set up this session

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,400
and if and when

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
hopefully one uh i have uh people saying

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,280
uh

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,599
from this team saying hey yeah uh i'm

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,040
okay to

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,240
let's do that well i

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,200
i will of course report back on the list

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,000
and everywhere i think

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,040
well let's set up a agency session and

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,160
something and

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,160
well people please join i can't do that

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
alone

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,839
yeah good to see you join us at hinting

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,200
if you have any uh

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,280
feedback uh um on the this issue we

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,920
discussed or anything uh please speak up

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,200
uh uh also i think we all have only

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,320
eight minutes left

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,599
is it the case it's uh is it

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,400
do we end it yeah yeah the buff is 45

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,640
minutes but

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,079
i was expecting uh this talking about

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,040
this taking much time and

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,480
yes i suggest we move on because well we

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,480
probably

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,480
exhausted the project from now

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:57,599
so the next uh items

00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:01,359
we had last year what let's go

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,599
quickly on them so there was a

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,599
go library transition rebuild issue that

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,160
was evolved and

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,760
so yeah the issue was that there were

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,800
some new option releases

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,839
that were released and uploaded to sid

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,760
during the stream during the freeze and

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,079
the of course that

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,440
is a problem because if then if they

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,640
don't

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,680
migrate well they will

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,720
migrate if we fix another package that

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,079
depend on them

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,560
so we absolutely need to refrain doing

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,160
new observations during the freezes new

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,520
absolutely should be done only on

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,200
experimental

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,760
uh as long as the phrase is going

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,640
otherwise it's a nightmare for everyone

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,880
uh changing last three days i had to

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,520
re-upload a lot of package with uh ugly

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,560
versions

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,480
like uh something something something

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
uh dash really something something

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,640
something uh yeah let's try to not do

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,079
that again this release

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,200
and the problem is we of course we can't

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,920
prevent people to make mistakes but

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,280
we need to maybe try to communicate more

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,599
about

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,800
all this so that this mistake is not

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,000
done and i

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,119
i don't know uh if there is a way to

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,920
maybe prevent or at least not prevent

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,359
that but at least

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,760
uh make people aware that they are doing

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,079
that

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,440
uh maybe lynchian czech or autopika g

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:43,839
test check

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:43,839
if anyone has idea it would be great

00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,440
hi

00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,839
i think i heard some starving talking

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,880
but

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,119
i can't hear anymore

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,119
uh

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,200
hi um uh came here

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,480
yeah yeah yeah it's okay okay okay so

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,000
the problem of the

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,319
during the freeze time is because we uh

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,040
uh i think you do you have to talk to

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,119
the

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,960
issue about the uh using issue

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:32,560
so this is the same problem because

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,240
the risk team will

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,920
uh a package can't migrate to

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,119
testing because it has a bluetooth using

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,480
field and it needs to wait all the

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,920
packages

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,040
which the build using refers so

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,319
right if one of the

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,119
library is bumped against uh during the

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,800
free time

00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:02,240
sen and the race team is not happy to

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,680
uh uh set a allowance for it

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,079
so all the reverse dependencies will be

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,079
blocked

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,240
so this is a

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,680
major problem why we can't allow people

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,839
to

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,560
uploading any packages not intending for

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,000
the

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
testing during the freeze time

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,000
yeah i agree it's kind of the same

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,720
problem as well it's not the same

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,599
problem as

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,720
all the whole build using issue that it

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,240
has connections and

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,599
uh i mean fixing the bill choosing

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,240
his age will probably help

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,720
somehow but yes it's still uh we still

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,920
need to

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,560
avoid those unwanted potential

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,560
transitions

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,960
so maybe an experience report um while

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,440
working on

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,000
the dependencies that i had to update

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,880
for

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,839
apartment two i was using the wrath tool

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,040
the ri

00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,520
tt tool a lot and i was surprised that

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,000
some of the different

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,720
dependencies that i had to upload were

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,280
as much as

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,040
50 rebuilds that were necessary i went

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,720
through all of that and

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,280
stage them in experimental and it's

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,319
totally doable even on

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,960
a laptop but it is tedious and it's

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,599
something that i think could benefit a

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,079
lot from automation maybe that

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,640
could help people making more informed

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,520
decisions

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,200
whether um a new upstream upgrade or

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,319
whether an update of a goaling package

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,640
would be

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,240
appropriate or not appropriate um i see

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,520
there was an item on the

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,440
agenda on the bot agenda about um maybe

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,079
we can use some salsa ci

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,599
um pipelines uh to assist with these

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,319
rebuilds so that you don't have to run

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,440
rap

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,319
on your local laptop um shenzhen do you

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,040
think that would be

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,839
an effective means to help with that

00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,839
particular issue

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,000
some days ago maybe months ago some

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,680
people

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,040
proposed on the dependable male needs to

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,079
set up a right as a

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,359
service but i don't think

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,839
someone is working on it it's a

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,000
it's better than the southern ci because

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,440
it

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,960
we reviewed all the dependencies

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,560
is not um i don't think

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:40,240
uh someone say i can rebuild uh

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,560
the reverse dependencies because it

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,440
takes so long and uh

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,440
i think it's better uh another service

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,880
and

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,400
and i think so the person who proposed

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,720
the services

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,760
from the python team because they also

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,760
meet the same problem

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,400
yeah i think many many teams face the

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,480
same problem and

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,440
one another issue about salsa ci is

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,599
because

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,680
some people's workflow usually people

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,880
first upload and then get push

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,920
their chains so sometimes people do that

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,200
and

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,200
yeah i know it's

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,839
not the best thing but some people do

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,839
that anyway

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,160
well we might want to agree as a team to

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,359
not do that in our team

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,960
that would be good and yeah maybe

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:39,280
if we could use a ci to at least check

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,920
if there are issues uh i mean even if

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,060
it's only x86

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,800
that would be already something i guess

00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,119
[Laughter]

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,240
using rat as a service if it happens

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,680
someday of course

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,200
it could be great but i'm not seeing

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,079
that happening before

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,200
next release well i mean let's be

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,119
realistic

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,760
but uh yeah maybe we could maybe someone

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,280
would be open to start a discussion with

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,000
a buy something for instance

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,520
so that okay well let's try to find a

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,640
solution for that uh

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:18,480
since we have the same problem let's

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,640
try to see if we can fix for

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,160
both bison and go and maybe probably

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,640
others as well

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,280
yeah in the ruby team we have our own

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,839
tool that we have to rebuild everything

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,040
uh when we are uploading a package it's

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,280
kind of the same thing we

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,880
rebuild and run we run out of package

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,119
tests so

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,520
i think we should join efforts because

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,520
it's a

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,760
it's a problem across teams now yeah i

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,079
mean if there's already a tool for ruby

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,079
maybe it could be modified to be

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,640
to do the same for patent and go yeah

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,520
um so we're running out of time uh i

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,760
just have

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,599
i just want to quickly uh point to one

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,599
thing that i want to talk about but we

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,599
can take this to iris as well uh there's

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,599
there are two packages called golang xtx

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,480
and golang golang xtx which i think is

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,119
the same thing

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,720
i'm not sure why is there a split uh

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,839
anthony i think you packaged golden

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,240
golem x text

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,440
even though golang xtx was available in

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,480
the archive

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,280
um oh sorry i i renamed the package to

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,480
fit the

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,800
the naming convent sorry um it's

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,319
the the old one is supposed to be

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,880
removed

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,599
uh okay so we essentially want to file

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,880
an rm

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,560
right for golden x text uh i i

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,400
think so i forgot if i did that or not

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,800
sorry

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,760
um some of the very old gold packages do

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,880
not follow the

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,079
the uh the naming convention and so i

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,160
was

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,720
change i changed some of them but then

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,960
 found it to be a lot of work

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,720
and so i think it's something to discuss

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,359
whether we want to do that in the future

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,640
but i think

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,280
we move that to irc um

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,359
well we are out of time we're already

00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,079
moving

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,760
after the time so yes well yeah thank

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,680
everyone for attending

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,680
thanks a lot lina for taking notes and

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,240
yeah well let's continue discussion on

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,240
ic or mailing this and stuff like that

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,800
yeah or maybe we could have more uh uh

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,960
