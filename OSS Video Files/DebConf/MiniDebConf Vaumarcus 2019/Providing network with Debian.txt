Why we use Debian in our provider infrastructure, from virtualization to routing and web services.

	00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:14,629
and this torque is a it's not very

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:19,380
interesting but we want just to we just

00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:26,869
we are user of Debian on the we just

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:36,990
expand your project with the with Debian

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:38,810
no swamp disciplic the liquid system

00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:43,170
Debian on fat Cunha

00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:47,040
this is or Debian ecosystem in or in

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,260
French infrastructure goals is to

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,130
provide Internet access with a net

00:00:49,260 --> 00:01:00,080
neutrality so we we need to make some

00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:00,080
choice with material on the soft way

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:10,979
Navigo is easiest maintenance on

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:16,859
administration stability on the cost

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:19,140
efficiency and if possible low energy in

00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:23,759
our infrastructure we have two physical

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:27,749
servers for production and two for

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:32,759
testings actually where is just one

00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:40,549
server which is on because of our

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:44,939
environmental choice we use proxmox as a

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:50,539
operating system we have some Alexei

00:01:44,939 --> 00:02:04,679
containers and the proxmox is a Debian

00:01:50,539 --> 00:02:08,130
base all of system work with Alexei this

00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:14,990
is a this is a choice because with with

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:19,640
our first server this is a very low CPU

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:24,430
Ram and so on the we cannot have a

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:29,600
virtual machine on this is too much and

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:35,380
Alexei is the the very best choice

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:40,790
between between some servers I'm sorry

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:47,260
it's why we choice Debian because by

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:56,210
this is free we cannot do net neutrality

00:02:47,260 --> 00:03:00,310
we vote we vote transparency so it's

00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:03,500
impossible with some some proprietary

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:09,560
proprietary router

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:12,290
sorry there is a big community and this

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:21,290
is community right drivin this is not by

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:26,030
an enterprise and we don't see you

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:34,970
should be le choix do not hope he is I

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:38,200
don't know in English yes and this is a

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,280
very good stability and no cost because

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,990
she's not run net this is a

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:51,820
not-for-profit Association so for us it

00:03:44,990 --> 00:04:12,290
it's better we don't have physical with

00:03:51,820 --> 00:04:17,239
appliance this is in case of and it's

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:19,630
easy it's easiest if your route or

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,810
appliance crash

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:27,590
it's a problem because it's physical

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:31,040
with the gun it's it's only software on

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,370
we can take an another server in the

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
world

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:39,950
and we can put it in data center on

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:43,729
let's go and we want to - thanks our

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:48,080
person which contribute to Debian

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:54,350
because we've all that we cannot create

00:04:48,080 --> 00:05:03,580
our project on this infrastructure it's

00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:03,580
all questions

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:34,540
so the solution count about actually 40

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:40,250
member members and on the technical side

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:44,060
we are about three people we are

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:48,039
investing in the technical part and in

00:05:44,060 --> 00:06:03,400
the committee yes I think you say this

00:05:48,039 --> 00:06:06,860
we are four person actually ok yes yes

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,810
censorship in Switzerland which is not

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,810
that neutral and sub-points

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:21,200
yes I did I didn't understand really the

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,229
question in Switzerland many ISPs are

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:30,890
obliged to censor TNS so they like like

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:37,039
the law about casinos outside

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:39,260
Switzerland and stuff oh yes it's a it's

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,940
a big question about new

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:49,760
of the the yes for the the casino and

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:54,680
everything like that it's the big

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:59,390
question or on our side for no for no we

00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:03,710
did we didn't implemented anything for

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:07,550
that but in long term it's a question

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:13,100
with that we need to think about and to

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:16,550
list a net neutrality yes it's it's not

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:20,090
an easy question to answer because we

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:28,900
don't want to apply apply this but the

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:32,590
rod abridge la force force to apply

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:39,130
there is a section where is a low for

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:45,410
for money again and to to prevent some

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:50,830
some adjectives players to seduce noise

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:55,810
reduction yes to to access comes a some

00:07:50,830 --> 00:08:05,150
ESP need to to to blacklist with DNS

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:09,940
this is a legal problem for us but it it

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,940
turns well to your question okay

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,300
thank you very much for sharing your

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,740
talk with us I think is very important

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:24,500
what you are doing because neutrality in

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,100
internet nowadays is it's very important

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,800
and always has been very important but

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:35,599
we need to take care about most as

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,990
possible to the situations that have

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,560
been taking place for instance in United

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,450
States or in other countries so it is

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,100
great as you have shared this with us

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:52,700
and with Debian what

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:56,450
besides Debian which other free software

00:08:52,700 --> 00:09:02,390
are you using to run Sue's neutron which

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:06,200
other programs or free software why what

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:11,140
which which software are we running with

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:17,360
Debian yes throughout the routine we use

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:23,990
FF fruiting which is a fog of quagga

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:32,360
which is a this Rooter recipe for BGP

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:36,130
and for the for no we actually provide

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:42,970
any VPN connection and for this we use

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:45,440
Open VPN and for the more for an

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:51,170
infrastructure for the user management

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:56,410
and for the the website and everything

00:09:51,170 --> 00:10:02,840
like that we use Y universe which is a

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:07,370
distribution button on Debian which is

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:10,550
made for surfacing but it had it could

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,670
go see we use it for this because it's

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:19,100
really easier to insert some application

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:23,960
like a forum or a website or everything

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:28,130
like that and for the user for the

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:34,820
member management we use a coin which is

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:39,830
made from some internet provider in

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:43,100
France and yes I think it's so and yes

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:46,640
for the Dennis reservoir we use a wound

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,160
wound thank you very much for your

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,530
presentation we are out of time so we

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:57,760
are gonna yes thank you

00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:57,760
