I've been using Debian in production for more than 10 years, and this is a very strong love/hate relationship; what better than a MiniDebConf to vent, rant and hopefully share some good and less good practices amongst friends? Some keywords I'd like to touch on: staging, deployment, preseeding, terraform, puppet, unattended-upgrades, policy-rc.d, â€¦
