so welcome to PHP my admin tutorial by

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,219
DT is AK mark on Jerusalem hi and

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,910
welcome to the PHP turtle

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:19,970
PHP by PHP myadmin tutorial talk thanks

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,560
for introducing us so basically we will

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,680
will give a talk at the toriel about how

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,320
PHP myadmin works and will also explain

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,640
what PHP madman is so my first question

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,680
to the audience who knows PHP madman

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,879
right that's quite a few people almost

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,129
everybody who has ever used it all right

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,890
that's all the majority but I'm going to

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:47,879
the introduction anyway so

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,660
so what's PHP my admin basically it's

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,969
rip interface to manage MySQL database

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,890
MySQL database you can think I

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,379
configured it in a broad way so it's

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,629
actually the entire ecosystem so also

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,850
not only the MySQL original MySQL

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,820
database but also the MariaDB and a

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,990
drizzle virtual database which are

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,720
derived from the original MySQL it is a

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,150
web interface so it means that it's the

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,790
software is running on the on a web

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,670
server and communicates with a MySQL

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,310
database either on the same server or on

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,960
a separate server doesn't matter and you

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,540
interface interacts with the interface

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,380
using your web browser on your own PC it

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,119
certainly PHP and more and more Yahveh

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,490
script is being added over the years

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,530
because we were using more relying more

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,829
and more on JavaScript to make the

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,680
interface more dynamically with Ajax and

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:52,409
forms and then I'm at the updating of

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,909
data you can use it to browse the

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,509
information that's on the server try to

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,570
access tables and they and see what's in

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,360
it and update data and change data but

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,659
you can also use it to manage the server

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,170
for instance to manipulate or to change

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,170
the user

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:19,520
access levels for the for the users so

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:23,240
basic that's about it we exist for 15

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,150
years now in September our last major

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:30,470
release was in March of this year so

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,840
currently we're at subversion for and

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,970
virtual 4.1 is in development it will

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,300
probably be released somewhere in the

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:42,580
spring of next year the package we get

00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,650
is ships with about 20 languages and

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:50,200
several of them are being translated but

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:52,580
we only adds the language is that or

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,310
translates enough so that they can be

00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:00,170
added so how to get it of course on our

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,700
website you can download the package

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,440
it's also available for a lot of

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,110
distributions

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,560
it's available in DBM for instance but

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,800
also in fedora and in other

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,840
distributions it's also part of a lot of

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,810
packages like someone being cpanel and

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,440
of course you can get the latest version

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:24,350
on our git repository so that's for the

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,550
introduction I will now show a few basic

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:31,940
features of of PHP myadmin

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,519
so if you go to the login screen you see

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,519
something like this you just login with

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,030
your username this is actually the

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,350
username that's defined in demise in the

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:48,050
MySQL server so HP madman does not have

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,440
a separate list of user names and user

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,739
privileges it's it uses the credentials

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,110
you have and the rights you have in that

00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:02,860
are configured in the MySQL database I'm

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:05,269
that my server so you just log in and

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,480
then get something like this on the left

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:11,030
side you can see a navigation panel

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,820
listing all the all the databases and

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,799
you can click on them to show the tables

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,450
and on the right side you see the

00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,700
information you are actually looking for

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,720
so I will first show you

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,790
[Music]

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,090
how to create a database so you go to

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,600
databases that makes sense I think and

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:34,570
then in the create database field you

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:42,700
just type a name so well that's just

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:48,370
tutorial and then create and as you can

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:50,830
see in the list here the test tutorial

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,720
database was added and also in the on

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,750
the left side in the navigation panel

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,920
you don't see it yet because there's a

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,900
feature that collapses that'll be a

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,480
database that I've assumed I have the

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,520
same prefix you can configure how this

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,230
works but I'm not going into detail

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,750
there but you can see that the database

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:13,960
is there so now we'll go into data into

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,450
that database and to create a table I

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,060
will minimize the navigation panel to

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:30,490
have a bit more room or create table

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:35,940
tests and add two columns go should be

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,940
busy there is

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,200
so now you can define the type of table

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:48,830
add the type of of columns so I will

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:54,650
create an index and a value value I'll

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:56,570
make you a fair share of AIDS here again

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,850
which storage engine you can choose

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,040
which storage engine to use for this

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:06,170
case I will use in ODB but you can use

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:09,100
any one you like and then for index I

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:16,610
will define the primary and that's

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:18,400
automatic indexing and then save now the

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,290
table is created so if you go back

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:26,000
you'll see here that there is this table

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,150
and if you go to string if you go to

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
structure you can see that we have an ID

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,610
and a value and if you go to indexes

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,690
you'll see that a primary index has been

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,100
created for the ID for the ID column so

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,470
currently there's nothing if you click

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:48,290
browse there's nothing there so you can

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:50,480
with insert you can add data because the

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,160
index index auto is automatically

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,330
created so I'm not going to feel

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,800
anything in just don't take foo and bar

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,260
[Music]

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,390
you see that the ignore thing was I

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,430
automatically disappeared once you start

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:08,360
typing in the second fields so I'm going

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:10,370
to insert two records at once so you can

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,210
see now that they have been inserted and

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:17,080
if you go to the Browse you can see that

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,490
there are two records now in the table

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,400
another feature I would like like to add

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,710
a show is how to browse data I'm going

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,800
to take a different database because

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:33,940
there are more tables there so I'll go

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,940
to the employee database tables

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,930
a PCS bit slow so so here you see a lot

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:51,890
of time quite a lot of tables I imagine

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,210
you have a database you had a table with

00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,060
fifteen or twenty fields but you're only

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,850
interested in three but they're all

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,530
there at the back of the over the eye of

00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,660
the list then not on the screen and then

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,570
it's difficult so there's a possibility

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,420
of dragging I changing the order so you

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:13,920
can move over it and drag it to another

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:18,210
place and then the column moves there's

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,640
also a possibility of hiding tables so

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,430
press on this arrow and then you get a

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,680
list of all the tables and just then

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,290
mark the ones that you don't want and

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,390
then they disappear or you can just

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,630
click on show all and then they appear

00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,830
again another nice feature that was

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,050
added in version 4 is that you can edit

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,210
that records like you would edit the

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:46,500
spreadsheet so it just double-click on

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:49,260
on a field and then you can change the

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,050
data I change the records it enter and

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,170
then that field will be will be updated

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,180
you can also use the edit button button

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,550
you'll get a big big form with all the

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,370
with all the entries and then this is

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,200
much more easier much faster than using

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,830
the edit form if you just want to change

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,400
one one record so that was about adding

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:14,820
and changing data now I'm going to show

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:19,980
you bits about user management's you

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:22,860
have to go back to the server level so

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,950
there's a tab called users used to be

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,270
called privileges in a previous version

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,740
so there you see a list of all the users

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:33,150
that are defined for this database

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,280
server so without user you can create a

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:42,660
new user you will get a form so it type

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:46,320
a name this tutorial for any host will

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,210
take local hosts and then generates you

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
can you can see that that general a

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,050
password is generated you supposed to

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,820
copy this and store it somewhere to be

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,540
able to login later but I will not do

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,350
this because

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:02,260
it's not necessary for the tutorial you

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,070
can define the the rights that the user

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,810
has on on the database that the entire

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,520
database servers or all the tables but

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,970
you can also and I'm going to show that

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,890
show you that's after adding the user so

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,260
now that user this edits so you can see

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,780
in at least this tutorial this user has

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:25,180
been created and if you go to edit

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:26,880
privileges scroll down a bit you can see

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,670
there are two base specific privileges

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,250
and here you can select a database for

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:38,980
instance this tutorial database and they

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:41,140
can grant all the all the privileges on

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,820
that only on that database and then that

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,030
user will only have access to that

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:49,720
database but not to the the rest of the

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:51,580
server so that's about it for me now

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,530
Isaac will come up and we'll show you

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,530
some more advanced features

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:10,069
thank you hi I'm Isaac and I'm going to

00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:12,639
show you a couple quick ways that we can

00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:16,249
deal with foreign key relations within

00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,789
my sequel's yes within my sequel there

00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:22,369
are there's a way to create foreign key

00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:24,919
relations if you're using the nodb table

00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:27,399
type and that's one way that we work

00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,889
towards getting a normalized database as

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:33,589
you can see here in our example employs

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:36,889
database we've got a list of departments

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:40,189
and also employs both of which are

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:42,739
simply the name and the corresponding ID

00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:46,129
number and then we've got a series of

00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:49,609
other tables which actually relate the

00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:51,529
data it takes the employee ID and the

00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:54,019
department ID and then in this

00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:57,529
particular case it has excuse me the

00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:59,359
from and to date for when the employee

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:01,539
was associated with that department and

00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,579
this is one of the ways that we

00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:06,199
normalized the data so that if you have

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,789
an employee who changes departments you

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:09,439
don't have to enter them twice into the

00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:12,350
employee database you just create

00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:14,329
another entry here so one of the things

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,239
that we have that enables you to work

00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,609
with relations is the relation view and

00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:21,169
if you go under the structure tab you

00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:25,819
can see the relation view link right

00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:28,459
here and the neat thing that PHP myadmin

00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:30,679
allows you to do is to create a relation

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,410
even if you're not using the nodb table

00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,329
through the configuration storage

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,989
feature which is something that we set

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:40,579
up to store additional features for

00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:43,879
bookmarking or user level preferences or

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:45,409
in this case relations you can go

00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,649
through and you can define relations

00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:51,439
even if the my sequel table doesn't

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,789
support it by default but anyway here in

00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:56,179
relations you can see that we've already

00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:57,679
got two defined and setting one is as

00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:01,429
easy as selecting it from the drop-down

00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:03,979
and just selecting go and in this case

00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:07,449
we're going to turn on oh no we're not

00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:12,050
gonna do that there I apologize

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:16,869
we're going to go to departments

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:22,129
and I'm going to turn on the show column

00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:25,100
one more button click away the column to

00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:26,779
display is another feature that marks

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,029
going to get into a little bit and I

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:32,209
will show you also as well that allows

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:37,249
us to make inserting and displaying data

00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:41,269
much easier because when you go to when

00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:43,970
you go to the related data back in the

00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,069
department and employee database alright

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,429
sorry the table that relates those

00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:51,319
together if we go to insert a row you'll

00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,749
see that there's a drop-down provided

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:56,600
where you can pick from if you know the

00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:58,549
text representation or the value you can

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,009
simply select customer service or if you

00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:02,720
know that it's ID number D zero zero

00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:04,879
five you can select that from the list

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,040
so we give it to you both ways as the

00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,019
foreign key and the related key and that

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,230
makes it much easier for you to insert

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,819
data on the fly now there's another way

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,980
of working with relations that we've got

00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:19,429
and that's called the designer feature

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,350
which is a graphical way and in this

00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:23,389
case it's stuck under the more tab if

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,339
you've got your resolution set higher if

00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,709
you're not doing a presentation for

00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:30,139
instance this more tab actually expands

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,019
out and that's dynamically based on the

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,579
size of your your display so in this

00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,970
case it's under the more tab but it's

00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:39,439
down in the end for designer and when we

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,420
open that up that's going to give us a

00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:44,119
graphical representation of all of our

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,309
relations in this database and what you

00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:48,470
can do is move those tables around to a

00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:49,999
way that suits the way your dad is

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,619
displayed for instance I'm not

00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,990
interested in this log so I'm going to

00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:57,230
minimize that and drag that out of the

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,929
way and now I've got a suitable

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:03,079
representation of all of the relations

00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:06,709
between my database and within this

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,989
designer if I want to save this later

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:10,879
all I have to do is hit save and it

00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:12,619
saves the layout on that page and so the

00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,529
next time I go into designer it'll save

00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:17,809
that specific layout so anyway when you

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,509
want to create or remove a relation it's

00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:23,929
quite easy all you've got to do is in

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,649
this case we'll remove this simply by

00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:27,089
clicking on the relation and

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,389
a little prompt if I want to delete a

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,279
relation and then to add a relation is

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,529
as easy as selecting the add button and

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:37,170
then click in between the two keys you

00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,720
want to relate and in this case it's

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:45,089
asking me what I want to do if the

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:47,339
foreign key is manipulated and will it

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:51,019
didn't like that for some reason so

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,019
that's how you create the relation

00:15:53,149 --> 00:16:09,959
within the designer anyway so you get

00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:11,759
the picture of that then the final thing

00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,550
that I'm going to show you about is the

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,019
import and export coordinates what we

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,170
can do is take the coordinates directly

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:23,730
from this designer view and move them to

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:27,089
a page for export as a PDF or SVG or dia

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:37,999
graphic file and we're going to create a

00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:37,999
new tutorial page here and then from the

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:49,769
selected there we go and then when we go

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,660
back to the operations tab for that

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,350
database we're going to be able to

00:16:51,660 --> 00:17:00,360
export the entire database schema and

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:02,519
the relation view as a PDF file so here

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,000
we're going to select the page that we

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,679
just created the tutorial and once we

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,220
select that it's going to automatically

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,140
fill in with all the coordinates in this

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,159
text field no I don't like typing the

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,289
text field and I have trouble

00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,819
visualizing those so all I'm going to do

00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,620
is toggle the scratchboard and that's

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,049
going to bring up a graphical

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,789
representation again very similar to the

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:27,510
designer and you can drag those around

00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:30,659
to match your page layout and how you

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,190
wish to export the page and as you drag

00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:35,220
those around it's going to automatically

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,260
update the X&Y coordinates in these text

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,450
boxes so let's say we're happy with that

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,909
and we're going to come down here and

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,559
select the export type as I said you can

00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:46,710
export as several different vector

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:49,740
graphics formats but I find PDF the

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,630
easiest for my purposes and then if you

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,580
are in a country that requires you to

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,409
use letter or legal paper you could

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,880
select that there we're just going to go

00:17:55,409 --> 00:18:01,230
PDF a4 and this is going to export for

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,330
us and I'll show you in just a moment

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,590
that it gives you a very nice view of

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:10,139
all of your tables and all of the excuse

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,320
me one second it's going to give you an

00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:15,210
overview of each type of data that's

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,340
represented in each table and then it's

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:22,950
also going to show you all the relations

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:26,179
so I'm going to switch back to this and

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,919
zoom in a little bit so you can see

00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:32,279
there is the table of contents which

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,169
shows you each table in the export here

00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:38,370
and if you click on one it Scrolls you

00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:39,840
directly there so when I click when I'm

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,110
sorry when i zoom this in for you you

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,870
can see that the column shows each

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,269
column has the type if there's a default

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,980
any extra as the comments every every

00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:53,309
bit of information you need to recreate

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,139
this or to document your procedures this

00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:58,169
makes it very easy to create a database

00:18:55,139 --> 00:19:01,019
and then see for documentation purposes

00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:02,940
what exists in the database and then

00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,580
down at the very bottom we've got the

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,190
list of relations between each field and

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,590
so this creates a very nice display that

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,659
you can document for future generations

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,490
and see what your database looked like

00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:16,220
and now for a little bit more I'm going

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:20,580
to turn it over to mark who's going to

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:23,210
do some more on the advanced features of

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,210
phpMyAdmin

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:37,410
well thank you my name is Mark and I

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,370
will I'm happy to show you four features

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:44,820
today the photo handling how to insert

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:48,840
or how to display a photo from the

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:51,900
database also how to do a zoom search to

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,510
to have a big picture of your table how

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,950
to display relational data that Isaac

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:01,770
just show showed us how to to relate

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:06,180
them but how we can benefit from this

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:11,940
and how to display Geographic data from

00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:13,920
GIS support in MySQL okay so let's start

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:20,970
with the photo handling we have our

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:26,190
employees table right here and we have

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:30,260
inside it a column called photo and the

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:33,390
data type is long blob which means that

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:36,960
MySQL database can hold also non-textual

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:43,160
things like in the like binary things

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:47,130
like image or audio in the full

00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:52,380
structure of this column we see that

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,250
there is there are two extra pieces of

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,670
information

00:20:53,250 --> 00:21:01,160
one is the mime type so if we want to be

00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:04,320
able to display this data we will select

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:08,940
image JPEG because we plan to put JPEG

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,640
images into this column and we also want

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,980
to transform the data when we are

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:19,050
browsing the table so we want to apply

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:22,710
an inline display so we want to see the

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:25,410
JPEGs when we browse the table but now

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:29,250
we don't have any pictures into this

00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:36,120
table when we browse the table we only

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:38,340
see that the photo column is empty it

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,720
could contain blobs but there are

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:46,820
nothing yep so we edit

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:49,280
this employee and what I'm gonna do is

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,190
to pick a picture that is on my

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,360
workstation I will upload it into the

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:59,780
row so I will send it to the to the web

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:07,280
server which will send it to the MySQL

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:20,210
server so I browse my filesystem locally

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:22,790
I will choose this picture here so now

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:26,330
it is set to be uploaded when I click go

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:28,790
it goes to the web server and by the way

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,070
the web server could be it could not be

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,560
and not local

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:41,000
so it join it generated an update

00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:46,610
statement and then when I make a little

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,710
room here when I browse the page I see a

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,680
thumbnail that is generated it's not

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:55,690
stored it's generated on the fly and I

00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,690
can access the full picture too

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:10,389
okay now we'll go back to our list of

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:14,230
tables and in the employees database we

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:20,529
have a salaries table which shows for

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:28,510
each employee the the time when it

00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:30,370
changed when the celery changed okay but

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,639
looking like that I don't see much

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:36,130
information I got the raw data but I

00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:38,740
don't see the big picture of the trend

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:43,149
of the salaries so to be able to see

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:50,440
that I will go to search then I'll

00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:53,950
choose zoom search so this will enable

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:59,409
me to generate a plot of two columns so

00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:06,610
I'll pick the from date column and the

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:09,450
salary column and on the plot I want to

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,639
label each data point so let's pick

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:17,519
employee number as the label for each

00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:21,549
point now if I have a huge table

00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:25,870
generating this plot could could use a

00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:32,620
lot of memory in my browser so I should

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:35,620
really restrain myself to a little

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,320
number of rows but it depends on your

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,919
memory on your system in your

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,919
workstation

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:53,980
so now I see that I have about 100 there

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:56,830
points I see the Train of my salary's

00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,760
that they are going up in it's very very

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:03,460
interesting to see but it's called zoom

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:08,290
search because you can pick a region of

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:11,340
the graph for this year for example and

00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:15,970
I have more detailed information about

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:19,330
the dots I have the employee number that

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:24,370
appears like that and I click I can

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:27,310
click on a dot to edit the this row of

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:34,510
data and I could increase my salary and

00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:37,750
change it what I want with that next I

00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:41,650
would like to show you the how you can

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:45,100
benefit from the relational Association

00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:53,650
we did between the employees and the

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:56,850
department's tables so in the department

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,850
employees table

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:07,860
now we see only the employee numbers and

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:10,660
Department numbers only the keys and

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,650
what if I don't remember what is

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:17,050
department five one thing I can do if I

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:22,390
just want to to look at one department

00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:26,140
is to click and follow the link which

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:28,720
brings me to the department table for

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,150
this department and I can see here the

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,870
name but it could be telephone number or

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:41,070
something but it's not very convenient

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:46,570
if I need to do many many times the same

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:49,120
operation so let's use another way to be

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:52,510
able to see all this related data at a

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,140
glance I will use a display option here

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:59,830
which is hidden by default so by by

00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,470
default we see the relation no keys if I

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,830
click on relational display column this

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:09,370
is a column that describes a department

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:13,720
or that describes an employee so in this

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:21,220
case the department name and the

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:26,020
employee name last name okay my last

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:31,120
feature is to talk about GIS so GIS

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:36,790
means geographic information system so

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:40,120
it's a system to manage data that

00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:45,700
relates to geography like coordinates on

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:50,650
a map and MySQL supports this kind of

00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:54,370
data as well as normal text or numeric

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:57,720
data so let's open this other database I

00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:59,830
have a table called capitals that

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,540
contains the coordinates for each

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:08,260
capital of the world

00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:13,260
or many capitals at least and here we

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:18,970
only see that it's contains spatial data

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:21,940
it's only it's 25 bytes but I don't see

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:25,450
exactly what it contains so again we go

00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:29,400
to the display options and we will use a

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:33,600
format called well-known text which is

00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:38,170
which is the markup language for

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:42,100
geographic data so with that we see that

00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:47,080
it contains point point data with

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:50,110
coordinates and let's try to see what

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:55,350
all these coordinates mean so we can go

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,350
down there and click visualize GIS data

00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:04,500
so we see more or less they can't the

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:07,540
form of the continents with the cities

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:11,920
coordinates of the Capitals display

00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:15,340
there to be able to better see the where

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:18,070
they are located we will call open

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:23,440
street maps and we now we get an layer

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:30,610
of the map we have this kind of layer or

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:35,590
a satellite-based layer like that and we

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:41,880
can we can zoom in if we want down to

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:53,870
the street level of each city thank you

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:58,240
I'll invite Ruslan ok thank you mark

00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:02,450
and I will briefly talk to you about

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,929
routines and triggers and events in

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:08,870
phpMyAdmin as well as the server status

00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:12,490
monitor okay know so who knows where the

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:14,690
stored procedure is raise your hand okay

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,270
everybody knows so maybe I don't even

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:20,360
need to explain but well anyway uhm it's

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,340
a feature of a relational database that

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,860
allows you to store a bunch of SQL code

00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:31,370
on the server and then just call that

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:37,909
code to execute it okay so you know

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:41,600
employees database we can navigate to

00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:43,789
the routines tab which encompasses both

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,620
start procedure in stored functions

00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:48,830
there's a few subtle difference but I

00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,720
won't get into that now to create a new

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,230
routine you can click on this link over

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,890
here and it brings up a dialog where we

00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,600
can fill in all the necessary data but

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,309
it's a risk of this sounding like a

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,919
cooking show and here's one that I

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:09,440
prepared earlier here we go it's a very

00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,000
simple one it's called tutorial and we

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,860
have two parameters and we have an input

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,809
parameter and an out parameter and

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,029
basically what this does is take the

00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:22,970
input parameter incremented by one and

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:25,730
then put it into the output parameter so

00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,830
that's a very simple one but stored

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:31,419
procedures can be very complex and they

00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:38,110
could even be hundreds of lines of code

00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:41,149
okay next we have triggers and triggers

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:43,520
again a feature of MySQL that allows us

00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,149
to execute a bunch of SQL code whenever

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,240
certain event happens in the database a

00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:53,929
very common use case for this is logging

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,390
so for example I will show you that we

00:31:53,929 --> 00:32:05,450
have a trigger again in the employees

00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:07,490
database in the department's table now

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:13,220
again this can be found here

00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:15,799
in the trigger stab and if we have a

00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,590
quick look at it and what we can see is

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:21,169
that after every insert in the

00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,970
Department stable Ella will execute the

00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:27,049
code there you can see in the definition

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:29,390
text area and what it will do is it will

00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:32,270
insert a new row of data into the log

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:34,279
table that will tell us when a

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:41,000
particular Department has been added to

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:46,190
the system so if I go ahead and insert

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,289
in your into the departments and we're

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:56,630
put in as a number one two three four

00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:58,549
and we call it computing so a new row

00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:02,929
has been inserted into the department's

00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:06,010
table and we can go and quickly check if

00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:09,919
we have a new row in the log table and

00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:11,390
as you can see here it is and in the

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,000
timestamp we can see that it's been

00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:18,740
inserted well roughly about now and

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,090
that's all about triggers and moving on

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:25,120
we have events events well that's

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:29,450
something that allows us to execute

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,909
again a bunch of SQL code either at some

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:37,580
point in time or we can set up recurrent

00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:40,520
events that are triggered has selected

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:43,159
intervals of time now you can access

00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:46,760
them directly here or we can also go to

00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:51,649
the database level and we will have a

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:54,140
tab for events there it is right there

00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:56,179
and we can see that there is an event

00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,610
already there however it will not be

00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:01,370
executed because in order for the events

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,770
to work the event scheduler must be

00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,870
enabled now if you don't own the actual

00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:08,720
MySQL server that might be a problem

00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:12,619
because enabling it requires the super

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,159
user privilege so here we have it it's

00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:19,790
been enabled and if we have a quick look

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,169
at this event here we can see that it's

00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,409
an event that will clear the

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:27,740
table at the end of this month for some

00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:31,490
reason and we can also have recurrent

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:34,069
events like I mentioned earlier and so

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,899
if we go here into the add event and we

00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:38,029
change the event type from one time to

00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:41,029
recurring we can see that the dialog

00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:43,190
changes slightly and we can configure

00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:46,940
when we want the event to be running

00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:53,059
from - and we can also specify how often

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:54,889
we would like to execute it now that

00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:57,139
would be all about events and again

00:34:54,889 --> 00:35:01,940
moving on I will just briefly show you

00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:04,010
the our service status manager now it

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:09,049
can be reached from the status tab on

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:12,049
the home page and it will show on the on

00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:14,990
the first page some statistics about the

00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:17,930
traffic and the connections and the

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,760
processes of the server now there also

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,470
sub tabs here that show other

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,539
information for example the query

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,220
statistics allows you to see what type

00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:29,240
of query is actually being run on your

00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:32,710
server so here we can see that the most

00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:35,390
often executed query is of type select

00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:38,119
but if we scroll down here we can also

00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:41,690
see a pie chart which visualizes the

00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:44,920
data mentioning another thing that we

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,839
can see here is the status variables and

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,940
we can use the the information that is

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,829
shown on this page to perhaps diagnose

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,789
any performance issues that we might be

00:35:51,829 --> 00:36:00,700
having on the server also we have a

00:35:55,789 --> 00:36:03,980
monitor tab now this is a fun feature

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,200
because we get to see some charts that

00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,799
show us in real time what is happening

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,660
to our server now in the settings we can

00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:13,160
change the refresh rate and the number

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,140
of columns here I have to change it

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,299
because three don't actually fit on this

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,089
tiny screen so we're just going to go

00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:22,670
for two now we can see what is happening

00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:24,589
at the moment here we can see the amount

00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,150
of queries that are being run the amount

00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:28,549
of connections and the processes that

00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,799
are running the traffic system CPU usage

00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:33,430
swap and system memory but you can also

00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:35,980
add your own charts

00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:39,880
and to make this more useful we can go

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:42,070
into the setup page and change a few

00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,590
settings on the server now this will

00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,360
slightly sew down the server so as soon

00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,860
as you finished analyzing what is

00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:55,540
happening on the server you might want

00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:58,480
to turn this back off okay excellent

00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,630
No what I'll do is I will just open up

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:13,470
another table somewhere and that should

00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:17,170
trigger a select statement as we can see

00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:20,340
there's been a spike right here both in

00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:22,870
the traffic tab and in the questions tab

00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,580
and what we can do at this point we can

00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,470
get actually more information about what

00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,630
has been happening here if we just click

00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:34,890
and drag and we can select a particular

00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:39,340
time span okay that didn't work out to

00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:41,770
try this again here we go now we can

00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,360
pull from the log what kind of queries

00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,760
have been running at that particular

00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,910
time we can see there's been 87 selected

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,070
queries and if we jump to the log table

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,690
it'll show us the information about the

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,250
queries now if you actually click on the

00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,560
individual queries you can run an

00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:01,230
analysis that will tell you if it's

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:04,330
possible to improve the performance and

00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:08,440
last but not least we have the advisor

00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:12,340
tab which runs a set of predefined rules

00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,990
against the server to diagnose if there

00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,500
might be any kind of problems on the

00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:22,150
server okay and this actually concludes

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:23,440
our talk on the PHP myadmin and thank

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,270
you very much for listening and I

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,980
believe we don't actually have any time

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:30,280
for questions but if you're interested

00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:35,290
we're going to be outside and we'll we

00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,790
can take them there oh wait oh we have

00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:43,990
seven minutes so does brilliant we're

00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:45,560
okay okay any questions okay that didn't

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,060
really change anything did it

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,510
okay thank you very much for coming and

00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:53,689
listening to us thank you

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:53,689
