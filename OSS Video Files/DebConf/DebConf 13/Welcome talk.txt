the network team you have to especially

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:38,239
thank Raphael and Filipe they did most

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,100
of the financing in the background they

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:52,600
found all the money that this is

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:52,600
possible here and we have Gardens

00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,979
[Applause]

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,450
we also want to thank for people that

00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,560
are unfortunately not yet here and the

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,450
persons of Kenneth goon are gizmo and

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,550
Richard artists that all have

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:28,320
contributed quite a lot for the success

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:31,170
of this Kampf and but so some practical

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,440
information you may probably have

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,240
already seen most a bit of the venue but

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,030
you can find this plan on the napkin

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,459
quickie in case but we are now in the

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,150
bottom of Plan C panel which is the main

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:48,930
talk room and the dining room and some

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:52,860
sleeping rooms also hopefully a and

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:55,290
singly the two upper ones here our

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,630
sleeping rooms and in single you have

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,660
two hot clubs and the private Seneca

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,750
Club if you want to stare at blue screen

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,860
instead of your screen there are the hot

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,650
club in number eight bar you probably

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,480
already found up upstairs of rotones

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,900
downstairs you have the second talk room

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,570
and front desk we have the bathrooms

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,500
there is one bathroom downstairs here

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,830
and one bathroom in Pascal and there's

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,040
the main Hot Club in Curry and I think

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,160
that's okay but probably interesting is

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,520
also in this row of building

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,640
if the skinny cath lab is full up there

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,310
there are lots of in official skinny cap

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,880
labs as well with basically the same

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,440
view and this and Wi-Fi yes and this

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,169
second bathroom

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,260
there will be no scheduled events there

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:55,080
so this is the room you can just use if

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,120
you want to gather together and talk

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,280
about something and there's a projector

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,280
there available for use if you need it

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:09,270
four times so your hot breakfasts it

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,169

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:32,099
you know Switzerland quiet sounds as you

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:34,169
have seen there are people sleeping all

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,210
around the place

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,550
so after sunset please stay quiet

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,060
outside so that people can enjoy their

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,759
sleep

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,069
how clubs are also meant as workplaces

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,009
so please keep your loud discussions

00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:50,189
such as that for outdoor high class

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,020
please and if if needed if that doesn't

00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,180
work please just gently ask people to

00:05:52,020 --> 00:06:09,449
stop or to move somewhere else so that

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:12,330
everyone can stay happy in the bar so

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,580
kitchens and cups as you have maybe seen

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,710
in some of the buildings there are small

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,169
kitchens available they are free for use

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,879
for everyone just keep clean up after

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,310
yourself because we will be the ones

00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,639
cleaning them if you don't so thank you

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,250
in advance and empty cups the bar

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,990
delivers DEFCON 13 cups we all know they

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,149
are very very nice but the bar needs

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,580
them to continue providing beers so

00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:38,310
please bring their cups back at when you

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,039
finished your beer or something else but

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,740
you can take one for at home for free at

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,770
the end of that conf but don't bring it

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,589
into your room before the end and rooms

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,659
and all common spaces are under the

00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:55,550
common responsibility so keep them clean

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:55,550
clean it's not that hard

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:09,270
that's DEFCON standards of respect I

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,520
think they're on the websites in step

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:15,569
count 10 so that's not really a new

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,860
thing if there's any problem with them

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:24,289
or you can write to this address

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:26,499
anti-harassment at Debian door and there

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:30,020
we'll be people they are answering you

00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:32,210
it's not going to the orga team directly

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,949
so you can also use it if you have a

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,949
problem with someone from the Orca team

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,849
yeah you can also directly talk to the

00:07:41,629 --> 00:08:02,809
orga team if you want that's just a more

00:07:43,849 --> 00:08:03,590
private right thank you and now for

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,110
Switzerland could be an discipline

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:49,920
Switzerland is seen as banks and secrecy

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:52,320
