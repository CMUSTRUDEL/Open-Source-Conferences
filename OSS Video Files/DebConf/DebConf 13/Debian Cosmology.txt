okay and now for the last talk in the

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,410
morning session

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,009
Joey Hess will talk about Debian

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,009
cosmology

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,630
well thanks good morning everybody I

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,189
hope you had a good night's sleep I

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,260
enjoyed sleeping out in the tent in the

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,720
middle of Switzerland looking out over

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,400
the lake and this is kind of the first

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,960
step gone far I've kind of had a problem

00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,390
if I just look over there I've really

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,090
just you know lose focus for a minute

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,870
it's so gorgeous I thought this would be

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,580
a good a good place to you know get up

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,000
on a mountaintop as it were and think

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,339
about the bigger picture and you know

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,470
try to think about you know some of the

00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:57,449
big questions the big big things that we

00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,059
wonder about that don't really sometimes

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,850
talk about maybe in public in front of a

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,670
live streaming audience I don't know so

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,880
I have this crazy Debian cosmology idea

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,470
and let's look at Debian you know let's

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,070
look at the universal operating system

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,930
and you know think about you know

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,670
thinking back 20 years back to when

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,100
Debian was founded it up to the present

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,369
and where it's gonna go from here

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:27,030
so back in the beginning there was kind

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:32,490
of this void you know and there was a

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:35,670
there was a gap yeah thanks and Ian

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,370
Murdoch saw this and he said well you

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,250
know let's make a new Linux distribution

00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,030
to replace SLS it'll be great I'll get

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:50,490
it done in a couple of weeks you know

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:52,470
and this was back in 1993 and you know

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,240
just just as with the Big Bang

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,610
you have the laws of nature somehow

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,090
forming out of the void we developed

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,380
these standard principles of Debian that

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,700
are pretty much stood the test of time

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,350
are those some of them like the one

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,590
packaged one maintainer thing have

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,390
changed over time but you know we kind

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,879
of we you know this is all the stuff

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,330
that we think of as the core principles

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,069
of Debian today probably you know and

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,019
this was kind of in the period of 94 to

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,489
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,959
you know this early period where there

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,909
weren't very many people involved in

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,970
Debian and things got done fairly

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,709
quickly I have down here the one of the

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,720
initial threads for the Debian

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,180
Constitution this is where

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,030
and Jackson said you know I think we'll

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,130
use this Constitution proposal as to

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,720
bootstrap the Constitution so we'll vote

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,520
on the Constitution using the principles

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,350
of the Constitution that could be a kind

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,030
of controversial thing to say actually

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,220
because you know it's it's a

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,030
bootstrapping problem but you know the

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,860
thread actually wasn't that long by I

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,480
would say by today's standards for

00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,310
something that important right so you

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,500
know this was as I said the early period

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,940
and then in the late 90s and early 2000s

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,040
we went through this inflation period

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,870
just like the universe blew up got

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,580
bigger and bigger you know we have the

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,190
nice up into the right graph which is

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,060
the number of maintained errs over time

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,800
and you know I don't think that this

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,480
data is very good but I'm kind of happy

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,700
to see that it started going up again in

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,500
the most recent election though that's

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,580
probably also just because Zack wasn't

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,410
running so you know during this

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,860
inflation period we had things happen

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,650
like adding ports a Debian one port in

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,050
98 two ports in 99 two ports in 2000

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,440
that's two ports a year you know it's

00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:47,230
it's a crazy rate of change and then we

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,790
had all these derivatives started

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,530
popping up we have had Debian four hams

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,880
for a while but you know we got these

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,540
derivatives that you don't think of much

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,950
anymore like corel linux store mix

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,350
progeny these are these are names we

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,090
haven't mentioned in a while but they

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,769
were the early you know corporate

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,900
entities saying well we're gonna try to

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,300
do something here with Debian and modify

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,989
it and of course more many more came

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,290
from there and another big event in this

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:17,820
period was that apt started out and this

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,470
is one of the early threads about apt

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,970
this is about a year after it started

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,040
being developed everybody started trying

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,200
it and realized oh it actually doesn't

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,140
work on my system because I have these

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,700
packages that are half configured I have

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,260
a few broken dependencies because I just

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,970
forced something at some point and

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,010
everybody tried after they're like gosh

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,729
it says my systems inconsistent and it

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:42,250
doesn't have a pet - effing yet so it

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,890
doesn't work and so I thought this was

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,670
an amusing thread it's also not really

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,730
too long it

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,740
red but you know here's the here's an

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,940
introductory or a representative message

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,740
I don't know if you can read it back

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,780
there but you know it's just what I said

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,550
Afghan doesn't seem to work it says my

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,530
system lacks integrity and then Jason

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,910
Gunn Thorpe who wrote app said well you

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,980
know I don't think I've actually seen a

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,840
Debian system that that is it has a

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:09,700
perfect dependency set up so that app

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,800
can actually work on it and you know if

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,680
you think about introducing some big new

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,170
change like app doesn't work at all and

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,570
this was in April of 1998 if we then

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,940
move forward one month to May in 1998

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,500
here's somebody saying this makes me

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,690
wonder if we should think about dropping

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,460
this Auto app script that we're using

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,820
for upgrades some kind of a shell script

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,010
or something and switch to act Auto it

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,220
seems to work and maybe we shouldn't

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,270
postpone Debian 2.0 for apt but Auto ops

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,210
a hack and apt is what you do an entire

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,890
bodiham upgrade in deselect Wow

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,330
I was kind of surprised to see this it

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,790
turns out I wrote that I had no idea

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,800
that I proposed converting Debian to app

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,710
for 2.0 you know it didn't actually

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,380
happen in May in 1998 we had to wait a

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,570
whole year until March of 99 when 2.1

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,670
came out and this is a quote from Debian

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,680
history about apt which I thought was a

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,360
great quote it established a new

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,630
paradigm for package acquisition

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:11,680
installation and it really did you know

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,240
if you look now at things that are

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,460
basically command-line compatible with

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,080
apt or more or less command-line

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,830
compatible maybe these they didn't quite

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,230
understand the difference between

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,770
upgrade and update there's so many of

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,390
them it's crazy and one of the

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,250
interesting things about this list is if

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,250
you look at and see which ones of these

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:34,600
actually do it securely it's a really

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:37,480
small subset and you know maybe some of

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,890
them use HTTP in some way and have a

00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,390
little bit of security there I don't

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:46,390
know I didn't check them all in detail

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,290
but of course back then app didn't have

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,630
any security either

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,980
it was just point stuff be HTTP off the

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:56,170
web and hey it'd be the right thing

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:58,330
because why wouldn't it be so you know

00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,440
soon after app came out this is a

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,200
screenshot from 2000

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,540
- but it was around earlier we got a pet

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,050
dog work which was all these third-party

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,370
apps repositories and this was kind of

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,930
interesting there were hundreds of

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,700
different repositories you could go off

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,850
and your sources about lists get your

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,190
packages and we kind of started thinking

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,260
wow maybe we're gonna change how Debian

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,840
works in some way maybe we'll have some

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,400
kind of a central core and you know

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,530
everything else will just be pulling

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,990
from other repositories somewhere and we

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,430
kind of went off on a divergent paths we

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,800
kind of went down a wormhole to some

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,830
kind of a distributed app or app store

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,210
model where you know there's Debian and

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,620
there's all the stuff that you pull in

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,780
from here and there and if somebody

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,090
wants to make a package they do and this

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,520
kind of is what happened today - you can

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,040
pull you know sign packages from Google

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,860
and from you know Debian multiple media

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,600
or Deb multimedia that kind of thing but

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,740
we didn't really go down that path we're

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,390
still very much a centralized

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,710
distribution I kind of think it's

00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,910
interesting to think about what could

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,100
have happened if we branched off a

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,900
different way there but you know there

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,880
were good reasons to keep it centralized

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,950
such as security and if you now

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,669
fast-forward to the present

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,860
here's a pet org from 2011 it's been

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,300
broken we can't check if these

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,310
repositories work anymore we're not

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,690
accepting new submissions and this is

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,690
what happened to Debbie and multimedia

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,419
org which is a pity but you know it's a

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:27,340
Russian domain about motorcycles or

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:31,090
something I don't know so so that's kind

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,910
of the inflation period of Debian and

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:37,289
then we can move forward again into the

00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:40,120
modern era and this might be where my

00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:44,890
cosmology analogy gets a little bit

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,500
strained but we'll see so I think you

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,150
can see - you can I picked out two

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,440
things about the modern era of Debian

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,820
you know this past ten years or 15 years

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,190
so one of them just was in the universe

00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,450
you have more skill structures you know

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:05,050
forming you know galaxies and larger

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,000
larger structures in Debian we've kind

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,530
of developed all kinds of structures on

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,600
top of the one maintainer one package

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,250
model and extending it and going beyond

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,190
it

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,530
so a few of these you know the team's

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,570
Lucas showed us you know the graph of

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,360
team maintenance increasing over the

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,980
past 10 years or so and you know we we

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,240
just developed all these structures you

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,790
know custom Debian distributions you

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,620
know stuff like bi different projects

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,810
within Debian and so it gets pretty

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,480
complicated it's not a it's not a it's

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,980
not a heterogeneous thing it's or a

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,960
homogeneous thing it's all clumped

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,030
around in different places and we are if

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,370
you also look at where are people using

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,840
Debian that's differentiated a lot too

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,910
it's not just we are the universal

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,710
operating system we say that a lot of

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,290
people are using Debian on servers and

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,120
if you are on laptops and basically

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,310
nobody is on a mobile phone except for a

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,020
few people who are lucky enough to still

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,780
have an open loco or something like that

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:07,660
right so you know we've really

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:09,670
differentiated that being a lot so

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,950
that's the large-scale structure thing I

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,070
think it's it's interesting to think

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,330
about it because you know it kind of

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,350
makes you think about how that means

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:30,790
evolving now this is where it really

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:32,710
gets strained red shift okay how do we

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,210
have red shift in Debian I don't see any

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,620
red when I look out and what's subbing

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,380
in the middle of a flame war or

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,390
something here's the kind of an amusing

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,330
paper which I don't think it's been

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,890
peer-reviewed yet but it says what if

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,810
the universe rather than actually

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,430
expanding right now like we think it is

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,830
because of red shift what if the massive

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,840
everything is increasing at once and it

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,220
says well we would everything would work

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,450
pretty much just like it does now we

00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,310
wouldn't even be able to test this

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,750
theory and well you know I don't know if

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,540
the universe of the mass of the universe

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,040
is increasing exponentially over time

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,950
like this paper says it is it seems a

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,530
little unlikely Debian's maths is

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,630
definitely has definitely increased we

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,490
have an enormous mass and an enormous

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,020
momentum we're moving in a certain

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,320
direction and it's really hard to move

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:24,240
Debian into a different direction now so

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,779
you know one really easy example of this

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,089
system be

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,029
you know think about how many threads

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,160
we've had about SystemVue lately and

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:35,560
yeah and this is just this isn't

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,240
replacing be packaged with apt and

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,740
breaking all of our dependencies and

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,810
having to change everything this is

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,970
changing health systems boot which you

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,620
do once a week or once a month or once a

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,350
year or whatever it's it's a minor

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,720
change as things go right and yet it's

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,059
it's an enormous controversy inside the

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,730
project so I think we have to think

00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:58,660
about you know this momentum this mass

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,629
and how do we manage it how can we make

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,540
Debian nimble on top of all this you

00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:07,059
know banana so I think that's probably

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,089
the largest problem that Debian is

00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,829
facing right now and will face in you

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:15,220
know the next however far out you want

00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:18,519
to look it's it's kind of hard to give a

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,800
talk about Debian cosmology because when

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,569
what is a long time period long time

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,939
scale in Debian we have 20 years of

00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:30,250
history to look back on can we you know

00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:31,990
can people think in their head Wow will

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,709
Demi be around in 20 years I don't know

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,689
you pick a time scale that you know that

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,430
seems to make sense to you for the rest

00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,990
of this talk I'm not gonna try to force

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,009
some kind of a time scale on you if you

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,079
want to think a hundred years ahead

00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:47,230
great if you want to think ten years

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:52,360
ahead okay you know but I'm gonna try to

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:54,009
think about moving forward but first I

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,930
have a little digression which I forgot

00:12:54,009 --> 00:13:02,709
about so one of the examples of a way

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:06,279
that the you know the momentum in Debian

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:08,470
can be a problem I mentioned apt well

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,730
there's this interesting thing being

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,550
developed right now called functional

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,160
package management it started out with

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,410
Nix OS and now the new projects gotten

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,600
involved with it with this new wiki

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,990
wicks I don't know how to say it

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,730
the idea is that it's somehow takes

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,649
ideas from functional programming and

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,300
applies them the package management so I

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,100
it's bread and butter for me I'm really

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,929
interested in it being a Haskell guy now

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,519
you know being in a functional program

00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:35,860
like wow there's some interesting ways

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,410
to use these ideas it's not really

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,990
functional but it's a neat terminology

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,740
to hook

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,930
and well this lets you do is it's kind

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,300
of a sore space system in a way I don't

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,160
know it has anybody used any of these

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,230
systems in the audience I'm just curious

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,300
you have Zach okay I'd love to chat with

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,870
you about it and get a broader idea but

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,580
you know the idea is kind of that you

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,070
never make a destructive change in the

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,230
system every package changes atomic and

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,760
if you have dependencies you might have

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,440
multiple versions of a package installed

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,810
at a time and it's completely different

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,390
than the D package model in every way

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,890
and you know it's kind of inconceivable

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,140
to think that debian would switch to

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,720
something like this model now it would

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,610
just be so incredibly hard you know the

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,620
switching the app would be just nothing

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,930
in comparison and it's art it's much

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,330
later in our evolution and we have a lot

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,830
more structure built up around our

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,970
current system than we did back then

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:34,100
even but you know this is an example of

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,870
something that you know the universe is

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,339
coming up with neat new things how do we

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,380
possibly put them in a debian we can

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,020
obviously package up these package

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,520
managers and make it easy enough for

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,110
people to use them as a third party

00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,459
thing you can install stuff in your home

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,649
directory with functional package

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:50,089
management and just you know have a

00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,510
system on top a devil you know that kind

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,520
of thing

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,320
but how do you mean how do you integrate

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,910
this kind of thing or ideas from this

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,130
kind of thing into Debian I think the

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,730
closest we're coming is the switch to

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,260
more declarative systems for Debian

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,790
packages so that rather than maintainer

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,589
scripts we have triggers and stuff like

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,899
that but this is just taking it to a

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:11,690
whole new level and you know there's a

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,540
lot to learn from stuff like this so

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,700
that's my kind of quick look at the

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,640
modern era of Debian let's move into the

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:22,940
futures that I was talking about so just

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,970
like in cosmology I think you all

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,320
probably know where this is going to go

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,820
you know one of the models for the

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,190
future is the Debian is in some way

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,420
going to continue to expand and grow for

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:37,130
however long you want to think ahead and

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,160
there's kind of two ways that I think

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,670
this can happen it could be a targeted

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,649
growth where we pick a direction we want

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,839
Debian to move in and we just put

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,250
everything behind that and we have

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,800
enough momentum going that we can

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,160
continue to maintain growth as time goes

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,730
on

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,040
and meet the needs of you know that one

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,660
area so we could pick say the server

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,520
market and say okay we're doing all this

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,810
Debian cloud stuff people talked about

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,970
all the talks that are going to be here

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,040
at Def Con about that you know if you

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,240
there's a lot of that going on we have

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,350
if you go up to any virtual VPS provider

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,850
you know you can pick a Debian image

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,920
pretty much on every single one of them

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,740
you know it's it's big in that area

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,960
obviously or we could say well we're

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,260
gonna try to you know also handle

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,370
desktop or mobile or something because

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,990
something a little bit more targeted it

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,510
might be a good idea than just something

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,570
that broad but you know maybe if we

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,030
decide well we just want to do this in

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,420
this then that would help us grow I

00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,280
don't know it's just one model if you

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,110
look at mobile though and you look at

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,990
where Debian is right now this is a

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,300
screenshot of Little Debbie which is a

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,040
Android app that it basically des

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,260
bootstraps Debian that's what it's doing

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,670
there in the screenshot and this is kind

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,920
of the current state of the art of

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,480
Debian on all the mobile devices that

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,890
every single person out there has in

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,800
their pocket I'm assuming that aren't

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,390
running Debian probably you know it's

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,390
pretty basic it really doesn't give you

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,069
a system that can do a lot of wonderful

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,569
things unless you're wanting to do

00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,370
wonderful things at the command line in

00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,449
a you know with a virtual keyboard which

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:15,350
isn't much fun you know what can we you

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,480
know you could think about what can we

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,030
do to expand this you know can we say

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,949
add Android support into Debian in some

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,260
ways you can install Android apps and

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,240
run them you know can we have some way

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,640
of getting a you know installing

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,170
something in a chroot of this type and

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,390
then displaying it on the normal Android

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,010
you know display and having a full

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,100
interactive application and that kind of

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,710
thing so that's kind of an example of

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,320
how we could go into one area and try to

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,590
expand you know get that being growing

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,750
in that area the other you know the

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,670
other major way that I think we could

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,890
grow Debian or the Debian could continue

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,220
growing is this more community driven

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:57,680
model this is kind of where you have

00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:00,080
different projects doing their own thing

00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,170
and Debian can somehow come in and help

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,580
them out and you know these are kind of

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,470
you know we have some good examples like

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,180
Freedom bog

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,060
but I smell the recited entails and

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,560
stuff like that that are you know using

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,330
Debian in great ways they're doing

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,070
wonderful stuff hopefully they're

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:20,180
getting a lot of developers I hope I

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,860
don't know if that's the case but you

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,750
know there are community driven things

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,160
there ways that Debian can expand out

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,540
into an area without having to move the

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,610
whole project there you can just say

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,430
it's a custom Debian distribution it's a

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,600
blend whatever and we're still you know

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,670
it's still contributing back it's a

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,830
wonderful you know you could system

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,560
going on there now if we look at

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,930
something like the Raspberry Pi I think

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,910
we kind of made a mistake with a

00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,750
Raspberry Pi because we said we're not

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,070
going to support the specific arm

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,400
instruction said that they want to use

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,800
because it's 5% faster or something and

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,620
so they went off and built raspbian and

00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,170
that's fine you know but we've kind of I

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,540
think possibly lost a little bit of the

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,220
mind chair in the Raspberry Pi community

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,840
because everybody is like well okay we

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,240
got this raspbian thing it's not Debian

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,630
right of course it is in pretty much

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,000
every important way and maybe if we had

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,260
been a little bit more open to this

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,480
project coming in and saying we would

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:20,150
like to build everything from arm arm d5

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,090
whatever it was you know maybe we would

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,730
have had a bit more opportunity for

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,320
growth and expansion there and then if

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,680
you look at just Debian developer

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,800
communities in general you know there's

00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,320
always opportunities which we sometimes

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,590
don't take advantage of to have really

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,380
good relationships with you know various

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,780
interesting projects that might end up

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,340
using Debian in some way or might end up

00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,510
contributing back or becoming part of it

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,340
even and so I think that you know I

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,750
really feel pretty bullish about this

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,990
community driven thing I think it's kind

00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,650
of how Debian has always worked I don't

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,270
know if you know it's it's hard to look

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,740
out and say oh in 10 years

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,870
Debian will be an attractive target for

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,190
people doing you know whatever the

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:11,540
equivalent of the raspberry pie is in

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,720
ten years but I hope so so that's the

00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,000
one model whoa

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,460
what happened the other model huh okay

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,900
so steady-state you know it's the it's

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,910
another cosmological model obviously I

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,040
think you know we could just continue

00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,170
sort of coasting along indefinitely

00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,760
without really saying oh we're gonna

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,810
make big changes we're gonna do this

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,180
we're gonna do that we could just keep

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,850
doing our thing and be completely happy

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,230
for you know as long as you want to look

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,760
out we've got a lot of momentum we can

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,290
keep going even if we all stop doing

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,390
much today I think that we would keep

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:47,130
going forty years and years quite

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:49,600
happily and you know after a while you

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,470
start having to think about generational

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,410
things you know I think when most of our

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,600
generation generations got involved with

00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,980
Debian we kind of had some

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,990
infrastructure that we just kind of

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,300
thought was there maybe it was a kernel

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,740
or a C compiler or something like that

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,690
we didn't really think about it maybe we

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,220
occasionally ran into a bug unit and we

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,010
reported the bug but it wasn't something

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,680
that was you know at the forefront of

00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,240
our minds of something new and exciting

00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,860
necessarily and maybe that's where

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,510
Debian is going maybe Debian becomes the

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,540
infrastructure that things get built on

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,010
top of over time and you know didn't

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,890
there's enough people to keep it going

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,690
because you know if nothing else people

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,890
like companies like Google as long as

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,900
think you think you're using Debian are

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:38,620
gonna want to employ tons the Debian

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:41,260
developers just to keep it going so you

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,930
know this is definitely I think a likely

00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,520
possible future at some point is that

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:49,030
Debian becomes the infrastructure and

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,860
that's fine and you know if you continue

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,330
looking forward does it continue being

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,280
infrastructure at some point as a git

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,480
replace or does it even matter if it

00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,190
gets replaced in X years I don't know

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:04,960
but you know I think this is another

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,670
likely possibility I will see and then

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,520
of course we have this final fun

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,930
possibility that you get and I might I

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,420
would probably put some bullet points up

00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,220
here but I've I had an unexpected root

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:19,300
canal and stuff so I kind of rattle

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,430
slides at this point but I you know you

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,800
can't have a big crunch and this is

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,510
always my favorite possibility for the

00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,900
universe as a whole I don't know about

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,340
for Debian

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,870
you know what would happen if debian

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,460
just petered out and somehow died and

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,960
fall off a cliff and everything started

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,790
going down and everybody switched to

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,920
Android on their servers or who knows

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,600
what I mean what are they gonna replace

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,770
us with I can't possibly think that

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,380
maybe there's got to be something out

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:49,990
there right maybe it's all Fedora in the

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:51,430
future I don't know - where folks you

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,050
know this is definitely a possibility

00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,540
that we have to keep in mind and it's

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,950
not like the end of the world right it's

00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,410
only the end it would only be the end of

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,150
Debian and even if that happened think

00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,090
back to that earlier slide about apt

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,590
establishing a new paradigm in package

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:10,390
management you know even if debian

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,340
stopped being actively used and

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,100
developed at some future point that I

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,990
don't want to imagine it would still

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,640
have influence things in a great many

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,230
ways and I think we could all be quite

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,500
pleased with the work that we had done

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,480
on it of course we all hope that it open

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,070
to be used for as long as we're involved

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,540
in the project or maybe 10 years longer

00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,740
so we can keep using Debian systems

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:35,260
after we retire so I kind of thought

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,630
that I would you know take a little poll

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,460
the audience who's who thinks that were

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,160
gonna somehow continue to expand for

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,180
however long you want to imagine as a

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:49,060
long time hands continued expansion I

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:53,890
would say maybe 10% of the room ok so

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:58,430
who's for steady-state slightly fewer

00:23:53,890 --> 00:24:03,370
than for expansion okay big crunchers

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:03,370
[Laughter]

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,960
okay well I think we're for expansion

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:22,110
what was that so um so that's really all

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,150
that I came here to say it's a fairly

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,720
fluff talk I know I hope that you've

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,809
enjoyed it

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,620
maybe some people have some other

00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:38,300
cosmological models so they'd like to

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:38,300
fight to suggest yeah

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:46,800
Andrew cater a sort of relevant to the

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:49,530
Big Crunch scenario Andrew as I am a

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,390
cater on IRC s I'm watching other

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,320
community distributions fragment and

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:58,559
lose focus Fedora open SUSE SUSE it are

00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,429
killing themselves right now are we

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,800
doing the same mmm I don't think that

00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:07,500
we're fragmenting as such we've already

00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,090
kind of fragmented already there was a

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,470
whole boon to thing which I think it's

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:16,980
the first time I've said that word in

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:18,809
this talk you know and we I don't know

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,429
if we lose focus as such we've never

00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,260
really had focus have we've all just

00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:24,380
done or anything that's happened you

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,380
know

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,370
I was just saying to somebody over here

00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,760
that that one of the differences is that

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:37,920
those districts are actually more

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,440
tightly tied to something else that

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,360
matters whether it's the commercial

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,580
distribution organization that they were

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,230
sort of spawned out of or whatever that

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,660
they've had a a less completely

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,549
community-driven reason to exist and to

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,290
continue to exist than Debian has I

00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,510
would not be surprised if we don't end

00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,880
up having an entirely different life

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,850
cycle than something like Fedora

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,760
openSUSE the question I was going to

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,919
pose I've noticed as you have and you

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,500
made a couple of sort of references to

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,559
this that the average length of thread

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,929
about almost anything has gotten a lot

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,790
larger one of the things that I observed

00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,040
a while back though is that the average

00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,260
number of participants per thread had

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,030
not actually increased all that much it

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,070
was certainly for any given thread a

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,260
much smaller percentage of the people

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,150
currently active in the project then

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,830
used to be the case when there were 30

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,429
of us and five of us were screaming at

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:37,290
each other so I'm wondering if there's I

00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,850
don't know exactly what to take from

00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,309
that but the notion that you know a

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,990
similar number of people can just scream

00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,600
at each other for a whole lot longer and

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,429
still not come to a conclusion I don't

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,590
know if there's anything to take from

00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:51,030
that or learn from it or not yeah I mean

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,850
I don't know I was gonna I'd actually

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:57,270
meant to say that I was going to put the

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:59,669
systemd thread on here but despite this

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,230
being pretty a pretty zoomy thing there

00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:02,940
are resolution there are limits to

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,290
floating point resolution and eventually

00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,440
you can't actually represent the whole

00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:11,730
thread on in iceweasel or whatever I'm

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:16,200
running here yeah I may be what's

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:19,440
happened is that we have either a we

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,030
just have more people and so the number

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,590
of people who feel really strongly about

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,200
something they feel much more strongly

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,780
about it you have a small subset who all

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,640
feel that they have to win and so they

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,980
just keep talking about this and they

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,020
don't come to a consensus do you have a

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,600
thought yeah it's it's really

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,000
interesting because as a project I think

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,800
we have

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,140
since about ourselves that we're all

00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,750
about freedom and so forth and somewhere

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,300
along the way freedom got translated

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:51,390
into we should all be able to have our

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,880
own way and that is that was really not

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,090
part of the freedom that we cared about

00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,760
when this project was young even when

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,820
there were strong debates they were

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,220
debates about you know technical details

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,660
or you know when the Constitution was

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,120
being drafted there were there were a

00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,460
few sort of big questions about how

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,260
should this be structured and then you

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,430
know a draft got generated a lot of

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,300
folks looked at it went yeah that's

00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:20,190
close enough and off we ran and the the

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,070
amount of bike shedding that goes on

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,380
these days just scares me a little bit

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,390
because it seems like taking that word

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,810
freedom and translating it way too much

00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:33,210
into not needing to collaborate or not

00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,400
needing to come to agreement and

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,850
consensus I don't know how we change

00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,920
that or fix it but it bothers me

00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,870
sometimes when I see people take the

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,990
things that I thought of when I first

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,700
joined the project in 1994 as being

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,500
fundamental tenets of the project and

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,050
they use the same words but they mean

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,840
something very different and it causes

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,870
their behaviors to be very different

00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,610
from what I would like to see yeah you

00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,410
know when I when the Constitution was

00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,300
originally proposed I was kind of

00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,190
against it and I thought well this seems

00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,380
like a lot of faff around for something

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,720
that shouldn't matter and I didn't even

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,790
bother to vote on it and you know

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,950
because I was like well if Ian wants to

00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,480
do this great you could do this you know

00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,000
he'll take care of it if it breaks he'll

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,850
fix it and you know I think we've kind

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,550
of there's maybe it's just that we have

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,870
a lot of people now who Debian is an

00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:27,630
important part of their life maybe

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,550
professionally or you know personally

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,620
much more important how many people here

00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:35,790
in the room have their livelihood in

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,110
some way connected to Debian so probably

00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,460
about as many people as one Debian

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,460
continue growing which

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,920
yeah one thing I just wanted to add to

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,530
what Buddha was saying about the bike

00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,240
shedding and stuff in prepare in

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,690
preparation for my buff later this week

00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,250
about the conduct I've actually been

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,010
reading a lot of other codes codes of

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:02,790
conduct on a page prepared by SAC thanks

00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:04,260
for that and one item that I saw coming

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,020
back a few times in which I've also

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,120
taken into my proposed code of conduct

00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:13,560
that we'll be discussing is about be

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,200
collaborative try to work with all

00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,000
people and I think that's that's it

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,730
could help to put something like that

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,260
there but it's just a propose anyway we

00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:30,540
still have to discuss as a dark a

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,130
destructive person and focus on the on

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,220
the Big Crunch model for a room for a

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:38,490
moment the question is um what would

00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,910
what would happen what would we be able

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:45,150
to to do in that beam if we would be in

00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:48,870
this big crunch situation right because

00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:50,730
okay now we are big wheel we are very

00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:54,150
important and we are central to the

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:59,030
quite central to the free software world

00:30:54,150 --> 00:31:02,630
in a number of ways so what happens if

00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:06,650
this world in some ways this integrates

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:12,650
we obviously there must be a replacement

00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:17,520
so we should be open to change and

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:22,500
revolve in a in a way that makes the

00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:26,490
world go on even if we in in the way we

00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,500
are now fundamentally change you know I

00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,940
haven't I didn't really think about the

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,530
Big Crunch is affecting the free

00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,780
software community as a whole I kind of

00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,370
just assumed that that was some

00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:38,640
background noise that kept everything

00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,680
going even if debian went away I mean

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,880
yeah it seems to me that debian could

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,980
definitely go away without the free

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,230
software community fragmentary imploding

00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,170
or you know whatever turning the BSD

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,730
licenses and you know managing down the

00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,039
Apple rabbit hole or what

00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:55,529
that's what not that's not what what

00:31:53,039 --> 00:32:00,360
what I was about here right it's it's

00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:05,039
more we have one model of working in in

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,740
our free software ecosystem that maybe

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,690
this model in some at some point in time

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,909
is not relevant anymore it's like you

00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:18,240
maybe some of you know this gunk arts

00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:21,659
model of evolving system there is a

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,070
first system which is a big hack this is

00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,799
the second system is built by a

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,919
community and great and does everything

00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,350
but at some point in time this this

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,000
second system becomes irrelevant

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:36,450
fundamental ideas will be changed and

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,460
the third system will or third systems

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:44,159
will evolve on really both on the on the

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,860
remains of the second system that's just

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,220
what happening now slowly with X for

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:52,860
example X will not be completely

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,220
disintegrate it is integrating but

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,620
people will evolve on it and I think the

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,620
same we should we should have some

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:07,380
thoughts about the same ideas in in

00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:11,220
Debian and we should prepare what might

00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,049
happen if if this case starts growing on

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,490
us

00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:15,960
yeah thank you for that I I definitely

00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,529
think you're thinking farther ahead than

00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,490
I am and that's great

00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:24,330
anybody else with the question I'm not

00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:27,270
sure how we are on time here and I think

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:31,470
this integrating is not really an

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:35,490
interesting point Debian is I think they

00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:38,159
are to each our scratch if we don't have

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:42,299
to scratch left there's no reason to it

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:45,210
as long as as we are community turn as

00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:48,049
long as that will be in scratch we will

00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,049
continue to itch

00:33:50,160 --> 00:34:00,150
to the mailing list problem I think I

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:04,380
see a tendency on mailing lists that we

00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:07,190
have something like this anti-politician

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:14,060
and anti Internet

00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:16,230
intellect point it's too often

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,650
everything that's on a mailing list

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:23,730
that's bike shedding if you give them

00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:26,160
point against something then if it's not

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,410
the opinion that you are then it's bike

00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:33,450
shedding it's not a technical argument

00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:37,380
you are against progress and I think we

00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:40,500
need to be a bit more collaborative at

00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:43,580
this point to more listen to each other

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,960
and not to dismiss everything as

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,860
everything you don't understand

00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:54,300
doesn't make sense it's only people that

00:34:49,860 --> 00:35:00,840
want their own stuff keeping their it's

00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:02,670
I think the reason some flames go up

00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,580
very much is that it's important to

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,550
people and then it's important to listen

00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,930
to them and not just tell them oh oh

00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:15,810
it's heart

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:18,870
we don't care I I think if you go back

00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:21,450
and look at older threads in Debian like

00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:23,220
I did for this talk or if you go you

00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,840
know wherever stuff's getting done and

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,520
you look at what a thread looks like

00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,560
when stuff is getting done and people

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,970
were busy making things happen versus

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,710
when people were busy complaining about

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,600
other people making things happen or

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,620
whatever there's a really different tone

00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,450
there and I think you can learn to

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,390
recognize that tone I don't know if you

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,650
can teach people who are caught over

00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,900
part of the problem which we all

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,990
probably are from time to time to

00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,210
squelch that down or not but I think

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:51,260
it's something we need to be reckoning

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,260
Enrico Oh

00:35:53,080 --> 00:36:00,720
and electric no it's right there there's

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,720
a spans go up to the stand

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:19,180
Oh on that point it's it's interesting

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:21,310
to make that point I found myself after

00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,070
some frustrating discussion I was having

00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:26,080
asking people to please real-life

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,250
discussion about something completely

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,150
different

00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:34,390
asking people telling people please can

00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:37,360
you please stick to I'm more interested

00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:39,400
in hearing your personal story I'm more

00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,700
interesting in hearing your experience

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:46,060
in what you have done please don't I'm

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,690
less interested in hearing what you wish

00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:52,870
would would happen unless interesting in

00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:55,090
hearing what you wish I will do please

00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:58,360
let me choose what I will do and I'm

00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:02,740
happy to hear your experience and I

00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:05,410
think that is a fathom that also matches

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,330
very well what you mentioned when people

00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,940
are getting things done they're not

00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:13,360
discussing about the way they wish

00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,980
everybody else would believe or the way

00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,220
they wish everybody else would have done

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,410
something but they bring in their

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,290
experience when I did this last time I

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:26,380
did it this way and it didn't work let's

00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,030
try another way but then as when it

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,850
comes from personal experience it is

00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:37,390
more about getting things done then

00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:41,470
about seeing who has the better ideas of

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:44,500
something which is rather pointless so

00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:46,210
yeah I wish in meaningless to see people

00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,600
bringing in their experience their

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,660
stories at work the way they fix the

00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,020
problem like that before and how rather

00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:58,300
than people should do this people should

00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,920
do this is possibly something I don't

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,760
want to see an amazing list anymore

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,760
yeah

00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:11,970
you know I think we have to somehow

00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,020
learn to be more accepting of just doing

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,900
something and if it's a mistake

00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,580
reverting it you know we it would be

00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,190
great if we had more technology around

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,510
this but just socially deciding you know

00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,960
if somebody wants to go off and do

00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,730
something then let them and if it turns

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,770
out to be a bad idea we can undo it

00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,930
later and trying to have I think you

00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:33,690
know if you look at where we're really

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,850
good in Debian and making things happen

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,100
it is stuff like the one maintainer for

00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,810
package model where people are given the

00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,600
power to go off and do something and

00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:44,220
they're it's their responsibility and if

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,780
you have a flame we're about it well we

00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,359
have processes but we don't use them

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,670
very often and it would be great if we

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,619
could find more ways to expand that kind

00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,270
of that way of doing things often the

00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,970
things that don't just touch one package

00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,859
you know I think that's kind of what's

00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,590
broken down is at which we're building

00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:03,090
this bigger stuff on top of individual

00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,760
packages and we don't really have a way

00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,410
to go off and say the sky is gonna

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,970
handle the systemd transition with this

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,350
group of people he's got together or

00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,820
something maybe that doesn't work you

00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,970
know looks unhappy with it so if it's a

00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,310
bad idea but you know there seems there

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:21,780
must be a way to make it happen anybody

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:23,280
else yeah yeah I I used to expect that

00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,560
at some point sooner or later

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,359
debian would effectively just split into

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,190
multiple groups which competed with each

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,840
other I mean I know some people talk

00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,880
about a bun too as a fork of debian but

00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,080
it's kind of a different thing I really

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,720
thought that maybe sometime there just

00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,580
be a discussion where the two sides just

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,720
disagreed so badly about some issue that

00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,520
you would end up with two things

00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,130
basically both of which claimed to be

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,119
the true Debbie and whichever obviously

00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,460
one probably would own the trademark

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,290
bird yeah I mean both of them would just

00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,580
think they were the true continuation

00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:53,070
and hate each other forever

00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,650
that seems to have become less likely

00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:58,020
now and it seems to me that most of the

00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:00,869
times we have big discussions it just

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,670
ends up with not much happening rather

00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:04,590
than something happening that really

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,240
annoys people I mean in some ways though

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,130
it's better in some ways that's worse no

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,260
that's a fascinating comment maybe

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,960
you've I mean that's so bad that doesn't

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,050
fit in any of my

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,030
three models the forking off thing and

00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:19,030
it is versus obviously if it's in the

00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,760
cosmological model and so yeah that's

00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,619
fascinating how I mean why is that less

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,900
likely now than it used to be is there

00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:27,790
less excitement and energy around Debian

00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,890
or is it something else I yeah I mean

00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,380
and now I would worry more that again if

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:34,780
things get is get harder to push new

00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,609
ideas and you end up it's not like well

00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,250
we are still getting new people but

00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:41,080
we're if you look at the official

00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:47,440
members of Debian we're basically only

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:48,910
at a replacement rate and I don't know I

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,380
have to say looking around the room in

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,020
particular here but we're definitely a

00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,000
kind of aging population - yeah

00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,880
so although that's that guess is still

00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,980
fine for a few decades but yeah if we

00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,410
want to continue in the kind of long

00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,200
term of Debian having a good future and

00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,330
still being relevant then we again on

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,000
your graph we need to how do we get back

00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,470
into a into really growing not just

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,530
growing around the community around the

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:17,589
edges kind of helpers and contributors

00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,270
and so on but actually there are people

00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:24,400
who are members of Debian should also be

00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:27,640
growing and taking new ideas yeah sort

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,240
of replying to that if we go a bit

00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,920
smaller than cosmology Kuzma logical and

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:38,109
go to the Galactic saying I think

00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,770
Debian could be looked at as if it

00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:45,700
started out being a star nursery and

00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:47,950
then we turned into galaxies and we're

00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:51,450
now at a stage where we need to find a

00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,450
way of maintaining the black hole

00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:56,169
if people aren't allowed to work on an

00:41:54,069 --> 00:42:06,459
alternative black hole then the arms

00:41:56,169 --> 00:42:08,699
will fly off as we suck more yeah so so

00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:11,229
the black hole is the sort of boring

00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:12,849
central packages which you're not

00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:15,669
allowed to touch because if you do that

00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:18,069
everything will break and we need a way

00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:19,959
of instantiating a new galaxy next door

00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:21,369
and just replacing the back hole and as

00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:24,969
you say if it doesn't work you can go

00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:26,559
revert so and the other thing is that if

00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:28,059
you look at the mailing lists you get

00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,519
the impression that there's a war going

00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:33,789
on where there is going to be a schism

00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:35,109
and half the people will go off and

00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:38,019
maintain their servers and the other

00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:40,239
half will go off with their tablets or

00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:42,219
whatever and sort them out but actually

00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:43,359
the people in those discussions aren't

00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:45,459
gonna build Eve there are those things

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:48,219
and the rest of Debian is just getting

00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:49,959
on with it so that's why I think Debian

00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:51,130
doesn't fragment is because the vocal

00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:54,149
people aren't necessarily the people

00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:57,399
doing the job I think there's another

00:42:54,149 --> 00:42:59,339
possibility and that is that when I

00:42:57,399 --> 00:43:02,169
think about Murray's questions there are

00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:04,089
there are more derivatives of Debian

00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:05,649
than any other core distribution so

00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:07,659
there are certainly lots of people out

00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:09,459
there who have decided that the thing

00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:11,139
they wanted to do differently or that

00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:14,319
they cared about was worth going and

00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:16,749
creating a CDD or a fork or whatever so

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,019
that's happened it just hasn't dragged

00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:21,999
the trademark into or the name into some

00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:24,429
kind of a pit which I would hate to see

00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:26,949
happen but I have the sense that maybe

00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:29,169
the other thing about it is that Debian

00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:31,299
has become large enough and means enough

00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:33,249
things to enough people that you know

00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:34,539
the vast majority of us in the project

00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:37,269
who don't give a flying you-know-what

00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:39,149
about whether it's upstart or systemd

00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:41,829
you know that that's an impassioned

00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:44,529
important discussion for the people for

00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:46,989
whom how the system boots is the thing

00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:49,179
they care about in Debian but for the

00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:51,159
vast majority of us it's like as you say

00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:54,999
you know I do that once per kernel

00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:57,980
update cycle a reboot and the rest of

00:43:54,999 --> 00:44:00,620
the time I just don't care and so

00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,140
the idea that you know the distribution

00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,540
would fracture somehow Debian wouldn't

00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,580
be Debian anymore because there's a

00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,010
fractious discussion going on in a

00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,630
particular sub project or sub part of

00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,550
the distribution it's just hard for me

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,420
to wrap my brain around yeah it kind of

00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,240
seems like it'd have to be something

00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,620
that is a technological base some kind

00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,240
of you know we want to change the social

00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,680
contract or maybe you want to change

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:31,970
what free software is and that would

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:34,430
fracture Debian but yeah so on the lines

00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:37,190
of what be Dale just said this this way

00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:41,060
that we are becoming almost preferred

00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:45,350
choice to be upstream it's a very big

00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:47,000
thing and enables our work to scale much

00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,730
better than if we try to grow the

00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,870
project I think the reason why we aren't

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,750
growing in terms of number of people is

00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:55,760
because we're already some kind of

00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,170
limits of scaling we're having you know

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,060
a lot of the things we're talking about

00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,440
difficulties to do with coordinating

00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:04,130
communicating between this number of

00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:06,680
people and allowing and becoming

00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:08,930
upstream for people as a way for us to

00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,970
scale that a lot better and one of the

00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:13,850
things that we should be trying to do is

00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:15,980
to look outward rather than inward and

00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,600
to try to think of ways in which we can

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,760
be a better upstream for people to make

00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,050
it easier for people to derive so that

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,900
fewer people have to do their work

00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:27,010
within Debian and that they're easier to

00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,390
do it outside Debian because after all

00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,310
software freedom is about freedom to

00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,050
make the change yourself to the software

00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,490
you were using and that doesn't

00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,890
necessarily mean that you want to have a

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:39,110
huge kind of get involved with a huge

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,670
complicated upstream who are processes

00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:42,530
and decide to do things particular way

00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,150
no you should just be able to do it the

00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,730
moment if you actually want to do that

00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:51,590
it's quite hard and we should make it

00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:56,600
easier yeah you know when you think

00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:59,120
about that maybe I mean it's kind of

00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:02,600
what's happening now but you have to

00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:05,150
wonder if I mean your scenario you can

00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,340
go one of either two ways you can have a

00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,530
lot of custom Debbi distributions and

00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,099
things based on Debian and Debian can

00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,539
just become

00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:13,789
background infrastructure and then who

00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:15,739
wants to work on it when it's something

00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:17,599
that's down there in the depths the

00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:19,519
other thing other exciting things are

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,869
being built on top of you know maybe you

00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,599
contribute patches back when it makes

00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:25,910
your life easier but do we get you know

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,569
do we get a sustaining model that way or

00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:31,609
you know maybe we don't I kind of used

00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:33,410
to have this argument with Manoj I

00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:35,329
thought that Debian had to expand or we

00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,729
were just gonna die and Manish was like

00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:39,380
no Debian is just about what I need for

00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:41,630
my system and what my friends need for

00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,119
their systems I don't need you know I'm

00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,489
only interested in it for that in that

00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,279
way and I don't know maybe Manos was

00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:55,130
right you know I think that I was

00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:58,660
definitely wrong well yeah the best

00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,660
arguments are always that way all right

00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:06,079
okay is time is over so we have to take

00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:10,089
this as the closing comment and yeah you

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,089
have to move it to lunch to discuss over

00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:19,819
