and with another cloud so this time on

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:13,620
the official Debian image status take it

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:17,490
away Jimmy hello so so official Debian

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:22,109
image status is sort of interesting

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,640
concept so far Debian has you know

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,670
Debian is the universal operating system

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,720
we have it on our website and our slide

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:35,430
banners right next to the screen we've

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:39,300
historically shipped images for CDs for

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,079
USB for live images etc embedded devices

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,000
but we haven't chips until recently

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,160
images for public cloud kind of

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,860
environment and I say public cloud

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,340
because when you're doing private cloud

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,239
it's for use internally and the

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,500
technologies are often the same but

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,559
customizations for internal use are

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,949
common and they're really separate from

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,030
the notion of what's official Debian

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:09,600
from Devon's perspective as a project

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,970
because when you do something as Debian

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,760
when you offer something as official

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,500
Debian and offer it to a third party

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,170
that's when it's actually relevant to

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,700
what you're calling it so that's why the

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,619
public cloud environment is relevant

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,979
it's a very unusual environment there is

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:30,060
a weird background thing below the cloud

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,790
and it has to integrate well look on

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,030
nussbaum the that being project leader

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,640
said in a discussion in April on on the

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,130
Debian cloud list now official Debian

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,740
image I don't think that for public

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,960
clouds he referred to a different cloud

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,420
official has been explicitly defined and

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,909
it's true we should define it it's a bug

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,860
you know this is something we should

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,259
have an answer to so that's what I'm

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,740
trying to figure out as a conversation

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,770
to start with you all so what does

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,369
official mean okay it's an adjective

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,950
great but what does Debian need here

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,009
from the notion of an official Debian

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,950
image or or from the reality and what do

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,470
the public clouds need here on on the

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,290
on the vendor side for example whether

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,849
that's a large company like Amazon or

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,720
Google or whether it's a small one like

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,430
GPL host for example you know the needs

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,650
are more similar than you think but

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,480
they're not the same you know so we

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,610
should discuss the differences and

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,590
similarities and sort of bridge the gap

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,819
is what I mean I'm just trying to turn

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,069
it I'm going to try to go through the

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:41,459
slides quickly but not too quickly so

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:44,730
that you can follow my voice but then we

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,110
should discuss its above so we also need

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,890
to figure out how debian works with the

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,360
cloud vendors and it's a reciprocal

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,030
collaborative relationship and then we

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,420
have a lot of time to talk and hopefully

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,310
we'll come up with some criteria but

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,720
it's a it's one 45 minute session so

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,120
really we'll just make some progress

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,170
toward it or start the conversation so

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,299
one of the things that makes Debian

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,750
Debian is of course our social contract

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:14,519
and anything that is officially Debian

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,290
should respect our social contract

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,989
comply with the free software guidelines

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,359
and focus on users needs those are the

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,870
two core principles of Debian we should

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,280
stick with that anyone who uses

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,470
something that's officially Debian

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,170
should be able to rely on their trust of

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,549
Debian to trust the image they should be

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,170
able to anchor their trust in Debian

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,320
this extends to packages and

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,989
repositories to image builds and how to

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,459
discover the images at least one way of

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,650
discovering the images they should be

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,299
able to find them through Debian you

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,340
know they should get security fixes

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,810
updates from Debian you know they should

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,200
be able to rely on that beam as a source

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,670
and again things that are officially

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,730
that being are done within the Debian

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,799
community the build tools are just on

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,310
typing cloud you know there's deputy

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,420
Legolas IRC and where the code should

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,430
live is a little bit more complicated

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,109
some things are happening on github

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,880
these days some things are debian net

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,609
which is sort of official some things

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,560
are happening you know in various

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:17,030
different contexts but we should pay

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,030
attention to these issues in any case

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,280
Debbie needs to be able to support the

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,050
images users have issues they come to

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,760
Debian via whatever mechanism they want

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,780
to contact us we need to be able to help

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,270
them

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,169
and Quality Assurance and testing are

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,849
especially noteworthy because we don't

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,479
have a good solution for this now in

00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:41,220
cloud images for a typical desktop or

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,069
server installed we test this a lot in

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,130
our normal release engineering framework

00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:49,289
and we test upgrades we test packages we

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,720
test the whole system but for the cloud

00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,550
images there's no really good way to

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,120
test that we have yet and we need to

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,669
solve it right now we just do a couple

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,380
of manual tests and you know for the

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,680
Google images we have some incomplete

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,389
but useful internal tests to run etc but

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,389
Debian should have an answer to this it

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:13,319
would be a good thing so everything I

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,669
just said applies equally from the

00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,259
perspective of the cloud vendors they

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,599
need to pay attention to licensing and

00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,009
in their case legality more more than

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:23,220
specifically freedom but it needs to

00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,780
meet all their needs and users come to

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,669
them with concerns especially paying

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,750
customers but really every every source

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:33,150
feedback users often trust Google or

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,150
Amazon or whoever's providing to them

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,849
GPL and and they need to be able to rely

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:43,280
on that trust to trust an OS that they

00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:46,740
are being provided the vendors and the

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,659
operating system folks have their ways

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,449
of development and they need to work

00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:53,759
well together or use one set of tools to

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:56,849
develop solo or however the relationship

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,710
is going to work in that case and they

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:01,740
also need to support they offer support

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,330
contracts people use their forums they

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,539
need to make sure that their reputation

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:10,289
will be upheld by the quality of the

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:13,110
product etc but their what but wait

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:16,830
there's more there's other requirements

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,449
in the cloud context so some of the

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:28,979
unique concerns a lot of them revolve

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:30,840
around a motorcycle but others revolve

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,360
around the fact it clouds release faster

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,159
than the two-year really cycle of a you

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,949
know slow moving conservative

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:40,229
Enterprises drove like Debian they you

00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,870
know they they they need some

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:46,529
speed to handle things like performance

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,569
and security fixes so I have some

00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:52,259
examples here but the general category

00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:53,759
is you know customers internal or

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,279
external paying customers notice a

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,650
problem and they you know complain to

00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,110
the vendor the the team whatever the

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,400
right category is and getting an

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,900
upstream fixed is something to work on

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,819
and it takes time but sometimes

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,300
something needs to be done quickly to

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,650
satisfy business needs so some we had

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:16,349
some examples of we have experience at

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:18,210
Google when we switched to Debian as a

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:22,379
default from a previous default

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,939
distribution we there was a performance

00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,189
regression in networking for about 20

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,860
percent that's this is significant

00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,419
regression and the kernel was the same

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,620
right now we're not using the Debian

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,060
kernel that's a temporary thing we're

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,060
going to fix that but

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,000
you

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,039
here

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,039
[Music]

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,199
[Music]

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:44,469
[Music]

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:54,780
[Music]

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:18,909
but not in my we discuss

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,909
[Music]

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:36,690
[Music]

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:54,799
[Music]

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:09,999
[Music]

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:41,169
[Music]

00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:49,339
anyway that makes everyone happy I would

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,249
like to see not only the things that are

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,410
in the image to be in Debian main I

00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:56,870
would like also to be to have all the

00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:02,990
tools to create image to be in Debian

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:06,860
main agree therefore I'm not the idea to

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,670
use a certain cloud provider and you got

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:15,620
old to use that cloud provider to create

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:18,620
the image I don't like it I think I

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,569
would prefer that we use only tools that

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,420
are on main and as we can build the

00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:25,670
image only in Debian and not using a

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,929
cloud provider to do it so you you could

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,929
tools is in vain actually

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:40,780
I don't mean however obviously one of

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,480
the problems we've got is the version of

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:48,700
Yuka tools that we have in rain is from

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,080
what you identify ten or eleven and the

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,610
rate of innovation that's going on with

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,830
with all of the cloud providers is that

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,930
sometimes the API calls that you could

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,630
was doing from 2011 which is in stable

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,310
now it's just too out of date I

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,260
previously had a mention of a life cycle

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,650
emissions you across all the clouds yes

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,750
the question also could be why do you

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,730
use you can tools oh you don't need to

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,920
do that you can just create your image

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,580
initiate routes and it just works that's

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,500
what I did well my thing that the script

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,330
the Google compute engine images don't

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,170
actually use yuka tools but which I

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,020
guess makes sense because it's a

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,390
different infrastructure but the the

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,870
basic problem of fast changing API is

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,870
and

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,510
the ways of interacting with the cloud

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,940
and the feature sets and customer

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,370
expectations they all change faster than

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,240
it to your lifecycle so it's why

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,300
interacting with the cloud when you

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:50,120
build your image at all I don't know why

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,120
would you interact interact with

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,330
as they began to allow you to upload

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,560
that's a different problem because you

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:07,140
let them respond yeah yes so you can

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,550
build it outside of the cloud and maybe

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,180
you I don't know if you can really

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,180
validate it

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,930
you

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,460
liddie some of the clan with any cloud

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,350
you need to validate it before you

00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,960
publish it so either way the workflow of

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,960
debian needs to interact with the cloud

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,890
good validating and building the images

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,310
two different processes may be separated

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,680
right

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,709
but even then past that there-there the

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,079
contents of the image customers really

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,550
expect that to not work with the version

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,070
of the product that existed two or three

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,250
years ago or a year ago but my version

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,649
the product that exists now so all the

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:09,769
the tool I assume Amazon sticks tools

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:13,100
into the you don't stick tools in the

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:15,290
images but Google's we want to customers

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,390
to integrate so when they bring up the

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,430
the Debian operating system they can

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,470
interact with all the other products

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,430
inside of Google and one of the simple

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,200
things you might want to interact with

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,140
the cloud environment with these hey

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,930
I've got three extra volumes mounted I

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,000
want to snapshot them so that's that's

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,490
an API call actually just make one

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,959
obviously within your block device if

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,290
you've got something like LVM or you

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:43,060
could do does it has something to do is

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,060
building an official Debian cloud image

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,990
discussion is also overlapping very much

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,899
with the packaging Bob tomorrow morning

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,699
so I think we should have this

00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:55,279
discussion but it's this we should

00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:57,640
probably save it for part of tomorrow

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,640
morning

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,689
aspects of of what my slide and the

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,939
general concepts need to discuss yeah so

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,709
one comment about the versions in Maine

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:13,250
of the tools that you are using to build

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:16,189
images it's not like the official other

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,949
Debian thingy we have like the proper CD

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:22,130
release I made using software which is

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,929
entirely even packaged in there kyv so I

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,420
think it's great to set high standards

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:28,910
but I don't think that before being able

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,620
to call something official we need to to

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,660
be able to build it only with stuff

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,300
which is in the current main which would

00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:38,420
mean essentially being always one

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,100
release behind in the bill dependencies

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,140
of the image we expect to the content of

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,170
it might be reasonable to allow stuff

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:49,809
from unstable because we even do the eye

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,809
with versions you know yeah

00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,690
you

00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:18,590
that even if there is an absolutely

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,239
unsurmountable problem we will not have

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,340
official images that cannot be built

00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:25,110
entirely using free software which means

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,530
not using Amazonian

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:31,200
yeah I'm not means it means not the gym

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,630
it means that you have to have a way to

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,300
build the image without using those and

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,910
by the way neither of our images

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,160
neither Amazon requires you to use the

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,840
proprietary cloud to build the image you

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,220
can build an Amazon image and eucalyptus

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,050
you can build a Google compute engine

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:51,240
image on your workstation it works so I

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,610
think about two different issues does it

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,420
mixed in the description yes thank you

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:59,640
one is oh do we build I think that for

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,190
that we need to be as close as possible

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,830
to usual Debian practices

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,830
yes and ideally that means adding new

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,460
tools is package in Debian unstable for

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:14,730
now is fine on iOS and not on github for

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,770
example that is easy for existing

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,080
biddies to join the team etc well

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,240
everything do it as we do in Debian

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,820
usually then has the question of the

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,370
content of those images and if it's an

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,440
official Debian image I think that it

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,980
needs to be as close as possible as

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,070
realistically possible to what we ship

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,990
on CD what you get when you install

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:41,090
Debian is in your CD or something else

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,620
and I understand your point about

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,510
customers wanting different kernel

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,200
versions of whatever but if it's not

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,730
what we ship in Debian then well we have

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,670
to stick with what you in the yellow

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,400
fish or Debian image sure if you have

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,470
more than two or three packages that

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,450
differ from our standard Debian

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,090
installation or that if you have

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,820
complications difference issue then it's

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,160
not official Debian however at the same

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,910
time what we ship in Debian is already

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,070
dead like what we ship on an arm machine

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,750
is different than what we ship on an x86

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,390
machine including the boot loader for

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,190
example there are support tools that

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,710
might be included on a default s/390

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,010
installation that are different and so

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,860
while I think it should be officially

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,050
Debian in some way it's not obvious that

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,850
in two thousand thirteen or fourteen or

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,900
fifteen whatever we have the solution is

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,970
not obvious that CD fixed offline

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,450
distribution needs to be the reference

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,190
port it

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,740
it's a topic of discussion right I'm not

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,780
saying I am forcing an answer here it's

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,490
a like like James said in his talk it's

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,280
a matter of dead being evolving it's

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,630
consensus its but whatever it does has

00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,630
to be something that Debian is okay

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,270
calling official but the nature of what

00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,780
the reference is can be more situational

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,490
sometimes I think I'd like to echo what

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,320
Jimmy's I think you would even agree

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,630
that the the cloud really is another

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,930
architecture right it's just different

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,580
fundamentally from the the typical way

00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,310
that Debian has been installed and

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,080
published before I think maybe one of

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,640
the things that is really necessary it's

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,980
not just to think about what Google or

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,720
what Debian official is maybe there is a

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,330
Debian official right maybe there is

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,970
just the pure free software version that

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,980
only works on some clouds that have the

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,420
right tools and so forth you know saying

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,040
although all their software happens to

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,110
be open-source and all their API is or

00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,730
you can build everything outside of the

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,410
world outside of their world right but

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,820
sometimes I mean I don't think Google's

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,710
is like this and I don't think Amazon's

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:47,670
like this but I can easily see other

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:49,260
clouds needing more more proprietary

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,570
tools I don't think and that's something

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,400
that in that sort of circumstance I

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,680
would still like to see Debian having

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,510
some sort of branding which is there's

00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,350
the Debian official but then there's the

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,280
Debian inspired or the Deb you know yes

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,820
something like that

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,290
yeah I mean that Debian cloud edition

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,660
becomes work do we include things like

00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,280
SDKs and things like that or do we just

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,500
say well the SDKs if they're already in

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,440
main because obviously we are all

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,390
publishing our SDKs right as as DFG

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,740
compatible licenses let me put that in

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,080
the base let me take a step back from

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,850
what's in the image the customer

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,190
applications don't care what's in the

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,440
image the customer expectations care

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,510
what's easy for them to do that's all

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,640
they care about it is possible

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,040
so the reason it's useful to have in

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,290
packages in repositories in the image is

00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,730
because app lets you update things and

00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,620
lets you see what's installs and remove

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,780
and add things so the important thing

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,330
like if there's a way to avoid putting

00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,460
certain things in the image and have it

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,010
be easy for customers to use things in

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,180
ways that meet customer the needs of

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,160
people who are paying Google or Amazon

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,570
money or people who are paying GPL host

00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,760
money or what-have-you

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,500
the you know having a way to meet

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,560
customer needs is the goal it doesn't

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:05,310
matter so much what's the image yeah I'd

00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,830
like to have a look to what happened in

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:11,070
Ubuntu and you can do they have a cloud

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:13,530
image that works in most clouds okay

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,760
they made technical choices so that it

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,800
can happen

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:22,680
clouding it is an initiative from

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:25,560
canonical to do that and if instead of

00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,080
adding specific HP tools or Google tool

00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,290
or whatever to the image if we could

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,780
just contribute to cloud in it so that

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:36,870
it would we would continue to have a

00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,840
unified system and try to do it that way

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,640
for all the other components then maybe

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,090
we have a chance to have one unique

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,950
cloud image that will work for all it's

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:50,490
it's it's always good to improve

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,210
standards and as I say in the slide it's

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,560
a start

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:58,350
I think I'm happy for that but there's

00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,360
definitely things that cloud in it that

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,070
it's out of scope because cloud earn it

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,510
from what I understand it's even in

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:08,130
initialization time saying you know it

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:11,100
doesn't handle I mean maybe with upstart

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:14,910
or systemd it can handle Network changes

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:18,120
but for example any system v init system

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,530
or anything where the needs like I don't

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,440
think even upstart can handle account

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:25,860
management during the lifetime of a VM

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,270
you know just as an example so it might

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,550
be possible to change the scope of cloud

00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,140
or NIT or whatever but like it certainly

00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,120
won't handle the QA and testing workflow

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,740
right I mean we we need the problem is

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,380
broader do you think we're getting a

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,630
little too granular here I mean things

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,210
like puppet and chef and juju takeover

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,250
where that leaves off do we really need

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,990
that to be a part of any official build

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,660
as far as Debian's concern anyway the

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,810
whole point of debian is that it's it's

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,830
universal

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:55,890
right chef take you know ploughin chef

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,140
meet the customer specific needs as

00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,520
managed by the customer I would say lots

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,800
of customers will be installing puppet

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,800
or chef or juju on Debian and that's

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,940
great but I don't think I think for that

00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,049
very reason actually we

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,570
shouldn't interfere with whatever they

00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,000
do for their puppet or chefs install so

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,899
I don't think we're stepping on we

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,990
shouldn't step on them we shouldn't

00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:17,399
interfere with them but the I mean if if

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,159
there's some other easy way for them to

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:23,399
you know interact with whatever their

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,259
vendor environment is in a nice way

00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:28,379
I agree that we should only ship free

00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:29,730
software I'm fine with that but you know

00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:31,620
aside from the licensing side of things

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,659
you know the important things to apply

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,070
some way and I don't think it should be

00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,570
popular chef simply because the

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,120
customers will often use that and they

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,820
should control that I'm sorry I'm going

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,679
back to the content of the image yeah

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,190
the discussion of what should be in an

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,200
image and an official image I mean this

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,629
is the answer to what is an official

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,230
image exist Rhodey an official image is

00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:57,659
just free software there are some seedy

00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,909
image made by the beyond with non free

00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,789
frame where it's produced by Debian is

00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:05,159
not the official image right and if some

00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:08,340
package needs needs to be added to the

00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:11,159
in Debian for for specific clouds I

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:14,370
think it's not problem we have had h and

00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,950
a half which included more apparent

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,730
software to support and it was doing

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,820
doing

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:23,879
stable release sure well so as far as

00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:27,690
you know as far as unofficial images

00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:29,669
that are all free software Amazon and

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,740
Google already shipped those both of our

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:34,340
images contain only free software they

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,519
are built with only free software and

00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,539
they you know they are close enough to

00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,769
Debian that we've checked with the

00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,360
trademarks folks with that being it's

00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:45,809
fine to call it the Debian it's a

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,830
etcetera but they are not official

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:51,419
Debian which is a bug as I said so

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,850
there's no issue of like the non-free

00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:55,679
firmware CD images because we're not

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,690
shipping non-free software it's all free

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,970
software everything Google's release did

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,250
this is apache license yes but in the

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,830
same way if we think if an official

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:08,309
image can only be made with stuff in

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,470
Debian and that's easy to give so yeah

00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:13,860
the real problem here is is the time

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,080
frames right I think it is least from my

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,059
perspective Wow so when what kind of

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,519
poor

00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,470
Google creates new software to stick

00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,830
inside of their VMs new bug fixes new

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:27,230
features new features new bug fixes when

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,330
they enter the Google codebase and we

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,639
want to push them out to users it's

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,789
unclear to us how we get them into the

00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:39,159
Debian main tree quickly enough so that

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:41,779
we can push that image to to customers

00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,850
exactly and so our customers are then

00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:46,370
left with an experience in which they

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,620
can only use the official Debian image

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,690
with like a subset of the Google

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,100
features or they can use the other

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,100
operating system that looks and feels

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,990
like Debian which isn't really Debian

00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,940
does integrate how is that different

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:03,860
from imploding hardware support it's not

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,629
that much different except that our is a

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,179
different except that was except for the

00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:11,169
speed we upgrade our cloud every month

00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:14,240
or two yes a typical hardware

00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:15,409
installation of Debian the hardware will

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,830
not be changed every month or two

00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:24,980
whereas in the cloud it will so thing

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:27,049
but not for the same customer for this

00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,399
for new customers yes I mean we have a

00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,769
the thing is you're asking about

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,210
hardware support in Debian stable don't

00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,490
defend the status quo as a good thing

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,619
it's actually a big problem that one

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,539
month before we DS release squeeze was

00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:41,360
not usable on most machines that were

00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:43,759
recently released and Ben Hutchings had

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,009
a buff about that yesterday afternoon

00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,200
treating it as a problem to be fixed so

00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:51,320
I agree that that's the way it is in the

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,999
table and it's a bug as well so I think

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,519
there are two separate things here again

00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:57,080
one is the notion of what's efficient

00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,289
and what's not and there are the release

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,509
criteria so for the standard they've

00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:05,450
been releases we have a release team ok

00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:06,889
and it's not like the notion of they're

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,990
doing the official images is what

00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:11,090
concerned what constrained them to do

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,679
religious every two years right they can

00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,869
compromise so they cannot compromise

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,240
depending on how they work and they do

00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,440
decide their own release goals and try

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,539
to enforce them with the help of the

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,190
other developers so one thing are the

00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:24,350
criteria on what's efficient and what's

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,820
not and I think those criteria should be

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,730
entirely on the basis of Debian

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,440
practices and on the basis of software

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,529
in container images and

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,129
after used to build them the cost the

00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:38,480
sorry the the kind of release policy

00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:38,990
that should we use as something

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,360
different

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,940
sorry ideally what we should have is

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,110
something like a small release team just

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,149
because I'm assuming right now the

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:50,600
release team is not interested in also

00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:53,539
doing the release work for the images so

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,000
having small early steam for the cloud

00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:57,830
images that decides what are their

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,230
release policy for those images so

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,330
ideally they should be close to the

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,429
release policy for the main releases but

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,320
if there are specific cities of the

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,820
cloud environment it justifies having

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,000
different policies why not

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,889
so in the fact I think you should cut in

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,129
to how's the list of criteria you have

00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:18,590
some criteria will be to bless what is

00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:20,090
official and not and let's be clear

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,620
efficient or not just mean that is

00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,970
something that you are willing to

00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,519
promote on the main with Debian website

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,740
and so on so on and so forth they can

00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,899
exist other images somewhere else which

00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,610
are made by some random guy which just

00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:33,289
says okay this is I took Debian and I

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,090
rebuild it for this cloud it's not

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:37,340
promoted by Debian but I don't think

00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,320
we're going to chase him for trademark

00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,450
infringement any time soon okay as long

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,120
as it's not used the Debian name to ship

00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,889
malware or whatever okay and something

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,840
else are the release criteria the

00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:49,190
quality criteria and that's for me it's

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,259
an entirely different discussion maybe

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,389
what we need is just deciding who are

00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,279
the realism there at least people doing

00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:58,429
the cloud releases for specific clouds

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,549
and be done with that yeah and there's

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:03,590
certainly more ways of evolving the must

00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:06,529
be in main requirement without changing

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,139
the nature of it it might be must be in

00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:10,850
main in some part of Debian you know it

00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:12,679
must be available from the Debian

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,019
archive it might even relate to the new

00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,730
PPA main thing that the FTP team was

00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:17,929
talking about in May where there's going

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,639
to be additional faster-moving

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:21,559
repositories hosted on the Debian

00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:22,220
infrastructure I'm not wedded to one

00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,710
solution

00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,720
yeah I completely agree about the two

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,360
the two halves here but there's also the

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,929
third half would would which would also

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,730
help for anybody who's building an image

00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,620
instead of the release team right the

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,230
one of the problems that I know I have

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,049
is I run through build Debian cloud

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,179
right and I know I modified it to do x

00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,470
y&z add this package at this package

00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:47,600
move this packet remove this package

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:51,559
modify this file modify this file modify

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,929
this file is it good right I don't know

00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,240
right I think it's good it works for me

00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:58,999
it does all the stuff that I think my

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,340
customers expect but then the look and

00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:02,649
feel of Google's debian is slightly

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,100
different from the look and feel of

00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:08,480
amazon's debian a few extra packages

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,480
config files change password login

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,669
disabled route log and enabled disabled

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,190
who knows and and some of those are

00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:18,169
motivated motivated by like the security

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,259
teams at Google who are like no you

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:23,029
mustn't you mustn't allow login on your

00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:24,740
machines even via SSH because they're

00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:27,529
like every 30 seconds you can see

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,389
someone's trying to crack into the SSH

00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:32,269
there so let me add one on to that um

00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:34,190
what about deny hosts as default or fail

00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:37,429
to ban as default so right now by the

00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:40,159
way the Debian images do not disable the

00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,559
Debian images right now have permit root

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,999
loggin yes they would as he says they

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,830
would prefer that no because they are

00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:47,720
getting attacked every few minutes which

00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,909
I tracked on this though but what I

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,809
really want to have what I really want

00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:55,909
to know is what is what the standard is

00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:58,700
and even better yet have a set of tools

00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:02,179
that we can run that would say yes no my

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,940
package to do the beat OpenStack Debian

00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:11,379
image has been rejected by the FTP

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:13,519
masters because it was allowing default

00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:14,950
no no because because I've been said

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,549
she's not stalled and what about what

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,610
OpenSSH she's not installed by default

00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:21,440
ah well I mean this at the same time

00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,419
though our images don't have a root

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,450
password by default or root SSH keys by

00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:28,519
default so by default you actually can't

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,190
you there's no ability to access route

00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,230
via SSH so that issue is different it's

00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,999
it's a write by default you know we have

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,340
our key management thing with non-wood

00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:38,869
accounts and with us we do but but I

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,999
think deny us I mean that's one of the

00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:42,320
first things that I installed is that

00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:45,049
something that we should have in all of

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,360
our our cloud images and would be

00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:50,240
considered that as as an official image

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,859
um because we don't put deny hosting a

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,549
standard Debian image or should we that

00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:57,639
was my question

00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:59,809
well I

00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:02,809
for most question maybe we should just

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:07,940
go back to say is it's really specific

00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:09,800
to clouds yes yes it totally is I think

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,619
things are operating and is so different

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,450
no I don't I don't agree with deny house

00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,250
I think deny hosts is that is

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,379
universally useful as soon as you

00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,460
install SSH there's a probably a pretty

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:21,230
good chance that you should have deny

00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,820
host install or filed about or whatever

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,119
implementation they like which is those

00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,849
might be good things to add they're also

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,440
somewhat error-prone but I you know I

00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:32,690
mean in this case I should try to focus

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,909
on in general issues in this chat and so

00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,250
in in the concept of this point the

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,440
general issue is twofold one of them is

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,389
you know making sure that we can

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,820
validate things given the differences in

00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:47,540
the clouds and and across clouds and we

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:50,389
needed some QA but yes that the theory

00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,460
there are like the attacks every 30

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,389
minutes or every 30 seconds against root

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,980
on these machines

00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,329
it's more common in the cloud what I

00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,579
think is important is to provide our

00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:01,880
users to create the image they want yes

00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:04,460
so like if they want in a host to ban or

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,470
whatever if it can be your simple oceans

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,329
that you can switch on the tool that is

00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,220
building the imaging which hopefully

00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:12,109
will be main and then you have

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,530
everything solved and that is the case

00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:17,240
you basically say - - package whatever

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:23,000
and annas generator so is that in the

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:25,640
build script - yeah yeah I mean I think

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,680
the thing is customers we found don't

00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,599
want to run build Debian cloud to build

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,300
an image they just want something there

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,930
by default and maybe a couple of options

00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:38,569
that's all they want is but you provide

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,760
only one flavor of the image

00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:48,560
what about providing one which is the

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:51,470
basic standout and one which is we've

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,300
got two versions two main tracks and in

00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,880
those tracks we've got like a thousand

00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,410
versions of each Debian with different

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,319
versions of different things released

00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:02,990
and that's already a lot for our

00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:05,510
customers to ingest if we gave them 12

00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:07,819
more versions of each track with

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:11,359
different options or two even so this

00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:13,220
way before this is this is where blends

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,079
come in I mean should H blend be its own

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,119
image on the cloud if I want the startup

00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,280
Debian scientific should that be its own

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,859
image yeah that's one of the things

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,390
which i think is very interesting maybe

00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:27,170
you can talk about that later

00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:28,849
today you will tell one thing we could

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,520
do in Debian as well would be to provide

00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:34,099
appliances how about an image that does

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,760
HD poxy an image it is pre-configured

00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:39,380
for PHP or whatever so we have about 8

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,910
minutes left I just want to ask if

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,099
anybody who hasn't said anything has any

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,420
points they want a raise or ask I should

00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:50,420
just give a moment to ask that question

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:52,160
so I mention several release managers

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,800
one per cloud infrastructure I don't

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,119
even ok but I don't even see what that's

00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:02,300
needed because I'm totally fine with

00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:05,660
cloud providers customizing creating

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,940
custom Debian based images with all the

00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,300
customizations they want to make users a

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,010
user experience of our customers better

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:16,369
no we are talking about official Debian

00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:18,349
images I don't see why the cloud image

00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:22,910
on AWS should be different from the one

00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:26,210
and GC which I think the content I think

00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:27,680
the content should be and if the user

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,710
wants to do something different you can

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,599
just insert more packages to change it's

00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,490
it's not that the image needs to be

00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:36,079
different in any essential way although

00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:39,770
they actually have different formats to

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,589
some degree but it's more that they it's

00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,839
the same thing with s3 90 versus x86 you

00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:47,690
can probably install tools to interact

00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:49,970
with the remote s/390 machine on x86 or

00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:53,060
maybe those tools don't exist but cross

00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:56,450
compiling etc but there's no reason that

00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,160
a typical Amazon user would need gcutil

00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,500
there's no reason that a typical Google

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,930
user would need yuko tools they're

00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,069
allowed to use them though maybe we

00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,450
should actually have all our tools and

00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:07,339
all our images because there's nothing

00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,440
to set up an 82 instance calling your a

00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:11,930
they can totally do it you know I feel

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,130
exactly the same reason why my laptop in

00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,810
front of me shouldn't have the tools

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,760
available as well to do whatever

00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,869
interaction with it should all be able

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,680
to have good installed it's a question

00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:22,339
of what should be installed by default

00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,750
it will really need it from a user point

00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:25,900
of view

00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:31,180
yeah what it depends on what they're

00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:33,760
doing it's a good base image canister

00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:37,030
whatever they want for needs it's not

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,820
it's like if we decided that when you

00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,410
install Debian Shiva plug you had some

00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:45,130
bad because somebody is cool and usually

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:48,610
by using Shiva plug the real issue here

00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:50,800
is Debian has to choose I think if we if

00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,540
if you follow the consequence of your

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,810
logic Debian has to sort of choose

00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:58,630
whether whether they have the base true

00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:01,420
official Debian image that pretty much

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,920
nobody in cloud uses because it doesn't

00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,220
integrate with their with all the cloud

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,410
properties and or do you have versions

00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,720
or flavors of the official better I

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:13,390
usually have it in Hollands though yeah

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,730
its base plus enhancements to integrate

00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,050
them to the cloud and whether whether or

00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,490
not Debian wants to get into the

00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,370
business of calling any of those

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,870
official if they don't care then they

00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,520
don't care and maybe people will just

00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,200
maybe if some people will go and take

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,970
the base image and download all the

00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,950
tools and install just the right ways

00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,960
yes but that's complicated and hard and

00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,360
most people we find don't want to do it

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,530
and I think the important thing to say

00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,180
here is we're not talking about somebody

00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,800
who's installing one machine or someone

00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,790
is installing ten machines we're talking

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,890
about customers who are spitting up

00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,090
their twenty thousand machines for four

00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,930
hours then getting rid of them and

00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,640
they're doing the same thing the next

00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,500
day another yes you could do these

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,300
customizations and all of our images now

00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,520
support that you can script it it can be

00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,050
automated but if you have three minutes

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,550
of installing packages times twenty

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,010
thousand machines you've got a large

00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,610
amount of time that you've just wasted

00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,950
installing stuff that we could have

00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,690
already had already yes but you're never

00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,670
going to meet those people you know you

00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,740
can't play never ever people so those

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,300
people will not be able to use Debian

00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,490
official images they will customize it

00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,750
potentially so at some point we have to

00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:16,240
decide let's add some tasks in

00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,820
industrial and for more needs for you to

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,770
so one of the options that guy so took

00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,390
around that point you're totally right I

00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,950
don't think we need to have some

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,230
specific release manager for every

00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,840
single image it could be one and maybe

00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,640
you should your she or the team should

00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,720
consider differences for different

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,820
images but can be only a single

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,280
Authority but the point here I think

00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,610
your problem is that you lock out or it

00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,810
you

00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,270
you don't know which out are it in

00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,710
Debian as the final word on deciding

00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,120
whether a specific customization you are

00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,330
made is acceptable or not

00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,740
so in general Debian governance we solve

00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,330
this because we have packages and

00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,370
packages a very clear maintenance

00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,410
structure so even there are 10 different

00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:56,230
opinions on now something should be done

00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,150
the maintainer as the final word and for

00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,770
something which is more general like the

00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,270
release of Debian as a whole we have the

00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,130
release team which is the final

00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:05,950
authority to decide what goes in and

00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,840
what goes out okay we do not have that

00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,000
for Debian cloud so if you have done

00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,470
some specific customization you post it

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,720
to the dental mailing list and you get

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,070
five different opinions two of them are

00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,280
in favor all three of them are against

00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:20,950
so what we lack I think is a specific

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,960
alternative in deciding what can go in

00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,350
an official domain image and what cannot

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,090
go

00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,970
technically which is entirely different

00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:30,310
from what is blessed from a political

00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:32,470
point of view so ideally this would be

00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,270
some dish sorry this should be something

00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,770
which is part of their esteem pretty

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,540
much as in the release team we have

00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,750
stable release manager and there is

00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,160
manager 4d but if to start with they

00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,380
don't have the envy or they don't have

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,030
the the power or the energy to do that

00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,730
we should start with a small separate

00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,320
team which fits in the usual Debian

00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,600
governance structure which has the final

00:41:50,320 --> 00:42:02,530
word of technically what can go in and

00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:04,930
what cannot go in so with two minutes

00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,330
left let's keep talking but I just want

00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,400
to mention David and I and I think you

00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,990
and I think it from Amazon James and I

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,120
think Brian from eucalyptus and Thomas

00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,980
from GPO host I think we're here the

00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,510
rest of the time right anyway we're all

00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,890
here the rest of the conference so let's

00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,560
keep the conversation going and beyond

00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,930
the next can I add one other mix on this

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,550
and I wonder I get the room sir opinion

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:27,540
on this and we've talked about adding

00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,350
tools in what do we think about desktops

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,230
in the cloud

00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:34,480
yep desktops in the cloud as an ami I've

00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,940
played with it with RDP to a debian

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,170
instance on Hawk I live on quite a quite

00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,780
a number of milliseconds away from my

00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,830
local region but does anyone have a

00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:46,340
feeling or

00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:46,760
I know who's interested in that kind of

00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,050
stuff

00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,130
anyone show hands yeah okay hang around

00:42:51,050 --> 00:43:00,470
because we've got a 15 minute break

00:42:52,130 --> 00:43:02,000
between this and the next yep thanks

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,080
offered the cutting that gift ideas for

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,820
the conversation everybody

00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,820
