The Debian accessibility team aims at making Debian work nicely for people with disabilities. This of course means packaging accessibility-related software and bringing accessibility fixes in, but it also means integrating notions of accessibility into all stages of Debian, from d-i bootup to bug reporting. We will discuss past achievements and challenges ahead, which everybody can help with.

	00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:12,929
tomahto v0 so good afternoon everybody

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:15,809
so I would talk about basically

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:21,750
accessibility so making Debian for

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:24,000
everybody we first give my usual talk

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,970
about accessibility so for people who

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,670
are watching this you can skip like 10

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,570
or 15 minutes and if you have already

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,210
seen one of my talks I mean but for

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,090
people here maybe you haven't seen this

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:47,550
already can you tell me what the problem

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:51,360
with this for accessibility yes for

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,610
blind people for colorblind people yes

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,899
that's the problem that's one of the

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,210
problem for blind people

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,079
well there are versions text versions of

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,899
new blood

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,229
but for colorblind people that's the

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,909
most awful choice of colors because a

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,420
lot of people just cannot distinguish

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:14,010
between green and red and then look new

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,610
plot v change the colors and then it's

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,770
alright

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,700
there were research about which colors

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,640
are distinguishable by most people some

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,619
people can actually distinguish anything

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,340
at all but at least this should work for

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,619
really much more people the thing is

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,110
they don't like a person of people of

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,909
male people who are colorblind maybe

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,340
here there are some colorblind people

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,130
raise your hand if you are colorblind

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,909
there's nobody oh that's strange because

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:48,469
a pattern that's really

00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:52,789
yeah so what is accessibility just to

00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:56,240
give a definition so that means making

00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:59,090
it usable I everybody so the title of

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,110
the talk including with some people with

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,850
specific needs whatever they are of

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,740
course you would think about blind

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,950
people because that's something that

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,950
people see most often in the street etc

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,660
but also people who have just low vision

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,280
there are a lot of people here who have

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,670
low vision just because they have the

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,849
need glasses and glasses are actually an

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:26,180
accessibility tool to compensate for the

00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:29,269
disability and also people who are deaf

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,660
which who cannot hear what computer

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:34,880
maybe beeps or something like this

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,780
colorblind as we have seen

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,599
one-handed typing control ad backspace

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,489
with just one hand is not possible or

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:49,700
you use an elbow I don't know some

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:51,470
people with cognition issues so if you

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,930
make an interface which is really

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,950
complex then it's difficult almost

00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:00,260
impossible for some people people with

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,540
disabilities motor disabilities so

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,650
typing on the keyboard is not something

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,329
which is granted for everybody and

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,989
elderly people who basically have

00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:14,299
everything at the same time

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,769
unfortunately all of us will get old at

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:19,430
some point and so we will have these

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:25,280
problems so we will be concerned at some

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,670
point but also that might be you next

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,889
month

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,139
just because you break your arm and that

00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:32,750
you only have one hand to type on the

00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,940
keyboard or maybe you are in the

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,709
sunlight and you have your cell phone

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,920
and you cannot actually see the screen

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:42,560
so being able to ask for really high

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,599
contrast high luminosity and things like

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,970
this is something useful for everybody

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:51,349
actually because anybody can be in a

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,790
disability situation formal discussions

00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,489
about all of these that there are

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,180
accessibility how to's to have more

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,719
details about this

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,019
so it can be you tomorrow I hope it will

00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,810
it will not be but that can happen so it

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,209
depends mostly on the situation I don't

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,719
know some people in wheelchair won't

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,689
have problem with using a PC that's not

00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,680
probably because they can type on it and

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,530
vice versa

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,660
somebody can work but not use a PC

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,880
because they don't have hands so it

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,020
really depends on what you want to do

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,949
the situation what you have so it's not

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:36,060
something simple and something you have

00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:38,460
to know is that 10% of the people really

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,490
believe they are handicapped that's all

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,789
we do a lot and 20% of the people would

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:48,539
say in my daily life I have concerns

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:51,180
with using a PC but also opening a door

00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,470
or whatever so it's really a lot of

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,990
people who are concerned with

00:04:52,470 --> 00:05:00,000
accessibility for software I would argue

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,090
that this is all about freedom zero

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,310
because as was proposed by Stalin the

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,010
freedom zero is to run the program for

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,280
any purpose okay but running is a good

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:16,020
thing but being able to use it is even

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,409
better we discussed about it with each

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,659
other

00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:21,690
he said no for me it is really the

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:24,330
ability to run that is a legal ability

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:28,710
and ok that's because it's licensing

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:32,039
terms etc but then for a social an

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,620
ethical question we want to let people

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,900
use the software of course then we shall

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,960
said ok but it's not a requirement it

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,120
can be a feature etc if you are

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,699
excluding some people from your software

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,789
because they cannot use it that's really

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,250
concerned he said ok but then you can

00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,199
modify the software the problem is that

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,930
the people who cannot even use your

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,320
software with the would they really be

00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,759
able to modify it from blind people if

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,340
they cannot see the screen they cannot

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,590
make it accessible it's not possible for

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,320
instance our work on the Debian

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,800
installer was not possible to do by a

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:15,599
blind person because unless it is a

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,150
accessible he cannot work with it so we

00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:21,930
have to implement this we have to care

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,879
about this and not just think people who

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,590
need it will just implement it that will

00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:30,990
not happen so long text just to show a

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,419
few things so do you know define

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:37,360
something discrimination on the basic

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,900
and the basis of disability that means

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,479
[Music]

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,150
exclusion restriction with the effect of

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,659
impairing exercise of human rights and

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,000
fundamental freedoms so it's big things

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:53,610
including a denial of reasonable

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,310
accommodation so that means that not

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,349
making the little effort to make your

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,770
software accessible is actually

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:03,569
considered as discrimination it's not

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,090
something active you are not excluding

00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:08,879
somebody actively but by not doing

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:12,120
something and by writing some software

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,949
which a lot of people can use but a few

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,029
people cannot use you're actually

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:20,729
excluding them from something and when

00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,919
it's about social things for instance I

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,590
don't know social networks social

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,219
websites it's really unconcerned for

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:32,159
those people and of course reasonable

00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:36,210
accommodation is really fake they make

00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:39,029
some details not imposing a

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,729
disproportionate or undue burden okay

00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:44,150
it's not much more clear it's left to

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:49,770
people to decide what they think about

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:52,409
this okay so let's present a bit about

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,590
the hardware because some people don't

00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:58,289
know necessarily about this

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,819
so Braille of course is something that

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,629
people know about because they have

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,550
heard about it it's quite rare to use

00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,009
Braille actually because a lot of people

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,009
don't know brain so they would use

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:16,039
speech synthesis so the computer would

00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:19,620
say the words that it wants to express

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:22,440
conversely for the user if he cannot

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,689
type on the keyboard or use a mouse

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,619
where they can use a turistic

00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:31,709
or just a button that the press or just

00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:33,539
have their eyes moving and blinking the

00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:36,509
eye to actually click on something

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:40,199
because it cannot move anything at all

00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:41,849
so this is just a few elements there of

00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:44,540
course a lot of different Hardware

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:49,829
pieces that can be used for different

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:51,689
disabilities one important thing to

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,389
understand is that you should never

00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:56,189
focus on one technology for Braille as

00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,839
I've said a lot of people cannot read

00:08:56,189 --> 00:09:00,839
Braille so you cannot say it's

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,480
accessible because it's rail now and

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,480
also Braille devices are extremely

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,350
expensive I'd show this and conversely

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,889
speech synthesis is not perfect either

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:17,399
because sometimes you're in a noisy room

00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:19,470
also just hearing - just listening to

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,800
something doesn't give you the spelling

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,269
so it's for people who really need to

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,779
have the spelling for programming for

00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:30,050
instance speech synthesis is really not

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:34,490
convenient at all

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:37,259
so for Braille so this is a Braille cell

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,870
so we have little dots which are moving

00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:43,290
up and down I can show you I have one in

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:48,959
my back the idea is that we have impedes

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:51,629
or bars which push the dots and so we

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,360
put some of them together to form a line

00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:56,910
of cells and then we connect to the PC

00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,399
with USB serial etcetera so you would

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:06,180
like have sent 20 or 40 cells along each

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:09,750
other and then it costs 150 times the

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,540
number of cells euros typically so for

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,069
40 it's like yes yes yes several

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,870
thousand euros so it's all fully

00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:23,309
expensive okay so that was for hardware

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:26,189
and then for software one thing which is

00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:28,939
important to understand is that writing

00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:31,620
dedicated software is usually a bad idea

00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:34,050
so for instance there is a dubrow's

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,529
which was meant to be a browser for

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,370
blind people but then they don't support

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,290
JavaScript they don't support

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,839
GSS etc there are a lot of things that

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,570
they would have to implement and there

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:50,130
is not enough manpower to do this so

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,920
just make the existing application

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,890
accessible so Firefox of course to make

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,860
it accessible is a lot of work but it's

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:03,120
less work then rewriting the whole

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,730
JavaScript support etc so just use the

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,150
same software there is also a social

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,270
reason for this is that if you have your

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,940
own software and your neighbor your

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,040
colleague whatever uses another software

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,040
then he cannot help you and you cannot

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,710
help him on something and that actually

00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,839
a clue excludes people in the workplace

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,750
or schools place if you are not using

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:33,270
the same software so that's also one

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:35,370
reason to use just the same software so

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,890
concerning Debian so we are a

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,550
distribution there is also a trap there

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:44,190
even if you are using the same software

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:47,610
there shouldn't be any despecialized

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,339
distribution because the problem of

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,860
accessibility is really autocannon to

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,529
any kinds of concerns about using a

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,500
computer so for instance the idea of

00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:02,160
plans and tasks are really Auto canal to

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,120
this because there is functioned a task

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,959
for

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,600
I don't know medicine and then there can

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,510
be blind people who work on medicine and

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,010
same for music and whatever so this is

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,240
really something that has to be

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:21,270
implemented for all of these and all

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,209
school also of course when you write a

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,670
specialized distribution then you think

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,410
about your own needs or the needs you

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,540
are imagine about the people who are

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,880
using it and you're not thinking

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,430
globally and maybe your distribution

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,470
will work well for a blind person for

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,800
instance but not well for somebody with

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,200
just low vision and so in the end we are

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,450
duplicating efforts between blind

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,620
distributions low vision distributions

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,980
etc so that's not every day I'm not

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,900
saying that we

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,760
completely banned such kinds of

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,710
distributions because because they are

00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,590
really helpful as test beds they can try

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:04,030
new things new screen readers new

00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:07,090
technologies just to see how well it

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,370
works interact with users and then once

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,050
we have something which is stable we can

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,390
try to push them to mainline

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:19,600
distributions and then it's available

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:22,210
and globally so for me really the aim is

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,840
that we have accessibility available

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,110
everywhere

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,530
I'm not saying enabled everywhere just

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:32,800
available a library an airport practice

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,660
room etc just because you don't want to

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,610
have to ask for the season mean to

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,060
install some software so that you can

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,890
use the software the computer for

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,260
instance at the airport there's no way

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,290
you can find and then minces I to school

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,780
yes the admin sees is not so far away

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:53,860
but he doesn't have the time to do it

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:56,830
cetera if the distribution does this for

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,430
everybody by default then yes it's a

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:02,920
variable so the idea is just its

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:06,160
installed by default ready for use and

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,810
you just have to press shortcut or plug

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,170
something on whatever to actually

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:13,090
trigger enabling the support so for

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,430
instance in the Debian installer that's

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,560
what happens when you have the boot

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,590
prompt you can type s enter and then you

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,500
have speech if you have rail device you

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,990
just plug the Braille device via USB and

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,460
then the Debian installer knows oh you

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,970
need to use a Braille device let's

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,120
enable support for this and then it's

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:39,910
it's really it's done for the Debian

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:42,520
installer part so just to give a global

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,630
overview on the accessibility support in

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:50,410
the free software so text mode is not

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:52,420
truly a problem but the problem is just

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,730
that it's not for beginners a lot of

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,000
people would say but yeah there's text

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,100
mode things and that's fine it is fine

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,820
for technical people it's not for

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,840
beginners so there's graphical mode so

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,000
known has

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,780
a lot of support so GTA applications

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,730
notably on quite well accessible we had

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,650
an issue with genome 3 because they

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,360
rewrote a lot of things and then a lot

00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,840
of things were lost

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,640
concerning accessibility the thing is we

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,600
are really late compared to Windows

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:29,290
which has which started to work a lot a

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,990
lot of time before us and compared to

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,150
Apple we out Stone Age just because

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,340
Apple really made the effort to

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:40,570
integrate accessibility into their

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:43,450
product so it's unfortunate but a lot of

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:47,020
people in the blind communities say just

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,820
buy Apple stuff because it will work and

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,280
you can say no you should use free

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,970
software bike I cannot use it I will use

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,540
Apple that's a concern and that's one of

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,370
the reasons which are starting to

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,140
convince which shots tournament that it

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:08,110
has to be a priority actually so this is

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:12,940
how it looks like how it looks like so

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:15,610
we have an application here which has an

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,400
abstract representation of the content

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,670
of the application from which it does

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:25,090
the visual rendering the usual rendering

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:27,670
but then also a screen reader here can

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:31,270
access to that representation through a

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:34,390
bus and then it can render this on the

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:37,630
next ability device beat Braille speech

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,910
something else let's the ID is really

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,070
generic you don't have to know when you

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,140
are writing here you know abstract

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:49,960
representation how it will be rendered

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:50,530
for the user so how it looks like in

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,130
practice

00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,900
so you have the X server where there is

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,830
the rendering the usual rendering done

00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:02,620
by Pango but then gtk also exposes the

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,840
content through ATK and then the screen

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,560
reader here and awk I can get the text

00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:12,580
and then push that to Braille and speech

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:14,410
so it's called a TSP I the pass which is

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,950
between the screen reader and the

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,950
application

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:24,059
come in regions what happens is that oka

00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:27,059
asks ATK gives me the text and then ATK

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,980
provides the task and conversely ATK

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,410
notifies occur when there is a

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,350
modification so orca doesn't have to

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:37,590
Paul every millisecond or something and

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:42,210
that only happens when a screen reader

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:45,120
is running so it's not a problem to make

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,940
accessibility available it doesn't slow

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,740
down application when it's enabled yes

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:55,010
there is more things to do here but

00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:02,159
enabling it just making it available

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:04,860
doesn't cost one give away a slide for

00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:07,440
programmers the idea is that you

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,620
shouldn't think about the graphical in

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,309
user interface but the logical user

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:16,409
interface it's just like CSS and HTML

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,350
you have you the structure of your page

00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:22,679
and then you have CSS to layout things

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,130
etc so when you're writing a dialogue

00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,679
back just put the elements logically and

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:34,080
then the screen reader we'd be able to

00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:36,059
do its job take care of widgets just use

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,940
the standard widgets provided by the

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:42,270
toolkit so for instance if you have text

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,210
with the label there is the labeled text

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:48,270
field which includes both and that is

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:52,590
correctly interpreted by the screen

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:54,870
reader if you really have to write your

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,390
own widget then you have to implement

00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,010
the etiquette part to expose the

00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,850
information that you have in your widget

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:04,950
and at any rate you have to always

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,140
provide a text or alternative to

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,200
whatever you are showing to the user so

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,850
if you have an icon an image whatever

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,159
which is not text then you have to

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,679
provide an alternative text even if it's

00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,470
standard with yet well you have to

00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:24,900
provide to that standard widget with the

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:27,750
text for it and key tips simple that's

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,260
something that people repeat just for

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,030
common sense

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,480
it's especially important for people

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:36,490
with cognitive issues so if you make

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,800
something simple they will be able to

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,320
use the soft one that will also be

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,180
useful for everybody because then the

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,150
software is nicer to use because it's

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:51,510
more simple so in the end it's

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:54,250
interesting to do this ok so that was

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:57,040
the talk about accessibility in general

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,550
now I will be talking about Debian in

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:05,910
particular so the Debian accessibility

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,910
team was founded quite a long time ago

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:14,470
so just to give the resources so there's

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,900
a slide so you can have it on the

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,870
website to have the pointers so we have

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,810
an IOC channel we have a mailing list

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:27,010
for discussions a mailing list for bug

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:31,690
reports and uploads notifications etc we

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:33,760
have the the marketplace let's say for

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,700
the beyond accessibility which explains

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,850
the goals of the team etc and then there

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,660
is the workplace so there are three wiki

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:46,000
pages the first is for users the blind

00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,640
people deaf people etc the people who

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,650
actually need accessibility so they need

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,560
to know how it works what configuration

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:57,250
they can have etc then there is

00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,140
development wiki for people who are

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,710
implementing things in Debian

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,770
accessibility and then a third one which

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,600
is for maintenance in Debian that is

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,690
that's a page which is meant to be

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,730
between the accessibility team and the

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,150
other teams of Debian on whatever

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:20,290
developer who is interested in thinking

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,240
about accessibility so that's why we

00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:26,560
have these three pages they will have

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:30,490
different targets so of course the

00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:33,220
accessibility team works on packaging at

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:36,490
least to drive the specific hardware

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:40,420
that we have seen so for speech and

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,970
Braille then there are the software

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:46,330
drivers so implementations of

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:49,000
assistant tools so points on speech

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:53,049
synthesis software speech synthesis all

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,659
recognition for Braille we have a lot of

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:59,049
tools to actually translate Braille and

00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:01,720
both Braille recognize bread there are a

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:03,909
lot of things and then there's a lot of

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,260
things that can be implemented so

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:09,850
zooming the screen changing the colors

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,010
handling the keyboard in in another way

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,350
so that if you type a key several times

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,289
because you have a Packingtown issue

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,970
then it's not a problem etc so there are

00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:23,440
a lot of things at the software layer

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:26,020
which can be packaged then there is the

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,620
screen reading stack so I've talked

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:32,710
about it a tsp I so we have a few

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,570
packages to implement this so oka is the

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,450
screen reader and then there are a lot

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,789
of eg SPI something packets which

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:43,720
implements the link between the screen

00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:46,210
reader and the applications then we have

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,960
a couple of software which are dedicated

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:53,799
to people with disabilities so for

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,460
instance for reading books Daisy books

00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:59,710
ebooks we have software for this it

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:03,159
makes sense to make a dedicated software

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:07,919
in this case because they have really a

00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,919
special rendering of the of the content

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:15,220
it could be discussed that it should be

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:19,360
shared well for now it's like this we

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:22,140
have two tools in the wiki page not all

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,030
the packages we would like to package

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,370
have been done

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,830
because we don't have so much so many

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:32,650
people working on this so if you can

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:36,670
help there is already work to do here

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:39,340
and also back pots for instance for

00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,940
drivers of course when we have a new

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:45,460
paradise then old releases of Debian's

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,760
are missing the drivers so we are doing

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,970
some back pots of 22 why at least to be

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,170
able to drive these so that was

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:59,230
packaging but that's one of the things

00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:01,000
which is not so complex in a way the

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,060
more complex thing is discussing with

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,250
other teams to integrate accessibility

00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,740
into the distribution really

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,630
so first stuff I will talk about the

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,060
Installer because historically that's

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:16,410
one of the things that we have done and

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:18,460
it took a long time to get where we are

00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,860
but then there are a lot of things that

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,050
we could do and we have done some of the

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,880
things and some others we would like to

00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:31,660
do is a matter of doing the discussion

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,250
so let's talk about the Installer so the

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:37,840
Debian boot mailing list basically

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:40,330
supporting accessibility within the

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,640
Debian installer means supporting

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:46,810
Braille speech high-contrast so that's

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,590
what we have implemented so far one

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,940
thing we would like to do is having

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:55,510
making the graphical installer

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:58,690
accessible but that means putting the

00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,700
atsp I stuck into the Installer running

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,850
the screen with the orca which is based

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:07,030
on Python Python is not in the Debian

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:11,980
installer yet so there's still work to

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:15,640
do just to discuss on these it takes

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:18,220
some space on the Debian installer image

00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,250
so for instance speech is not available

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,760
on the smallest image because the voice

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,920
is for speech take quite some space and

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,960
so it's available on only on the

00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:34,150
graphical image which is fine enough

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,160
it's it's compromise between we would

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,960
like to make everything accessible etc

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,460
okay but at some point

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,740
we have to choose because for instance

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,980
mini easels which are supposed to be

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:48,910
just like a couple of dozens megabytes

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:51,640
big we cannot put speech on these it's

00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:56,200
not possible technically ok let's make a

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,530
compromise then there is a question of

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,650
bootstrapping that's not something that

00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:04,809
you would think about at first if you

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:08,110
start the Debian installer so you insert

00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:11,350
the CD you press on and then you have

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,540
good menu and if the user doesn't know

00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:15,520
that the bit menu is showing up on the

00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:19,090
screen he doesn't know that it has he

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,360
has to press ENTER so it took quite some

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:26,110
time to make the discussion to just add

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,580
a bit at that point and then why and

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,170
there were discussions just because okay

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,600
but then that's a bit that can disturb

00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:35,260
all the people etc and you cannot skip

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,090
that step discussing with Debian boot to

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:41,830
find a compromise that Debian boot

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:45,010
accepts and what's more interesting will

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:47,170
defend it happened like I don't know one

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,390
or three years after we implemented this

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,970
a user complained that there is a beep

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,020
at the boot menu and I thought ok we

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,360
will have to restart the whole

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,030
discussion and no what happened is that

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,679
the Debian put people themselves

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:03,250
explained no we need this because this

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,380
and that cool that means that the Debian

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,870
accessibility team didn't need to do

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,330
anything anymore about that point it's

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:14,670
integrated really understood you cannot

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,670
skip that part and then that's for good

00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:21,400
so that was the beep at the boot prompt

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:24,400
and of course when you have a USB thing

00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,530
you just you can just plug and then that

00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,350
part doesn't need a compromise that's

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,809
fine you can plug something it doesn't

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:36,130
disturb the normal way of installing

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:39,880
Debian so that's fine a discussion that

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:43,059
happened in the latest releases was the

00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,270
choice of the default desktop we were

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:48,929
happily surprised that Debian put Debian

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,700
boot people took care of choosing

00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:54,490
desktop which is accessible

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:58,269
because yes what is the pest default is

00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:01,090
it is it the the the most technically

00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:04,149
advanced desktop for Debian which is

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:07,149
about diversity and making the world

00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:11,200
better etc no it means everybody can use

00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:14,710
it so it makes sense to choose an

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,309
accessible desktop maybe not the most

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:21,220
accessible in that technically

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:27,610
accessible but that is something that

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:30,159
everybody can use so the discussion was

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,620
basically between DOM and Matty because

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:37,570
others have problems Katie wasn't ready

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:40,360
at the time etc in the end I think we

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:42,269
chose genome because it had zooming

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,720
support integrated while Matty didn't

00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:48,730
even if Matty has less keys

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,639
accessibility glitches then you know it

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:57,389
genome has wider support that's why we

00:28:51,639 --> 00:29:00,399
chose it so that was for installing

00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:04,630
there's live CD which is quite next to

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,789
to it in terms of distribution there is

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,240
some support in the live CD apparently

00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:12,220
you can press mito alt s to start the

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,289
screen with it seems to work

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,830
there is probably some tuning to do in

00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:21,940
there and bootstrap support we have it

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:24,909
with meter alt s I don't think plugging

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,399
a Braille device will enable Braille

00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:30,429
automatically so there are things to do

00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:32,950
here we have to discuss with the live CD

00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:35,559
people again to make sure that things

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,840
are integrated and not just patched over

00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,460
and get skipped at some point because

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:45,940
they don't understand it they don't

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:49,960
understand why how et cetera then there

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:52,870
is the technical part for desktop

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,100
accessibility so toolkits for first so

00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:59,679
gtk cute etc so what we need is making

00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,410
sure that the toolkits are accessible so

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,230
that the 80k part I mentioned before

00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:10,640
to make them accessible via the best

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:12,560
accessibility bus so for a long time

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,000
this wasn't enabled by default

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,590
that means you install Debian and it's

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,360
not have enable you have to configure

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:25,910
something so that it works last debconf

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:29,060
in Germany so not not the very last but

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:31,400
the one I was the but I said maybe we

00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,710
should enable it by default so available

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,730
by default and then you just start the

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,190
screen reader and we did it we start we

00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,440
enabled it and there were some

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,840
regressions when we but we took the time

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:49,000
to fix the bugs and eventually in debian

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,730
9 we have GT k23 and cute 4 5 and java

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,310
accessible so it didn't go without

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:59,330
problems but at least now it's achieved

00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:02,480
and i hope we won't revert this so that

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:05,870
covers basically most applications not

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,710
all of them unfortunately so for

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,890
instance GK so from tickle TK is not

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,970
accessible there are quite a few

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,760
applications which which are really

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:20,120
useful I don't know like gtk things

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,190
deities so it will be it would be really

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,970
nice to have accessibility support there

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:30,680
a new step is not accessible Sdn is

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:33,320
difficult to think about because it's

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,260
not really targets probably we won't be

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:40,220
able to do accessibility there and then

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,930
there are the old ones I've left any

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,340
kind of hope that these will be made

00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:51,380
accessible unfortunately but in practice

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:53,390
that's not so much a concern then there

00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,880
are the desktops it's not the same

00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:58,250
question of course for a desktop to be

00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,830
accessible it needs to use a toolkit

00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:03,110
which is accessible but then you have to

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:07,310
make sure that the bus the accessibility

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:12,770
bus does work so does how does it work

00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:15,350
we actually have a deepest on this so in

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,880
you have a notion of deepest session and

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,460
then you have 80s

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,800
via demons which starts at the start of

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:26,120
the desktop session and which discuss

00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:29,900
via Debus and that's something that if

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:32,630
your desktop is not so well doing things

00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:35,360
properly there's a problem there and it

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:40,160
doesn't work so normally it just works

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:44,420
by this file so an xtg autostart file

00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:49,570
and then if the desktop respects xdg

00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:53,420
then it does work it didn't always work

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:54,850
but at the moment the ones we tested it

00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:58,580
seems to be working

00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:00,860
there's a second thing so activity is

00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,410
working okay good but then you need a

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,230
way to bootstrap as I've said that is

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,750
you have a computer which is already

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,250
starting and you want to enable we need

00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:13,280
the screen reader you need a shortcut

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:18,020
for this so gnome decided to use super

00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:21,200
alt s hopefully other desktops will just

00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,880
use the same shortcut so that it's just

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,040
the same documentation from all kinds of

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,590
computer just press this and then you

00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,010
have a screen reader really I hope that

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,900
someday

00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,030
whatever the computer you just press

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:38,170
this and then you have speech that would

00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:41,500
be really great so whom do you test this

00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:44,180
you have little

00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,630
repository for this you have some

00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,760
environment Bibles to set to enable

00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:53,390
accessibility in these and then make

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,060
check will check that these are actually

00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,700
working and if it doesn't work there's a

00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,140
script which shows you which technical

00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,470
elements are not working

00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:06,110
precisely so that we be able to start

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,889
understanding what is missing you can

00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:11,810
also start our car - L to check whether

00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,149
the screen reader is able to see the

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,980
list of applications I'm not saying that

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:18,770
you should try to use a screen reader

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:21,440
etc because there's a learning curve for

00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:26,330
this but at least you can run this to

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,140
check that it seems to be working okay

00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,760
so backed with desktops

00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:32,400
it's not finished because you have

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,620
display managers so before getting to a

00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,110
desktop you have this you have to type

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:41,190
your login password if it's not

00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:44,760
accessible people cannot login so again

00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:48,060
you have to make the a th bi bus working

00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,520
have a way to start the screenreader and

00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,440
so that somebody enters a practice room

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,690
at the university or whatever take

00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,690
whatever computer press the shortcut and

00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:04,260
then can start working logging and get

00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:05,420
to a desktop start things etc so for all

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,580
of this

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:11,970
Simon canes started something which is

00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,950
not official yet it seems to be working

00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,390
quite nice not for everything but at

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,530
least we have some beginning of

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,960
something that could be tested

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:23,670
automatically to check that for all

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,130
kinds of desktops in Debian things are

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,800
working right so properly we would like

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,830
to include this in the quality assurance

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,550
page at some point when it considered

00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:38,100
step stable enough so that developers

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,890
actually see a red light saying there's

00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,610
something wrong with your package

00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,130
accessibility wise okay

00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,040
let's talk with accessibility people we

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,100
will see what is going on so that at

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,370
least people not accessibility people

00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:58,470
but other developers are aware of the

00:35:53,370 --> 00:36:02,430
issue and and they would be looking for

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:07,290
this first before asking for help from

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:09,870
Debian accessibility people there are a

00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:16,320
lot of other things I could talk about

00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:19,140
just to give a few items so I've talked

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,390
about the desktop the login screen but

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:25,080
before that there's the boot menu so I

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:29,400
mean grab things like this ideally we

00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:32,780
would have accessible grub there's work

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,940
happening in grub about this it's

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,630
progressing slowly maybe at some point

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,060
we could have it

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,480
there's one interesting alternative

00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:47,320
which is a pity boot which is a small

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,910
boot program which runs in userland that

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,400
means that you have a first boot loader

00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,950
which is not accessible which loads just

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,620
a Linux kernel to just run pity boot

00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:00,190
with the screen reader and then this one

00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,990
you can actually access a boot menu and

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,920
then you press enter and it starts

00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:07,780
another kernel and the real system so it

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:13,060
could be an ID to integrate in the

00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:16,300
distribution automatically so that was

00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:20,410
for the technical parts then there is

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:22,450
all the really community parts so for

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,570
instance Deb Burke's so the back

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,330
tracking system recently got an

00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:30,250
accessibility tag which is really

00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:33,070
interesting for us to be able to track

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,720
easily which bugs are a concern for

00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,900
Debian accessibility it's a trap because

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,210
of course accessibility works on not

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,240
only in the packages that we maintain

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,430
but in other package I don't know for

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,680
instance in Firefox when you were moving

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:50,470
to the end of the page with Braille

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,620
device then the cursor would go out of

00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:56,140
the screen and you wouldn't see on the

00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:59,080
screen what the user is actually reading

00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,090
and that's not a problem for the user

00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,790
but for the people who are working with

00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:06,730
him that's a problem and that was a bug

00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:08,910
in Firefox and we are interested in

00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:12,460
tracking this so we added the

00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:17,680
accessibility tag so we are aware of

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:20,520
when it is fixed etc concerning the

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,350
release we could suggest that

00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:27,760
accessibility bugs could be considered

00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:32,980
release critical of course that has to

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,850
be discussed etc that means if it's a

00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,690
pack which makes the user the user less

00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,290
efficient

00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:44,320
okay it's not release critical but if it

00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,450
presents somebody from using a computer

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,060
that's really really is critical because

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:51,040
somebody's excluded from being able to

00:38:49,060 --> 00:39:10,690
use a computer

00:38:51,040 --> 00:39:12,490
so that could be considered yeah so just

00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,320
to repeat the beginning you agree that I

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,700
agree with you we should go all

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,170
accessibility bugs should be really

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:23,530
critical the problem is that you cannot

00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,630
delay a release from whatever bugs

00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,210
accessibility bugs so that has to be

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,960
discussed and then you say regressions

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:34,300
should be release critical ideally yes

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:39,370
at some point probably it will happen

00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:41,260
that we say okay too bad that again

00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,420
that's to be discussed we cannot set

00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,360
rules and it's etcetera I cannot

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:51,580
emphasize more always we have to discuss

00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:54,760
with teams okay then there are DEP tags

00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:57,850
so for people who doesn't know that so

00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,180
depth tax on tax put on packages to

00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:02,650
knows things about the package what does

00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,530
it do how it is implemented

00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:08,650
what kind of it ins face it provides etc

00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:11,050
so something which was added was the tax

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,080
accessible with so it's available now

00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:17,590
and then we need to put to actually put

00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,600
them on package so that we have a set of

00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,910
package okay but a lot of them are not

00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,310
accessible a lot of them are accessible

00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:28,060
for people with disabilities they don't

00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:30,070
know yet which one is or not and it's

00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,260
really a pain to have a start menu good

00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,270
a lot of applications and then you find

00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,510
that no this is not exhibit okay I take

00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:39,520
another one this is our if we can have a

00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:42,400
set which was really tested as

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,680
accessible then we could implement

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,500
something which only shows the

00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,720
applications which are accessible for a

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,360
given kind of accessibility

00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,040
accessibility technology because some

00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,320
applications could be usable with

00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:01,880
Braille but not with speech or vice

00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:03,410
versa so we have to put tags there

00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:08,780
and then there is a lot of documentation

00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:11,000
that we should put somewhere so the

00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,820
developer reference a new maintenance

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,340
guide so to explain these things I've

00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:18,500
shown the accessibility bus so that they

00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,430
know they are aware of this kind of

00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:25,190
dishes the importance of this maybe

00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:27,920
there could be some bits in the Debian

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:31,490
policy about accessibility I don't know

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,090
yet just thinking maybe there are some

00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:37,730
things we could think about

00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:39,620
we should talk with derivatives just to

00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,110
explain them because it's good to make

00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,450
the DPI onyx installer accessible but if

00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,280
derivatives actually break this because

00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:50,540
they don't understand how it is working

00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,030
etc then our aim is lost we would like

00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,620
to make all derivatives accessible and

00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,960
ideally they don't have to do any work

00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,720
about this maybe they need to know about

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,430
some things so they don't disabled for

00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,650
instance to beep because they say oh

00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,910
it's no you have to keep it it's

00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,620
important okay

00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:11,560
that's the kind of documentation

00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:14,390
probably we have to do yet and then one

00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,790
thing also for that comp so we are at

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,880
the conf making sure that they are

00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:23,330
accessible so some work has already been

00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,150
done I know just at least because some

00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:28,190
people have asked for it

00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,680
but making sure that they are settled in

00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:33,110
in the documentation etcetera so that

00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,590
even if nobody is asking for it it's

00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:39,530
available and if somebody just comes

00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,880
without telling before then okay fine

00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:45,020
it's already ready

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,780
the building is accessible we have

00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:53,570
recording we have text versions of the

00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:58,370
material etc one thing I would like to

00:42:53,570 --> 00:43:00,770
emphasize it's a big issue I didn't have

00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,960
time to even answer on the list about it

00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:07,340
because I don't know how to solve it

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:10,580
it's some support in the console the

00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:13,120
thing is these sort of people say that

00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:16,000
you shouldn't run pool so do as root

00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:18,100
okay but then the problem is that

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,760
the screen reader is running as root

00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:24,160
usually it has to run before you login

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,080
because if you don't have a screen

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,460
reader to be able to log in you cannot

00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:34,960
log in so there's there are conflicting

00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:39,160
things here and we have to again discuss

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,650
with them to find something the kinds of

00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,290
issues we've been having is it doesn't

00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:46,330
just doesn't work or we have concurrency

00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,430
on the Sun board between the screen

00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,140
reader for the text console and the

00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:53,230
screen reader in the graphical console

00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:55,510
things like this so we really need help

00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,840
here from people who actually understand

00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,700
also do as etc and to make sure that we

00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,490
have something which works for now it

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:08,830
doesn't really work so that's really a

00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:11,710
concern last but not least how to get

00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:14,740
involved so as usual just showing the

00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,900
list etc the problems we see is that

00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,700
people would say I don't know how that

00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,000
is supposed to work accessibility I

00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:24,490
don't know anything about it etc I

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,620
didn't know about it when I started I

00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:31,000
just learned on the way up to here they

00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,910
would say I don't know their needs and

00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,160
that's indeed something which is

00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:38,920
difficult to understand what is actually

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,260
needed how the user are actually using

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,360
the computer etc that's a long learning

00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,160
I've been working on these kind of

00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,950
things for like 15 years I've been

00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,980
discussing with some people for a long

00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:53,650
time so now I'm quite an expert on this

00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,860
and I cannot say that you can magically

00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:59,710
become an expert that's fine just come

00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:02,580
on the list and discuss and we can find

00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:05,890
ways and even I don't always have the

00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:08,040
correct thinking and I keep asking the

00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:11,020
users how do you think it could work

00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:15,270
could this work could that work and

00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,290
things like this a common

00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,820
misunderstanding is I don't have the

00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,560
hardware I don't have Braille device I

00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,750
don't have 15 titties that's not a

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,670
problem we have virtual things for all

00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,580
of these so virtual Braille device we

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,200
have speech synthesis can be software

00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,500
speech synthesis so that

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,250
not a concern a last thing I don't know

00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,560
how to actually test how it works so we

00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,150
did document how to test the Debian

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,730
installer for instance with Braille

00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,880
speech etc for other kinds of

00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:47,140
applications so we have a list of

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,880
software that we maintain in the

00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,490
building accessibility what is missing

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,800
is to document how to test them for a

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:55,450
few of them we have done it but for

00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,960
quite a few of them it's not done yet

00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:01,810
and so I really welcome people either

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,360
who are already using it and then just

00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:07,420
document or you're not using it but okay

00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,790
let's take time to try to use it and

00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,840
then discuss maybe with users and then

00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:16,810
write something and I mean I don't know

00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,840
how to use these either so I would just

00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:24,670
take the same time as you and to do this

00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:28,030
so you can come and try so to conclude

00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:30,370
quite a few users need accessibility in

00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:32,290
all kinds of situations so we want to

00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:36,220
make accessibility mainstream so it's

00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:38,710
available everywhere just ready to get

00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:41,080
enabled so join the list read

00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:44,830
accessibility mains because that's the

00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:48,520
one normally probably all developers and

00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:48,930
maintainer should know about so you're

00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:59,580
welcome

00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:59,580
thanks and I welcome questions

00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:32,830
what is the meaning of the sign yes I'm

00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,510
here still not so long this evening but

00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:39,590
then tomorrow I'm there the whole day

00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:44,669
long so you can come and discuss Thanks

00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:44,669
