	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:11,280
really hello my name is Jonas and I'm at

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:15,059
Debian developer I will talk about ways

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:28,730
that you can trust your computer and

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:28,730
trust your operating system so they

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,030
typically when you're talking about a

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,610
security and privacy and protecting

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,660
yourself a common thing is to talk about

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:46,050
it you want to secure things and the

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,690
word has a meaning but what I have found

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,280
a lot is that the word does not have the

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,520
meaning that you need so I will start

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,399
out with trying to kill the word secure

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,100
if you go to a shop or if you talk to a

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,439
technician then and they talk about

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,320
things being secure then it's completely

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,820
 from your point of view not

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,170
from the part of you they're not lying

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,970
to you but from your point of view as a

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,900
consumer as a user it's a non technical

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,490
person you want something that is

00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,479
trustworthy you don't want something

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,700
that is secure why because if you think

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,680
about it if I hope that I'm right here

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,770
this is not something that I have

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,360
verified and have authenticated with the

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,369
experts it's something that I have

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,540
thought about myself and you are welcome

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,280
to shoot me down after they talk okay so

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,549
what I've thought about is the word

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,070
secure what it really means is that it

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:51,630
is not changing so it is reliable

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:55,110
meaning that it does what it was

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,180
intended to do and that's all very well

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,399
and good like if you compare two cars

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,430
computers compared to cars as a couple

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,009
common thing if you drive with your car

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,069
and you come to a bridge crossing some

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,009
big gap and you don't want to fall down

00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:13,680
then is it secure

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:16,200
well the bridge can be very very secure

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,719
meaning that it is doing what it was

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,640
intended for and still you can crash if

00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,180
you come with a big truck filled with

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,819
there with something heavy then you can

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,680
crash on this bridge if it was not

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,280
secured for the thing that you need it

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,430
to cured for so there's this thing of

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,659
like which context are you talking in

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,900
it's not enough that things are secure

00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,389
it depends on what security what do what

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,989
are you talking about is this an old

00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:47,790
movie with the well this person is is

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,730
keep talking about is it safe

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,650
is it safe and there's also these people

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,169
calling in a phone line and saying is it

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,389
a safe line what what is that

00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,799
it depends on what you mean it depends

00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,450
on well is a this person standing next

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,560
to you it doesn't really matter if the

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,859
line is encrypted is it secure depends

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,389
on what security against what you have

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,959
to know your enemy some other security

00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,519
expert says I am I'm getting this thing

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,230
in my head when when people talk about

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,150
your enemy I don't want to talk about my

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,370
enemy I want to I want to have be safe I

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,709
want to I want to be I want to have

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:28,290
privacy I want to protect myself I don't

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:31,530
want to talk about enemy pictures but so

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,859
security the word secure means different

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,590
things depending on the context it just

00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,689
means it just means that things are

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,479
boring that it doesn't change a bridge

00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:44,340
is boring but it might not be secure for

00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,319
what you are doing with the bridge if

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,659
you're jumping good up and down on a

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,639
bridge then maybe it breaks even if it

00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,319
was secure enough for what the

00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,599
government was authorizing the bridge to

00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:00,389
do what you really want to do with your

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,000
computer I am assuming here sorry what

00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,280
I'm talking about here is a person like

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,060
you and me and my mother and my father

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,000
and my brothers who wants to run their

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,489
computer and be feel safe I'm not

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,419
talking about geeks I'm talking about

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:21,299
experts here I'm not an expert in a lot

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,940
of things I'm an expert in a little in

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,880
small pieces of the whole picture so all

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,770
of us are non experts in most of the

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,419
things here

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,830
so what we want is to keep safe from

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,409
harm

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,849
there's the classical term of up where

00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:40,520
you have nothing to hide so you don't

00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:41,810
need to care about these things sure you

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,460
don't need to care if you have nothing

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,259
to hide nothing to lose nothing to

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,930
hijack nothing to disturb nothing to

00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,270
interrupt if you have no presence

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,430
digitally then sure you don't need to

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,580
care about digital stuff but then you

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,229
wouldn't need to buy a new computer so

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,669
the very thing that you want to buy a

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:03,830
new computer means that you have some

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:09,680
reason to care about your data on this

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:14,060
Internet understand a computer what you

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:19,130
need to do is to establish trust you

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:22,460
need to you need to believe in someone

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:24,409
else in what you're doing and what when

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,849
you buy a computer you go to a shop you

00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:28,310
talk to a sales person and the sales

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:31,159
person says this machine is great for

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,330
you you should buy this one and then you

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:34,819
walk out of the shop and says no you

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,990
want to join this talk because you want

00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:39,050
to have a second opinion

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,690
that's is trying to establish trust you

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,520
want to have a second opinion on why

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:48,710
would you want to pick one product

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:53,090
instead of another product this is that

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:56,840
this is a mini tab conf which means I am

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,150
interested in Debian and I assume that

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,880
you everybody knows that what Debian is

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:06,710
I'm in love with Debian and I strongly

00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:09,469
believe that Debian is has some security

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,409
features has some safety measures built

00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:16,930
into how it's designed how we are

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:20,990
developing the system what I generally

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,150
suggest is that you install on machines

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,150
that can run Debian run Debian on the

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:29,449
machine so for an operating system the

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:33,020
job is simple for me I would say well

00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:35,960
run Debian wherever you can what I mean

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,169
by that is run Debian and only Debian

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,759
don't run Debian and then download the

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,660
Ubuntu packages that doesn't exist in

00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,090
Debian

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,100
reason they don't insist on Debian

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,530
that's because no one in Debian has

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,320
double check that it works for the

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:56,060
context of Debian so it doesn't it isn't

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,580
double check by Debian experts and don't

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,440
download the plugins that you can from

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,420
your web browser your web browser is a

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,770
window to the rest of the world so

00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,810
you're sure you can shoot yourself in

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,900
the foot you can you can ruin the

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,330
integrity of the Debian system but try

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,720
to avoid that so what I'm suggesting

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,630
what is to run the system that we ship

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,600
we are a thousand guys that try hard to

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:24,430
make a secure system and for the

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:28,100
computers that cannot run Debian like oh

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,920
like this one my phone this one cannot

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,560
run Debian not as it Nate as its main

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,580
Cup a computer system at least for these

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,810
computers my recommendation is to run a

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,930
system that is at least has someone that

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,110
passionately tries to fix all the box

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,250
and the system today that generally

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:56,510
tries to do that is a system called

00:07:51,250 --> 00:08:01,250
Linus OS that covers most of these zones

00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:05,330
you can you can buy today another system

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:08,140
is more free meaning that it is avoiding

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,750
more of the evil design stuff or

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:15,410
potentially evil design stuff which is

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,860
called replicant personally I don't use

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,980
replicant at the moment because yes it

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:26,780
tries to avoid or some some of the bad

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:28,940
stuff but it is a very low low very

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,440
powered system there's very few people

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,140
involved in the system and they can't

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,169
keep up with all the changes to software

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,990
so they don't provide updates very

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,510
frequently sadly I would love to be able

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,300
to run replicant and also have frequent

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,540
updates to the software but I cannot do

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,450
that if you are a geek and you have

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,540
spare time enough then you can compile

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,340
from sources based on replicant but it

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,900
takes a day or so to compile

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,340
system from my phone and I seen that

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,490
that means I only have six days a week

00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,200
to use an up-to-date system and I need

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,780
to spend the rest of the time to compile

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:11,510
the system so for the computer software

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,480
the distribution on your computer if it

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,910
can run Debian I advise to run baby on

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,240
on it if it cannot run Debian if it is a

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:29,450
phone my suggestion is to run Linux OS

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:57,080
on the machine so for what computer

00:09:29,450 --> 00:10:00,770
should you use Oh correct if I should

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,850
repeat for the for the video that there

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:07,010
is a project happening at the moment on

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:11,720
from the company purism to creates a

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:14,780
phone that can run the proper Debian

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,930
system or Debian like systems and yes

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,120
that's true and I was actually hired six

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,910
months ago and I'm really excited to

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,740
work with the purist company I don't

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:29,240
work directly on the phone parts on the

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,760
hardware I'm working on making APN

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,200
system removing the part of Debian that

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,450
free software foundation don't like so

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,370
that it is both free from this point of

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,410
view of Debian and also free from the

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,300
front of your Free Software Foundation

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,940
but yes it's correct there's a work in

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,230
progress it's very very exciting but it

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,480
also is a work in progress

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,580
there will be more than one year before

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,800
the phone exists physically in the world

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,100
we can hold it in our hands and even

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,220
when it exists mmm it might not be the

00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,070
kind of experience that you are used to

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,350
from an Android device it's it will

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,390
probably be a very very simple

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,950
experience that you have from these

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,750
films in the first run

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,250
things will of course radically change

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,610
when we have these phones when we have

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,550
something that can run debian from the

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,230
beginning then it will be a very

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,029
exciting world where we can do a lot of

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,209
other exciting stuff but it takes time

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:29,550
and I'm not only here talking about

00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:31,800
things that exist today so if you want

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,740
to then buy a piece of hardware that

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:40,550
goes good with your free software system

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,730
what hardware should you then use for

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,180
phones

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:48,300
well I suggest to buy the hardware that

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,630
can run free the replicant system the

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,700
most free system and the one that I have

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,579
found that is the newest that can still

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,649
run the replicant system is the one I

00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,029
have in my hand a samsung galaxy phone

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,190
you don't need to write these things

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:05,730
down at the end I will give you the link

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:10,800
for the web address for this slide for

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,870
these slides so um and for a home

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,490
computer a desktop computer for those of

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:19,920
us who still use that kind of creature I

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:24,510
would suggest to buy whatever you like

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:28,589
from the shops as long as you avoid the

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:31,649
worst nightmares which is nvidia and

00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:34,620
Broadcom things nvidia is typically the

00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:37,470
graphics card the cheaper graphics card

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,350
that still has big numbers on very

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,510
speedy powerful chips they protect

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,339
ability they are from Nvidia they have

00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,470
problems with free software they can

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,440
work well together collaborate well to

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,790
both free software developers and

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,820
Broadcom chips that is typically found

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,730
in Wi-Fi drivers and network drivers so

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,930
if you just steer free of these two then

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,300
you will pretty surprised that you will

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,910
only have the selection from half of

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:07,019
this shop that you enter into it's a lot

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,149
of them used with these chips but there

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,240
will be options that don't use these two

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:14,820
chips and I would generally say buy one

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,649
of those of course you are better off if

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,660
you then say look through the catalog

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:20,190
and then pick 15 items and then you go

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,690
to your best friend that is a computer

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,970
geek and say

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,480
between these 15 items which one is more

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,030
secure and why but if you're on your own

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,390
just avoid these two chips by whatever

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:37,680
if it's your a stationary old-style

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:42,650
computer or if you want to be fancy then

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:46,020
you can also buy a little tiny box they

00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:49,740
from a Bulgarian company called Olli Mac

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,830
or Linux your only Olympics when that

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:58,380
that creates some very cheap new

00:13:52,830 --> 00:14:00,930
computers called a line - so oh if you

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,260
want to buy a laptop then you're more in

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,780
problem in trouble a lot of them is

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,340
using Nvidia and Broadcom and another

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:16,710
problem a big problem of these is also

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:19,710
that I'm just I just realized now I'm

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:22,110
mixing up a little bit but what is what

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,480
I call secure in the desktop and laptops

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,040
so I'm more cautious with laptops

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,490
because it's laptops that I'm more

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,210
focused on there are other issues with

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:36,690
modern competes desktop computers - for

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:40,110
PCs the main issue the concern that I

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,010
would raise today is an issue that had

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,020
come up de la

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:48,510
since 2012 or thereabout with a

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:52,620
remote-control engine inside Intel and

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:55,350
AMD computers so I don't want to get too

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,520
technical here unless you have questions

00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:04,140
afterwards but the main issue of this is

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:06,720
that the computer is designed today all

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,700
of them can be remote controlled in

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,460
principle can be remote controlled from

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:17,010
outside most likely they won't be

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,810
because it's most likely the chips are

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,050
designed so that you actively have to

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:25,589
enable it you have to give your consent

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:29,370
most likely and most likely there are no

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:30,780
box that can be abused so that you can

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,380
they can be remote controlled without

00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,350
your consent

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,340
but there's a slight risk that they can

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,000
be abused

00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:41,010
so because of this risk if you are

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,440
interested in a secure computer a

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,380
trusted environment then you should try

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,740
to avoid the risk of being

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:52,740
remote-controlled and today for the

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:57,690
laptops there are very very few options

00:15:52,740 --> 00:16:01,680
for avoiding this one option is by an

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,450
specific older laptop that where they

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,400
where this is known to be able to be

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:12,180
disabled there's a laptop called Libre

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,880
boot T 400 I have a link for this at the

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,820
end of the slides so there's a laptop

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,320
called a libre boot T 400 which is I

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,400
think 5 or 6 years old

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:27,140
if not more people much into think pets

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,520
they must correct me here so it's a

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,010
reasonably fast computer but not the

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,470
fastest sub today and you can buy that

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,779
as an refurbished laptop where they

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,740
remove this remote communication

00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:45,510
capability if you want to buy powerful

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:48,900
hardware I don't think you would need

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:51,150
that as an average user really honestly

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,660
you think that you need a powerful

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,250
computer but most people really don't

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,980
but if you really need a powerful

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:03,960
computer then I know only of one option

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,490
today and to be fair I am paid by the

00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,640
company who produces these computers

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:13,589
since 6 months it's the the labrum

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,170
laptops from purism they are not cheap

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,890
to say it mildly but they are the only

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:23,550
ones that I am aware of at all in the

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:26,520
world that is a modern standard and have

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:34,100
not have crippled this ability to remote

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:38,210
control him the brand it's it's a libram

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,850
so the company is purism and and the the

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:44,960
the name of the brand is libram sole

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,960
EEPROM Libre machine

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:56,830
so right and then I also I put in anyway

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,870
I did I did put in if you are if you can

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,900
wait in a year then there will also be a

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,760
foam so that is the leap and five phone

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,100
that is better than what you can do

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,780
today and if you can if you are more

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,440
geeky person than I've also thrown in

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:24,790
some options of what more geeky things

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:27,700
can you do instead that there are more

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:30,610
options than this that has various

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:34,120
security features the Gullah phone is

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:37,170
not one of them I do not deliberately

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,600
include the Yola phone because they

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,520
first technically the first step I the

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,220
thing that I distinguish here is does it

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,640
run mainline Linux the Yola phone does

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:51,220
not run mainline Linux so I don't see

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
that as sensible phone to include in

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,980
that range

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,900
this one also does not run this one also

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,670
runs Atlantis kernel so what I'm saying

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,530
when I'm saying mainline Linux I mean

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,190
the Linux that Lino's toggles is

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,530
maintaining and the and Yala as far as I

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,780
know is not running the Linux that you

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,950
know Chavez is maintaining he's running

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,650
the kernel that he knows Chavez

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,090
maintained five years ago and then he

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,830
stopped maintaining that because he was

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,880
moving on and improving a lot of

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:24,040
functionality so all of the phones all

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,290
of them all of the millions of phones

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,040
running Android today they run on a

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:33,970
crappy shitty old version of Linux all

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,640
of them crappy shitty old and Yola

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,380
included correct me if you are if I'm

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,000
wrong here but I strongly believe that

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,180
that Jolla is also in this boat of

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,830
running crappy shitty old core and then

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,610
on top of that is maintaining the mnsure

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,610
but I think

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,130
yes so so among the crappy shitty old

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:59,930
cause the most resourceful of the

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,740
companies who are running the crappy

00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:06,560
shitty old cause they-they bet port they

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,380
cherry pick what they believe is the

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,500
relevant parts from current mainline

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,470
Linux and then the parts that they miss

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,990
all the parts that they decide is not

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:21,050
relevant for you to have they don't back

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,670
port in other words someone else decides

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,790
someone else than you and someone else

00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,710
then the experts of writing Linux they

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,320
decide what is relevant for you to have

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,600
in your phone and that is not secured by

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,290
my standards and it is by someone else's

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,790
technologies by your standards that's

00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,320
there's a lot of there's a lot of gray

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:42,260
areas here and I'm not saying that it's

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:50,360
total crap I only say that if the core

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:52,550
is total crap and it is well the issues

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,130
with the on the top of the stack but

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,840
they I'm trying to avoid the technical

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,280
details here I'm not

00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,690
you can shoot everything down the

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,330
problem here is there's nothing that is

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,430
perfect in this world the things that

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,390
I'm closest to being perfect at the

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:10,070
moment is things like this lime - piece

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,380
of hardware which is a little geeky but

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,900
I believe actually I could give a lot to

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,020
my mom and it will be running a year

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,130
later securely it can run plain Debian

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,870
and it runs the mainline do you know

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,630
little kernel but it is a little geeky

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,570
but the thing is that of that one is the

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,490
chip is not behaving well with free

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,520
licensing so all of them can be shut

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,500
down and the solution to that is ok we

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,320
should give up on computers because none

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:40,310
of it is completely free but none of us

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,040
has this is we're not at nirvana yet but

00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:45,789
I'm cutting my I'm setting drawing the

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:51,609
line a little different than you if you

00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:59,200
any line but there is a solution which

00:21:51,609 --> 00:22:01,869
is better than the iOS right sailfish

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,049
and Yolo is interesting some parts of it

00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:06,940
is interesting and the day we have the

00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:10,600
leap and phone and similar mainline

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,609
Linux phones we can reuse the good stuff

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,039
that they are using in their phones but

00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:16,899
their full tone today is by minus 10

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:28,629
that's not an interesting option I would

00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:30,539
not recommend it to my friends see do

00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:34,059
computers do you know them

00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:38,320
yes thank you it's unfair that I

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:41,019
mentioned one of the places I put up one

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,869
of them mentioning Libre booty 400 there

00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:45,759
are other companies then this one where

00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:48,580
you click the link it's this is blue not

00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:52,359
black if you click the link here you go

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:56,229
to a UK company called Ministry of

00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,580
freedom I think and there are other

00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:59,919
companies than these people who are

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:05,229
doing exactly the same as they do which

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:07,539
is I'm not sure but it looks more a

00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:09,549
little bit like like the libram like

00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:12,970
something very built so it's not a

00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:15,929
refurbished Lenovo computer or something

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,879
but I think it's they built this from

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:21,999
material they buy on the market and and

00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:24,389
put a brand on it and and this that's a

00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:27,999
German there's a German company who are

00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:31,389
testing computers to run Linux and there

00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:33,159
is a Spanish company testing their

00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:36,849
computers and running well with Linux

00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,580
and the KDE a community is endorsing the

00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:41,470
Spanish one and making a KDE branded

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,539
laptop and so this there's a there's a

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,340
couple in u.s. also there are three

00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,109
different companies I believe in the US

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,970
was also doing things that they are

00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:51,999
testing well with running with Linux in

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,009
general so yes there are options that

00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:57,200
are it's it's more refined than this

00:23:54,009 --> 00:24:00,370
that's correct but

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,310
the German company I'm quite sure

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:06,200
doesn't do what Libra is doing with

00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,590
having very modern computers and

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,150
ensuring that it cannot run the

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,890
management engine from Intel that is the

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,230
only company I'm aware of that can that

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,690
succeeds in crippling this remote

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,090
control machinery from modern computers

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,100
there's a range of different companies

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,750
what I've tried to say before is there's

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,970
a German company there's a UK company

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,580
there's an American company that but

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:36,040
it's a similar thing of ensuring no

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:39,110
remote control for the Lenovo X 400 and

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,960
nothing newer than that so if there's

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,490
anything newer than that it will be have

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,550
the risk of remote control from all of

00:24:43,490 --> 00:25:06,920
these companies as far as I have been

00:24:46,550 --> 00:25:10,190
able to find so yes could you repeat did

00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,580
you say when this purism Librium 5 will

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:16,070
be on the market there has been a

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,880
fundraising campaign to even start the

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:23,990
thing which succeeded a few weeks ago

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:27,020
and that means that now there's been the

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:29,540
start of hiring people and starting the

00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:33,910
design of the of the board and all these

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:36,920
things so in know no sooner than 1 year

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,840
the plan is I believe one year and three

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,670
months from now there will be a phone so

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,320
that is the plan and of course I

00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,900
shouldn't say more because I'm paid by

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,150
the company but we all know that it's

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:50,030
not always that companies deliver in

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:53,240
time so it might be a couple of months

00:25:50,030 --> 00:26:05,500
extra to really make it working so one

00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:05,500
and one and a half year so

00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:13,970
so now you know what computer you should

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,830
buy sandy'll you should buy a great

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,830
computer and you should run a great

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:22,220
computer system on it so what you should

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:26,990
also do is you should pass it around to

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:29,180
your friends and you should elect me for

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,010
government and then I can write into law

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,570
that we should all have the ability to

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:38,150
do these things now the point here is

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,520
what is the reason that we have this

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:47,300
very limited options

00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:49,160
is that we in reality skip buying the

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,030
sensible stuff we buy the cheaper and

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:56,690
more shiny stuff we are the reason we

00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:59,180
don't have more free options because in

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:04,550
modern society we don't vote for our

00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:07,430
leaders we shop for our leaders shop for

00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,380
whatever we shape Society so if we want

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,270
to change things it is painful to change

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:15,320
it because we need to stop shopping the

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:18,350
fun things because essentially what we

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,570
want is security and security is

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,420
whatever is boring it is what is not

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,430
exciting so if we want non exciting

00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,830
things we should stop shopping for the

00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,800
exciting things don't buy the laptop

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,600
with a fingerprint reader because the

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,010
fingerprint reader you don't

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,310
about what the fingerprint reader really

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,620
does and if you ask any are the experts

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,540
then they they funny enough don't

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,830
mention the fingerprint reader in any of

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,630
their reports about how you should

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,310
secure your life but you you could see

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,960
that it's cool you can see that it's

00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,970
shining right so you want to buy that

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,520
anyway but just just to try it out right

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,170
and that means that you skip buying the

00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,390
thing that can be removed that cannot be

00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:59,600
remote-controlled in order to have this

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:03,050
shiny thingy that really doesn't do much

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,940
and if you look closer then you can you

00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:07,070
saw the movies of how you can do take a

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,300
piece of tape and then you can copy the

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,040
if the fingerprint of someone else and

00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,360
and you can do exactly that on your

00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,810
fingerprint reader so you can test out

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,270
as a geek prove the theories that are

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,840
shown in the movies that you can do with

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,880
your fingerprint

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,560
but please buy it as a separate product

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,940
don't buy it as a ingrained into a

00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,220
laptop because you want to throw out the

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:34,940
moment you learn what this box is really

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:38,900
doing so another thing is that you just

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,640
listen to me for maybe 15 minutes about

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,120
this is what you should do this is the

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,950
solution this this is this is safe right

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,350
but I started out saying that you

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,370
shouldn't listen to people talking about

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,760
what is secure

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:57,040
you should you should you should figure

00:28:52,760 --> 00:29:00,020
out what is trustworthy and the thing is

00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:04,250
don't trust me on what I'm saying here

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,930
you should be inspired by me in how you

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,940
should think yourself when you go

00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,380
shopping or when you go ask your friends

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,520
there are geeky or claim that they are

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,830
geeky a claim that they know everything

00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,510
I claim that I know everything about

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,080
what you should shop so you should

00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:19,850
listen to me but I knew sure in the end

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,440
decide for your for yourself how do you

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,260
do that because you don't know you're

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,650
not an expert well you get a second

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,600
opinion a third opinion you google it so

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,220
I'm just giving you some suggestions on

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,790
what kind of things should you look for

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,400
I said some evil stuff like Nvidia and I

00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,840
said something about mainline Linux so

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,090
every time people say that oh it runs

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,060
Linux it runs Linux it's got to be good

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,960
right yeah it runs crappy old Linux is

00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,960
what I'm saying

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,280
you probably cannot Google for crappy

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,860
old windows I don't think that any of

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,900
them says yeah this one runs crappy only

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,330
knows but try and search if they have

00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,540
mentioned if they've remembered to

00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:01,670
mention mainline Linux and if you cannot

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,770
do that then then then check out when

00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,810
was this Linux last updated they

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,410
probably forgot to mention that in their

00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:12,680
sales papers so the thing is if it

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:15,470
doesn't say it isn't written then it was

00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,150
deliberate on their part except for

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,620
prism of course that was that was the

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,900
slippery snow better because they forgot

00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,690
to mention on their webpage if you go to

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,730
the purism webpage and you don't find

00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,380
anything about mainline Linux then

00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,360
please send an email to them and whine

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,890
about it and say that they are insecure

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,530
then they probably wake up then we

00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:37,470
and correct the webpage because yes the

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:40,020
Debian running on the Linux running on

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:42,480
may on the viewers and laptops its

00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,730
mainline Linux it is the Linux that was

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,130
a lot just released yesterday we can run

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:55,380
that the phone no phones can do that

00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:59,190
today a last thing that is maybe obvious

00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:04,080
to some here but that's the thing of how

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:08,059
do you how do you trust someone in one

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,920
of the reasons that I love Debian and

00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:13,130
just straight-out recommend everybody to

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,940
run Debian on their machines is that

00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:19,890
Debian is strongly active in what is

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,429
called the web of trust which means that

00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:26,670
we try to tie each other in in a in a

00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:28,679
closely mediate digital network so that

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:32,490
people can't escape from the errors they

00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,679
make all of us make errors but what we

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:37,020
do in Debian is that we can point

00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,640
fingers at those who make errors so that

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,590
they don't do it again and so that we

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,320
can correct the errors there's no

00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,820
there's no escaping what you do of

00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,850
errors so we try to work very

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:52,410
transparently and we try to work

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:54,420
responsibly not by paying for our

00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,820
employees and then firing people that

00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,660
don't behave properly we don't involve

00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,940
money in what

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,570
but what we do in Debian is that we say

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,610
that everybody has to sign in on what

00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,190
they do whatever they commit to do in

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,230
Debian they say they prove that they

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,470
have their name on it so I have my name

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,990
at stake whatever I do in Debian if I do

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,429
some foolish stuff then my colleagues in

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,190
Debian they can point fingers at me and

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:22,770
say well this was not this was not this

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,660
this was hilarious they can write a blog

00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,720
post about me and that is very hurtful

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,470
for me if anybody Debian says that I am

00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,230
stupid

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,900
that hurts so that's the kind of

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,820
guarantee that I can tell you that you

00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,770
can have from Debian so you have a

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,870
thousand people who are trying to hold

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,429
each other's up on their word and

00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,980
everybody in the URLs in the whole world

00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:45,660
can double check if they really did hold

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,070
each other up on the word because the

00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,549
we're transparent in this whole process

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,350
you probably won't ever do that yourself

00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:55,110
because it's it's geeky work to

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:58,260
double-check if people were cheating or

00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:00,960
not but the principle that we can do it

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:04,549
means that anybody in the world who

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,590
makes a university thesis about is

00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:10,710
Debian really transparent is Debian

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,750
really not cheating anywhere it will be

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,169
blown up in the media if anybody finds

00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,820
out

00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:19,650
proof that Debian is fake so that's the

00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,970
kind of of countermeasures you could

00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,000
have that's the kind of insurance you

00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:28,020
can get from a volunteer organizations

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,490
like Debian that we are worthy of your

00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:35,070
trust we offer you the ability to for

00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,350
you to trust us and similarly you can

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:40,289
try look at different organizations

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:44,309
different companies are they worthy of

00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:46,049
your trust the purism company is it

00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:48,240
worthy of your trust go to their web

00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:50,220
site go to the IRC channels and talk to

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,720
them whatever you can find about them if

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,159
you can't find anything that is in

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,929
itself a signal that well maybe you

00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,120
shouldn't trust them because they're not

00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:00,900
worthy of it they don't do enough for

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:06,059
you to have insurance in them to hold

00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:09,510
them up on their words huh oh I just

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:14,369
found out how long my fancy libram

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:17,629
laptop can last on a on a battery that's

00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:17,629
about six hours I think

00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,039
okay

00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:36,909
so don't trust anyone is saying things

00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:39,919
that secure or things are safe because

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:42,970
you need context to understand what they

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,529
are talking about and don't trust me and

00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,779
whatever I'm saying here don't only take

00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:52,119
an inspiration from it

00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:57,260
trust whatever you find trustworthy and

00:34:52,119 --> 00:35:00,079
then here's a link for the more concrete

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,329
information that I suggest so you can go

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,609
double-check and find more information I

00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:06,680
will also put in the I found the links

00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:10,099
for this mother for the the German a

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,140
laptop maker and the also the the

00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:18,440
Spanish one so I will put that into the

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:22,510
to the slides also that's what I had to

00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,510
offer any questions

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:38,930
so yes tourism is doing great work on

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:42,769
stripping the management in giant part

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:47,180
of the interviews but I'm wondering why

00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:52,400
are we sticking with those CPUs in the

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:55,219
first in in first why don't we use our

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,180
CPUs I think there might be other

00:35:55,219 --> 00:36:02,269
manufacturers or maybe over CPU art

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:04,999
architectures why why don't we change

00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:11,200
good question

00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:16,089
so purism specifically is aiming at

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:21,469
regular users that is not short on money

00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:24,680
so for their a what their aim they want

00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:26,779
very powerful computers and they want

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,549
people to not get disappointed with not

00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:30,650
being able to run steam or whatever they

00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:32,839
in the end wanted to use your computer

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,410
file even if it has nothing to do this

00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:36,739
euchre's it

00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:39,380
so for purism specifically they choose

00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:42,549
powerful mainline computers come on

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,009
computers and there are no other common

00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:48,079
computers powerful enough to compete

00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:52,699
with Intel and AMD that's the only two

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,859
options for this grade of computers that

00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:56,569
can squeeze into a laptop there are

00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:58,279
computers you can just double it up and

00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:59,420
you can even stack 15 armed computers

00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:00,949
and then maybe you could have enough

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,380
power but you cannot carry it and your

00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:06,259
in your in your in your wallet or your

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:10,759
bag so so that's specifically for purism

00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:13,479
they chose to have this aim so more

00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:16,640
generally yes there are exciting

00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:19,670
possibilities for alternative to Intel

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:24,339
and AMD so within Intel based computers

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:27,380
x86 or AMD 64 based the classical system

00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:30,559
there are other alternatives there via

00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:32,660
via computers and there's a few more

00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:37,249
that does

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,670
replicants of Intel based computers yes

00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:40,800
I think that they don't have the

00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,590
remote-control engine but also they are

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,750
not very powerful they are at the level

00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,730
that I have used via computers for my

00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,620
home servers in the past

00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,470
and I think that they are also safe

00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:56,030
they're more secure then Intel based

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:59,010
computers but today if you want

00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:02,670
something for a home server

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:05,310
I wouldn't my best suggestion is buy

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,770
this one for 50 euro instead of buying a

00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:11,520
 town simple or slower one of

00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,350
these for maybe 200 euros I don't know

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,420
the exact numbers I'm from Denmark so I

00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:21,000
don't I don't use euros myself so there

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,950
are other options today that are simpler

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,890
but then the most common of the

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,080
alternatives is armed computers and I

00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,610
already listed my best options for an

00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,800
armed computer which is open source

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:36,230
hardware ARM based computer that's the

00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,520
holy make slime - so and the other one

00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:44,220
the other option if you are into laptops

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,950
then geeks can buy an Olympics open

00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,230
source hardware do it yourself get a bag

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,550
of pieces and screw it together they

00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,350
just launched it one month ago and I

00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,270
bought what one of them super excited

00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:56,790
and I spent a week preparing for this

00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,160
talk not preparing for this talk parking

00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,380
this talk and preparing for having being

00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,220
able to show you all the terrace one

00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,110
running pure Debian and I failed so

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,660
that's why it was on page number two

00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,890
this this this is not ready for

00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,140
mainstream this is not ready for

00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,960
ordinary people this is a geeky product

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:20,360
still it was out one month ago so it's

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,360
not surprising it's it's not there yet

00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:33,210
there is also a end solution with risk

00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,210
[Music]

00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:39,930
Nova balls already existing and a few

00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:42,950
servers but the bottom line from the

00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,950
price point of view is

00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:54,580
the future is bright

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,820
no doubt the future because yes it is

00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:00,010
possible today to buy today and to

00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:03,640
yesterday was possible to buy a terrace

00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:07,359
one laptop and and risk five board

00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:11,109
without any box around it so yes in a

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,780
week let me a week from now you could

00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,970
build your own box around the board

00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,940
the bear board that you can buy today

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,800
and yesterday and then you would have to

00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,340
wait a year or two how long will you

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,850
estimate until we branch off a new

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:30,609
Debian architecture because the detail

00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,920
of the risk five super exciting hardware

00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:38,500
product risk five is the future

00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:44,470
hopefully maybe together with the DM the

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:58,890
the the new kernel on the herd yeah no

00:40:44,470 --> 00:41:03,100
sorry is it maybe one the risk five is

00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:06,270
exist today as proof of concepts chip it

00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:09,520
doesn't it doesn't exist today as

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:12,040
hardware platform with supported by a

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,190
free software reliable distribution

00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,930
there is no Debian distribution

00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,380
supported for the architecture for with

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,780
five there is an proof-of-concept

00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:25,210
experimental snapshot that is half a

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,930
year old and not updated regularly in

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,640
the MIT for so that it you can prove

00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,770
that yes you can boot the machine and

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,119
you can run stuff but this talk is about

00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:40,810
what is trustworthy not what is existing

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:43,359
so the chip has possibilities in a

00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:45,490
future where it is also supported by

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,869
trustworthy software at the moment you

00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,609
have trust when it's also a Debian and

00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:51,790
you have trust where the hardware risk

00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:54,600
five and they don't fit together because

00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:58,090
the risk five is only existing in I

00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,440
expect very very little quantity because

00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,450
it's a proof of concept at the moment

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,490
and then the bar camp

00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:06,280
might be bought by an evil bigger

00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:24,150
company from now so we have this other

00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:26,600
detail any other questions well then

00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:34,560
thanks a lot

00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:34,560
