today I'm most more importantly get you

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:11,340
lot to talk back as well about a Debian

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,650
website and the Debian wiki this is

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,880
explicitly above I do not want to be

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,190
talking here for more than about five

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,789
minutes I want to have a discussion with

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:25,680
people let's see how it goes so quick

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,470
agenda I have a couple of slides let's

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,769
go through status plans help needed oh

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,680
hell yes there is help needed and if

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,320
you've got any discussions and ideas yes

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,790
please talk to us if you're here or on

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,040
ion I see if you're not and we'll try

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,329
and you know we like questions please

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,809
take notes in gobby someone I will

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,340
endeavour to send out notes after this

00:00:50,809 --> 00:01:00,030
it may take a week of so so w in web

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,489
team i have commit access but i don't

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,860
pretend to be anything to have any great

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,950
power or control over the webste web

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:15,689
team does anybody else here have

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:17,430
anything more we still using CVS despite

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,890
the fact people have been talking for

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:25,170
what a decade or so about moving away

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,150
from it I would love it if we moved over

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,060
to get there's been discussion about

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,409
that several times over the years

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,579
there's been some pushback in that a

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,380
people are scared that it's going to be

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,600
a big repo and it's that's going to put

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,110
people off downloading it and working

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,409
with it

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,610
I don't believe that to be a major

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,899
problem at all personally but I'm not in

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,040
the situation I'm not one of those

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:55,200
people who might be put off clearly the

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,750
other thing is that the get workflow it

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,370
is claimed may put off some of the more

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,730
casual contributors

00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,410
I'm not equally not all that convinced

00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,560
that CVS is a wonderful tool for those

00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,180
people either but it's difficult to know

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,240
I don't tend to talk to these people

00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:27,730
very often I hope other people may have

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:31,660
more insight it's the mic on just so rod

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:36,540
has done a conversion of the website to

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:39,760
get but I'm not sure if it's updated or

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,220
that's totally not seeked with the well

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,090
yeah I mean how big was it at the time

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:48,370
do you know no idea okay

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,590
I mean my own personal thing is I used

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,810
to be the CVS maintainer it's horrible I

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:56,080
got away from it and that made me very

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,410
happy I haven't had to do CVS for

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,380
anything else in five years every time

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,190
that I come across doing stuff in for

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,840
the Debian website

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm believe me I don't do much is

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,510
typically tweaking pages to do with CDs

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,120
all of my finger memory has gone away

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,459
and end up havin to talk having to fight

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,800
with it so the biggest problem with the

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:21,880
conversion ticket is that with the

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:26,620
current translation system relies on the

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:31,290
CVS ID numbers Oh God

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:35,920
CVS revision Elvis right you'd have to

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,830
switch to get to midnight days against I

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,080
guess so of course they're not going to

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,310
be I mean of course I've seen this in

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,260
other situations they're not

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,570
monotonically increasing so it's not as

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,660
easy to talk to work with yes and the

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,480
other thing is that there's for some

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,820
pages there's a chain of translation the

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,860
original might be in Polish and then an

00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,810
English version gets translated and then

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,709
that gets translated to German and

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:05,650
Japanese and whatnot yeah so yeah it

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,620
seems a bit complicated hmm and so we'd

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,590
probably have to invent a different way

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,989
of doing that

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:18,690
different works like yes probably not

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:23,550
involving communities yeah yeah that's

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:26,580
right one thing that could help with

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:31,740
that is converting to something that we

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,930
can do normal get text files no not sure

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:39,960
about if that's possible with W about

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,680
anyone I don't see why no but I we don't

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,260
have

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,250
Jonas here unfortunately so me

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,040
anything else people would like to talk

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,860
about about the website stuff you know

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,120
sorry that's my pet peeve out the way

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:58,320
the reason I put did the Boff here

00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,500
together for the two groups is to not

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,850
just take up too much time but I guess

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,800
everything's perfect cause otherwise

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:12,930
people more people will be here right

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:19,229
you know torches and pitchforks is

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:21,390
anyone on IRC watching interested there

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,890
are a few people are nicely but they're

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,350
not saying anything fine

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:29,669
I guess we'll move on this could be a

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,890
short off so the wiki which is the main

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:37,190
thing that I'm interested in will be

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:41,070
honest Paul and I are the two active

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:44,700
wiki maintainer x' in terms of we're men

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,500
we have shall access on to the wiki

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,780
server and we can do everything on it

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:54,180
just about several other people have

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,039
super user access within Moines itself

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,870
which means they can do things like set

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:04,410
a Ciel's they can go and delete spam

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:07,560
that kind of thing easily more support

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:10,289
more help is always useful believe me

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,060
like every team we have many many other

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,039
things that we want to do if only we

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,419
have more time to do it and the

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:20,970
individual people obviously doing all

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:22,470
the tasks too but fine I did a check

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,250
last night

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,320
and we have currently have 12,000 203

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,320
pages in the wiki of course we probably

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,040
have a couple more since then

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:38,850
that's a scary number it really is most

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:43,740
of them are out of date this does not

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,930
count spam pages there are quite a lot

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,170
more pages though did exist but have

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,460
been deleted since this is system info

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,210
so it only checks things that are

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,370
currently valid the number that scared

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,350
me even more was a claim was the system

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,290
seemed to tell me we've got 12 and a

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,600
half thousand registered user accounts

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:06,920
now we did have about three and a half

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,620
thousand four thousand more spammers

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,380
which have been disabled that number

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,480
seems very high but I couldn't find

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,100
anything that told me that did I counted

00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:24,270
it wrong we're currently running

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:27,330
Moin Moin we're on a mostly clean

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:30,240
version one point 9.4 we have a few

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:34,200
patches that mostly that I've come up

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,700
with for helping with spam we're about

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,120
to move to one point nine point seven

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,870
probably today again still with a couple

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,000
of local patches I'm going to jinx

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:49,140
things and say I think we solved the

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
spam problem three years ago when I

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,790
really started getting involved with a

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,110
wiki stuff we had a horrendous problem

00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:02,160
of people just posting all kinds of crap

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,460
all over the working like they do we've

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,060
gone through a whole slew of different

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:12,390
approaches to stopping spam the main one

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:17,580
is you must now be a registered user to

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:19,560
be able to edit pages at all and to

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,140
create a user account these days

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,060
shockingly you've got to be able to

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,729
register by register with an email

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,130
address still something that's missing

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,990
in mine the patch and I have to add this

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,050
is something I need I'm hoping to get

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,710
pushed up again this week I've been

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:40,440
talking with upstream

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:42,390
even though even forcing people to have

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,250
working email of course doesn't stop the

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:51,020
spammers you'd be amazed how many we get

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,790
still are still trying to get through

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,089
the second part of the spam stuff is

00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:00,660
basically I've come up with a big set of

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,230
heuristics and then coded them in a Perl

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,170
script

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,350
so whenever anybody tries to sign up for

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,210
an account in the Debian wiki we have a

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,730
script that basically has historical

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,339
knowledge of what looks good what looks

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,990
bad it's not quite Bayesian but it's

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:20,100
approaching it these days

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,170
so as a rule of thumb if you try and

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,330
sign up for Debian wiki account and

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,600
you're coming from hotmail it's not

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:31,290
going to work because for a first

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,120
approximation 99.99999 percent of

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,470
hotmail signups are spammers and don't

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,690
get me wrong it's not just hotmail if

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,240
you're using a gmail address it's

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,029
unlikely that you will be able to create

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,290
an account straight away unless you all

00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:51,959
you look particularly non spammy

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:55,170
all of the free email providers are too

00:09:51,959 --> 00:10:02,220
easy for spammers to sign up with Paul

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:04,589
we have we have comments oh yes do you

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,810
have to be a registered Debian developer

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,420
to get a Debian wiki user account no not

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,140
at all just cuz I'm a new oh yeah

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:20,970
absolutely yes and we have a question in

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:25,440
the back as well I'm new to WN could you

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,910
explain to me how you're making sure

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:36,960
that the user looks

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:39,780
spammy sure a typical spammer I'll show

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,880
you in a moment I've got a demo of the

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,270
system of the system I can't use to look

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,210
at it

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,340
a typical spammer signup will have

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,230
something some random sequence of alpha

00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,050
numerics a hotmail.com for an email

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:56,550
address for the user account name will

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:59,100
have four or five digits or capital

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:02,040
letters as an email address and so as a

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:06,390
user account with no overlap between the

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:12,990
two they will be coming from as often as

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:15,630
not a random Chinese mobile IP all the

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,700
becoming from a known spam Haven I'll

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,240
list a few of those in a moment as

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,120
examples if you're coming from one of

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,860
those then the the the anti-spam script

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,560
will basically it gives them all scores

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,470
and if your score is above quite a low

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,590
number your total score then you just

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,400
get told no if you try to come from the

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:41,640
same ip address to quickly say in less

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,610
than two or three days and you try three

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,320
or four times with again obviously

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,390
ridiculously spammy things we blacklist

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,270
the IP and say sorry that's it you're

00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:54,330
not getting in blacklisting the IP isn't

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,340
just a you can't sign up it's a well

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,710
you're clearly not interested in Debian

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:03,540
we blacklist it you don't get to see the

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:06,270
Debian wiki anymore going beyond that if

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,110
there are obvious patterns and we see it

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,140
all the time

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,840
were a whole slew of addresses from the

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,780
same network provider all in the space

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,760
of one overnight session we've seen some

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,220
say a couple of hundred attempts from a

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,200
loads of things in the same slash 24

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:28,460
something we will just block the slash

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,460
24 if I

00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,769
let's see if I can make this fit

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,660
basically I have almost a console

00:12:52,510 --> 00:13:00,240
running on the wiki and I'm not on the

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,240
network of course am i I bear with me

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,970
yep

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:21,970
we've tried using captures in the past

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:27,490
for a short period on a mean short like

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:30,550
a few weeks it helped so are so many

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:34,030
problems with using especially we

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:40,180
capture blind and partially sighted

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:42,160
users are screwed over versions privacy

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,650
violations there are so many problems

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,150
with it to be honest the biggest problem

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:51,750
is it doesn't work we actually found it

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:55,300
didn't help for more than a few weeks

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,580
the spammers have already solved that we

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,090
captured problem oh that their problem

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,340
with it they either have systems that

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,980
manage it automatically or for pennies

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,990
they get people out people in the third

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,660
world or whatever to just sign up and do

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,150
them for them so the fact that were what

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,930
was he seeing people coming from hotmail

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,670
Gmail Yahoo were you've already got two

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,220
who've done a CAPTCHA to get the email

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,050
address in the first place means that

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,080
well in people have solved this problem

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,210
we can slow them down very small amount

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,400
but unfortunately it just had no effect

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,020
and it did legitimately annoy a number

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,160
of people who wanted to be contributors

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,990
so again I added a recapture patch for

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,090
Moyne which is gone which I'm pushing

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,130
upstream in case other people want it

00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:46,780
because I wrote it and then turned it

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:50,830
off so Steve on that front

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:54,370
I talked to entry and he said he sent

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:56,590
your script so that we can whitelist or

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,660
exit nodes yes

00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,430
and it would be great to integrate that

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,180
at some point that would be lovely

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,340
so that we don't burn people who like to

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,100
be anonymous

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,930
yeah and again that's something I'll

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,390
come back to in a moment if you have a

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,850
look I have a simple screen session

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,420
that's running on wiki Debian dog I hope

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:22,360
it's I don't know how visible that is

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:27,370
yeah and then it's basically gonna go

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,410
away is that more readable that's about

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,390
as big as I can do you will see

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,270
basically I have something I have a

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,360
monitor script that ones and just for my

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,850
information basically goes every couple

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,820
of minutes it checks through the last so

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,700
many days worth of accounts are not

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,290
attempts I've got something that will

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,020
give me the IP address that something

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,630
came from a court of course it's got no

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,700
reverse DNS this is what at the top we

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,890
have as I was saying earlier we have a

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,990
random looking attempts so with this

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,330
person has tried to sign up twice or

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,270
this IP address has tried to sign up

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:09,460
twice with two entirely arbitrary

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:12,310
looking stupid names with to all other

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:18,910
you know also entirely stupid locking

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:23,740
random Hotmail accounts they're not

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:26,530
getting in so I've denied we've denied

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,320
both of those the average score that

00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:32,080
we've given them is 29 just based on the

00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,900
information that that's given us a score

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,480
29 is much more than the threshold of 10

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,990
they're not getting in it's as simple as

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,780
that

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,330
they've only attempted twice if this

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,430
same ip address had tried a third one

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,459
with yet another username and yet

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,700
another email address the the system

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:53,380
will actually say you're clearly

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:58,950
irredeemably a spammer go away and we'll

00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:03,610
block the IP address the next one down

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:05,050
looks maybe more believable in that the

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,839
email addresses are at least vaguely

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,659
consistent but still Yandex

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,689
is a well-known Russian search engine

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:15,970
and free email provider and again

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,370
they've got stupid names it's not a

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:21,730
guarantee of spam none of this is it a

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:24,220
lot of it comes down to judgment but I'm

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,650
not about to block them if they try

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,059
again with an average score 28 and

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:34,210
higher again forget plot yesterday I

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:37,000
wanted to sign up for the wiki yes to

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:42,880
edit or the wine and cheese party thing

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,399
and I have a live in account simply

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,470
because it was easy for me to get that

00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:50,830
handle and I do not receive a

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,990
confirmation email so how do you deal

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,000
with people who are genuine but still

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,080
have emails coming in from life is a

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,620
very good question

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,169
when you try to sign up if you have been

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,720
blocked you actually see it's not as

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:08,559
obvious as it should be I know I know

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,690
that this is a problem why after you do

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,580
the register account you will actually

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,429
you should be told at the very top of

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:19,809
the next page in a banner sorry there

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:21,970
was an error if a tower persists and it

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:25,390
will give you an error code the error

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:29,169
code is purely and simply it's the

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,990
number 900 with your spam possibility

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:34,240
score added to it so if you if you get

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,520
an error code saying our nine one four

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,740
please try again if this continues mail

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,490
Debian where we were at lists not

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,110
everything org

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,210
then that's what what is meant to do

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,100
it's not perfect and for people who

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,740
don't speak English and we have quite a

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,110
number of those obviously it's hot it's

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,350
not great it's the best thing we can do

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:56,679
for false positives if you mail Debian

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,080
lower or wiki at Debian org and say oh

00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,179
you know I've tried to get in and I've

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,179
got this error message

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,830
PABs oh I we do it we do it every day we

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:07,299
can whitelist the email address and then

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:12,070
the next time you try and sign up it

00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:14,020
will let you in I don't want to spend I

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:19,480
spent too much too long on this already

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,840
because frankly spam is horrible I hate

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,639
it

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:28,719
I'd like I'd actually and

00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:31,289
kidding see it as a capital crime so but

00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:34,029
the point of the anti-spam stuff isn't

00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:35,769
the point at the point of a Boff is not

00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:38,049
the point of the wiki the point of the

00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:39,339
wiki is the content and that's that's

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:42,399
why we want to get short of the crap

00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:45,549
perhaps we have a couple of comments

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:48,339
from the gobby-o yes

00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:54,039
Debian deserves and arches or gentoos

00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:55,869
grade wiki yeah there's an idea to

00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:00,129
freeze the wiki per release and

00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:03,579
copy-on-write to the new version I've

00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:06,159
added an alternative idea to that to add

00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:09,039
some macros allowing pages to know what

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,070
the current releases and show the stable

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:16,269
release that's pretty easy yeah you know

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:18,249
now I've done a couple of things so that

00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:21,869
you can show them at night the name of

00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:24,369
the current stable shot release um and

00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:28,570
probably not that hard to extend that

00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:31,419
yeah I love something like that yeah our

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:35,289
wiki is is very large we have a huge

00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:37,029
amount of data like any wiki out there

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:40,389
on the net probably half of it is

00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,739
outdated or crap I don't know I wish

00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:45,369
that was an exaggeration but it's

00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:48,639
probably an under estimate the Gen 2

00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:51,489
wiki was was great as I understand and

00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:53,229
then they then they moved site decided

00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:55,239
that they wanted to start again and it

00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:57,789
never quite happened you know a lot of

00:20:55,239 --> 00:21:00,339
the content just never reappeared the

00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,409
arch wiki is absolutely awesome they've

00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:05,289
got a great community of people who keep

00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:07,659
on posting vast amounts of really good

00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:08,859
documentation some of it is up specific

00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:12,190
obviously and doesn't necessarily

00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:13,839
translate but half the time if I go

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,999
looking for you know to solve a problem

00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,249
you know I've got a laptop configuration

00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:20,499
issue or whatever I do a search and the

00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:22,389
arch wiki is at the top with not only

00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:26,129
good content but good links as to were

00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:26,129
to find more information yes it's great

00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:31,749
the Debian wiki is also great in some

00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:34,119
respects but it often comes up in in

00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,170
good searches unfortunately quite often

00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,330
with the same

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,010
dated information that I know because I

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,810
wrote it a few years ago that kind of

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:49,660
thing you know hell the Internet's like

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:51,940
that I haven't no not yet I know they're

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:56,500
using MediaWiki or something that looks

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,750
very like MediaWiki one of the issues

00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,970
with the different wiki engines is they

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,620
all have very very different spam setups

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:07,390
and very different spam solutions

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,760
Maureen is very much our preferred setup

00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,380
we have this something that have you

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,540
know happens every few every couple of

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,100
years we have the buff like this people

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,360
ask about wall should we use a different

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:22,120
wiki engine and the answer is possibly

00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,680
but who's going to do it and the big

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,500
problem with switching wiki engines is

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,000
then move migrating content or not and

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:33,430
then you end up with an empty wiki and

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,200
nobody uses it so sorry so if someone

00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,930
was interested in doing at least a test

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,700
case of MediaWiki migration hmm that

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,500
would I just asked this in the IRC but

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,170
that would require having like a you

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,630
know an actual like copy of the medium

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,240
Suki obviously the github that you or

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:52,540
they get that you can get from the

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,220
team's /jv is just the scripts is there

00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,620
a way to get a copy of the entire wiki

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,540
we can happily give you at a table or

00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,770
dump of the entire wiki we have done to

00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,430
a couple of people in the last few years

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,430
yes

00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,520
in addition I wrote a patch for Moyne so

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,550
that we can have a daily generated

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:16,780
offline copy in HTML format for people

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:19,480
who are in remote locations on orede the

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:22,240
Debian wiki unfortunately that hasn't

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,060
seen much traction upstream as Dave do

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,240
you have any way to like get people to

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:31,780
review my patch or no in review in a few

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,700
times and I'm absent my not stream all

00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,460
very helpful Thomas in particular is

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,560
really cool like a lot of us is

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,420
overworked best thing to do with the

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,180
Moines people to be honest is talk to

00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,250
them on IRC and push the pageant into

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,310
the upstream Moines wiki as far as a

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,450
patch review

00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:52,660
I mean I've done both of those shop pink

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,460
again more pink again they get busy

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,610
again they don't tend to do that much by

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:02,060
email it tends to be IRC or wiki itself

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,830
I mean Thomas is good enough that to be

00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,860
honest he's interested in the patches

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:10,460
that we that we have for you know for

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:13,670
Moines 1-9 for the recapture and the

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,680
mail verification and I've just been too

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,240
rubbish at refactoring Mirman dealing

00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,080
with his review comments which are likes

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:24,040
at least six months old possibly twelve

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,200
again it's on my list to do this week

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,390
other things that we do how and again

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,640
again a wiki is all about the content

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:34,070
forget you know the engine is frankly

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,490
irrelevant in the long run the main

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,760
thing that you need is good content and

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:45,920
good content of course is correct

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:50,360
up-to-date and maintained I do have the

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,730
first cut of a of a script that we'll

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,100
walk through a Moines and we'll go

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,800
looking for pages that are out of date

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,440
and so we can actually we could start

00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,050
maybe using it pick out the users who

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,840
who have contributed to pages put

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,840
previously and say after six months if

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,310
pages are tagged appropriately say you

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,670
suggested that this page you need

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,580
reviewing every six months please have

00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,660
been a please check and update it

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,210
because I think that's a useful thing

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,040
and I've never seen any wicked do that

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,650
I'm not to say if I played with every

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,830
working on the planet no there's far too

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,270
many clearly but I think that will be

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,620
useful thing to have I just haven't

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:35,420
rolled it out and really tested it yet

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,390
the there are issues of course that

00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:41,240
people doing trivial spelling tweaks of

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,310
course will we set the counter equally

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,350
the people doing the trivial spelling

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,300
tweets will then be the last people who

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,070
touched a page so well that they will

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,040
then get pestered about the content and

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,720
say you're clearly the expert about you

00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,270
know the details of the kernel driver

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,830
for this USB webcam please tell us more

00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,400
about it you know please check it's

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,440
correct

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,910
when all I've done is they've added a

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,309
link to the Russian translation or

00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:07,600
something it's not perfect but I think

00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,600
it'll be a good start

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:22,880
yes it is the numbers you know how many

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:23,600
people use it approximately zero hello

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
yeah

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,860
what about like using templates if we

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:32,690
explored that like basically bootstrap

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:35,059
new pages with templates for comment so

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:39,650
boy does have a template future and yeah

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:43,550
a bunch of pages or to use it so there's

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:44,990
like 20 or 30 templates already yeah

00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,720
depends on what kind of page you want a

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,340
crew yeah there's a certain thing say

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,190
set announcing that you're going to

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,600
display exactly or whatever we have a

00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,100
really good template for that already

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,690
that so you don't need to fill in all

00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:02,000
the details yourself you can just fill

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:04,370
in and it generates the rest again it

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,429
comes down to people using it and people

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,050
maintaining those if you have ideas for

00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:21,410
things you think we're missing please

00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:27,500
chat that's about it for what I had to

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:31,250
talk about really we are always looking

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:34,910
for more people to help as I said as

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:38,120
especially with the bugs especially like

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:42,910
they're kind of piling up and yeah I've

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,910
been looked at oh yes

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:52,179
the ways of wicked Ebina org BTS

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:55,300
category and yeah we're not very good at

00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,950
tracking bugs there necessarily we do

00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,860
see them honest

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:02,950
oh we can mention some of the special

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:09,340
features that we have on Debian wiki go

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:11,320
ahead you want to come on so one of the

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,179
things is that when you add a link to

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,309
the Debian bug tracker we have some

00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:16,480
JavaScript to go and look up the status

00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:19,360
of the bargain

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,240
also the CSS on the page so that it's

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,920
more obvious what statuses and then you

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,840
can hover over it and see the title and

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,540
all that sort of stuff

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,570
also the wiki looks up daily what they

00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,270
current Debian releases and then you can

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,179
say what's the code name for the stable

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:40,600
release and there's a macro for that and

00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:45,309
there's another one for release dates

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:50,380
and for version numbers there's one more

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:53,950
macro for linking to message IDs so

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:57,220
we'll just link to the Debian lists URL

00:28:53,950 --> 00:29:00,910
for the message ID yeah there's also I

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,590
mean there's a a convention for if

00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:05,020
you're working on stuff in the wiki and

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,240
you want it to stay around because it's

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:11,530
linked else worth there is also the

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,540
category permalink which we use to make

00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,309
sure that say especially later when if

00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,990
people have got of we've mailed out

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:18,580
press releases and stuff that link to

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,620
things in the wiki that those pages

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,480
don't go away when people are finding

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:28,600
them in the archives later that kind of

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:30,910
thing so one suggestion from IRC is that

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,330
a couple of people are suggesting they

00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:36,370
could do a dub dub dub slash wiki bug

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,740
squash and partly party remotely at some

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,290
point to try and get through some bugs

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:46,660
and things like that so that would be

00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:50,140
cool though is there is going to be a

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,790
bit of a step change coming of course

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,620
and I should have mentioned it earlier

00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,160
and it's just corroded you remembered

00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:00,450
one thing that we don't have yet

00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,490
for the wiki is single sign-on so if

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:07,230
you're a Debian developer or an alley

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:09,750
EFI user or or anyone any other random

00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:13,320
person everybody at the moment has their

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:18,330
own separate wiki account frankly that's

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:21,060
crap and single sign-on is mostly

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:25,770
working it's still in flux for a lot of

00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:28,080
for some of the Debian web space we're

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,540
planning on locking into single sign-on

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,640
real soon now we have been for a while

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,610
the only reason it hasn't happened yet

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,410
is down to manpower and other people

00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:41,850
doing other sites first with a single

00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:47,300
sign-on so if you have a debian wiki

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:49,620
account and you are and you're a DD then

00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,330
expect at some point in the near ish

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:56,250
future you'll probably get an email to

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:57,720
say stop using that account and or we

00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,690
will somehow find a way to link that

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,490
account to the single sign-on system

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,230
it's a bit in flux at the moment and

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:07,440
that's exactly something that would work

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:18,510
very well at at a bit at a sprint or a

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:21,120
BSP type setup on another topic I'm not

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:24,090
sure if anyone here's has other

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,860
languages that they can speak and write

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:31,170
but the wiki it is possible to to do

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,170
translations and you keep the way it's

00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:35,850
currently set up as you do you add the

00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:39,900
language code to the start of the page

00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:41,550
name with a slash after it that's not

00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:48,840
the best way to do it and it'd be great

00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:50,610
if we had a different way maybe with get

00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,490
text files or something hmm

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:56,640
but it'd be great if someone could

00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:59,010
research that if you're interested yeah

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,230
certain of the system pages in Moyne

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:04,530
because this is provided by mine will

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:07,389
automatically we direct you to the

00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:09,129
appropriate page say if you log in and

00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:10,719
your machine is set up and it work and

00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:13,419
recognize your browser says it prefers

00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:15,729
French you won't get sent to front page

00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:17,079
you'll get you'll go to the French

00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:18,519
equivalent don't know why I picked

00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,779
French because that's the 1aqaq I can

00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,909
never remember the front page

00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:26,739
translation what for example you know

00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,359
I've tested this myself it's it's

00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:29,859
maddening because once you've told your

00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,839
browser it knows about all the languages

00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:33,820
trying to turn that turn that off again

00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,499
never seem to work for me and then I

00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,289
spend the next day trying struggling to

00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:39,969
eat Dutch or something it's can you I

00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:45,459
speak a little bit about the performance

00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:48,849
and infrastructure of the wiki sure the

00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:53,440
wiki itself we used to run on dedicated

00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:57,789
hardware that frankly was was a cast-off

00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:01,089
from from other uses over time as we

00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:04,359
started getting more and more page views

00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:05,919
I the thing I should have done as well

00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,950
will actually go and get the grab the

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,959
stats for that if we realize that

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:14,729
actually it wasn't gonna work that well

00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:19,659
we've since moved over to a dedicated VM

00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:21,969
or provided by D s amd64 with huge

00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:25,779
amounts of memory so basically it runs

00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:32,409
Oh something silly like first 1632

00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:36,070
threads of WSGI running Moyne it seems

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:38,649
to work okay we have found we were we

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:42,999
are one of the biggest Moines using

00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:45,009
sites on the planet we did find that we

00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:48,399
had a major issue there was a major

00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:51,190
performance problem with page saves not

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,649
that long ago so you could happily read

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,709
the wiki pages but saving something

00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:58,149
could take literally a couple of minutes

00:33:55,709 --> 00:34:00,309
and that would turned out to be it was a

00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:03,389
scalability it was a design flaw in the

00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:07,570
way that more notifications are done

00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:11,139
when you go to save a page there isn't a

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:15,639
link from that page to each of the users

00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:17,649
who is known to have to be wanting to

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,649
watch it to get notified when it changes

00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:21,470
so instead it was walking through the

00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:23,540
12th

00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:28,310
user accounts looking in every single

00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:30,940
user password file to see does this

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:35,540
person want notifying about this page

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:38,929
that doesn't scale very well so there

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:41,690
was a patch already that the gnome wiki

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,369
people had come up with I tweaked it

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,859
slightly we've reviewed it backwards or

00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,159
forwards a bit I think it's actually

00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:50,690
gone into Moines for one nine eight

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,899
which is do release due to be released

00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:55,580
soon and then they went down from like

00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:59,270
literally a couple of minutes to maybe

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,859
two or three seconds which is fine a lot

00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,320
of people may not have noticed it book

00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:07,460
if you went to a bug squashing party and

00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,980
that the convention is that at a BSP you

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,900
will fill in details about all the bugs

00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,880
that you fix so you say you've got you

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,099
know competition if you've got BSP in

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,900
two locations or you can just point

00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:20,390
people at its later and say yay look

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,609
what we did and if you've got 12 people

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,560
around around a table all of them

00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:29,450
working on bugs and wanting to update

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:31,670
their list by god that was painful so I

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,050
got shattered that's a lot at a BSP and

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:41,930
that was what prompted me to go and fix

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:45,470
it so I'm not aware of any other major

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:48,339
performance hub issues at the moment we

00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:51,290
did have a fairly well-publicized

00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:53,750
security breach a few years ago which

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:57,200
was due to a bug upstream in one of the

00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:00,230
drawing plugins and that was fixed and I

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,020
caused reset one of the flip sides of

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,810
that one of the downsides was many many

00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,940
of our older accounts were from were set

00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,190
up by people who had never put in email

00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,470
addresses because he didn't have to when

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,270
they first signed up so a lot of those

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,460
people we had to of course reset all the

00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:19,070
accounts disabled you know disable all

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,780
of them force people to to do user

00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:23,150
account check you know password changes

00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:27,170
for those people who didn't have working

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:29,450
email there is no way of doing an

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,640
automatic password reset through Moyne

00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,170
because it sends you an email so if

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,450
you're one of those people and you

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:41,000
couldn't log in anymore sorry

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:44,210
to us bet that security halt and attack

00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,880
was that we adjusted the configuration

00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,920
of Sydney hours so that Iran as a

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,700
different user and they can't modify the

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,160
phone

00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,920
exactly yeah preview the default setup

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,380
of Moines is not very pretty in terms of

00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,010
security it's a it's it's simple it

00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,130
works

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:03,380
but it it does end up with all of the

00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:06,200
data and potentially a lot of the Moines

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,720
code itself owned by the same user we've

00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,410
explicitly set up privilege separation

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,690
for the Debian wiki to get around that

00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:17,000
and we worked hard worked with the DSA

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,250
folks for quite a while to get that

00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,710
working and they were awesome about it

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,440
and we it was basically it was just over

00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:26,350
Christmas that year and Wiesel ended up

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,310
basically spending a lot of time

00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,740
overnight if I remember correctly

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:33,380
installing a new machine we migrated all

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:38,090
the pages it was horrible but hey

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:39,890
sometimes it happens so I've been

00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:50,120
willing for too much in here please does

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:52,730
anybody else have any think I've got a

00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:57,610
question which is about the website yeah

00:37:52,730 --> 00:38:02,450
it's a good topic it's time developer

00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:05,780
commits a change on the website you each

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:13,190
have their is for well with the script

00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:16,090
scrum to to repeal to why not just each

00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,090
commit Frank Zappa

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:26,539
I think Neil has an answer for that so

00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:28,700
when I update update bits of the website

00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:30,769
for the press releases just updating the

00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:35,359
news section where all the press

00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:39,529
releases go takes about 10 minutes or so

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:41,720
so basically it's just huge I mean the

00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:45,910
actual size of the site to generate it

00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:52,249
from wml and all the languages we have

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:54,650
it's about a 540 megabyte repository so

00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:56,900
it's basically the time just to generate

00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:00,230
all that HTML it's sort the issue there

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:03,859
yeah four pages where we know that they

00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:05,569
shouldn't be affecting very much it is

00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:08,089
as I understand that it is possible to

00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:10,910
just rebuild small bits of the website

00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:13,339
but it's always potentially risky the

00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,230
way that wml lets you cross link things

00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:17,539
and you know essentially hash include'

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,849
bits and pieces and use macros all over

00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:22,329
the place and that's what it boils down

00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:24,739
to yeah it's not pretty it's not great

00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm not aware of really of a better

00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:49,339
solution I think we are just about done

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:51,619
so oh no or more currently it's vcvs yes

00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:54,200
if I understand this because there is a

00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:56,269
hook which is used for translation or

00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:01,339
something like that yeah

00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:05,319
is it possible to to use more get texts

00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:07,789
and profiles to fix some of this wrong

00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:11,480
it was some discussion on when I say

00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:14,930
about this apparently that pi/4 eye

00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,569
supports wll so we could possibly do

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,819
that and at the moment there are some

00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:22,700
parts of the website that I usually get

00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:26,869
text but not the whole thing and so

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:29,680
there would have to be a conversion that

00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:31,780
could be totally been held

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,160
I would think yeah but I'm not totally

00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,810
sure yeah

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,730
the biggest problem with I mean with a

00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,500
lot of the ideas that people are spoken

00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:41,530
about I mean like to get migration and

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,360
whatever is we're struggling to find the

00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,160
people with the band you know the people

00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:51,060
bandwidth to get through a lot of this

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:54,070
to more volunteers needed or as always

00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,650
and if you have any questions about the

00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:59,080
website or the wiki Steve and I here

00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,710
we're both here all week yeah absolutely

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,070
yeah

00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:04,450
Cole asked us yeah and we're both on the

00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,700
best list and of course I should have

00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:09,970
put this down well didn't debian where

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:13,330
we were at least dr. bender org or wiki

00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:15,370
Adobe not org is the best place to get

00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:18,570
in touch with not just Oz but with all

00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:22,300
the other people involved as well and

00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:25,380
what thanks for coming hopefully that

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,380
was inch that was useful

00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,840
