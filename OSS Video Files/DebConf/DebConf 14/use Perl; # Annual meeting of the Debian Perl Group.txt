so yeah it's one unit sir level on my

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,179
clock sir it's the best maybe that's why

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,270
I'm late for all the talks okay so

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,480
welcome everybody I'm totally happy to

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,260
see so many people here more than I

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,309
expected so that would be a rather small

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:34,829
round cool so yeah we've written up some

00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:40,079

Kobe on down there on the screen first

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,309
of all we might want to make a short

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,200
quick introduction around faces here I

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,670
don't know lots of other people

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,879
following around at home it might be

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,449
nice to be able to connect the faces to

00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,890
the name so those of you who feel like

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,220

I'm David burger I forget when I joined

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:26,530

them over being around for visual world

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:49,149
hi I'm and I just joined the club a few

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:55,329
weeks ago I began trying to add a group

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:56,770
a few weeks ago russell berrie I have

00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:00,280
been a member of the pro groups but

00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,860
mostly don't do anything but I

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,869
occasionally upload a package and I'm

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,060
been doing a very poor job of being

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:09,060
upstream for the plot generation tools

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,599
and you don't have

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,540
oh my name is Josh Enders and I'm a pro

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,540
user

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,000
okay so Colton Watson augment in a

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,830
couple of our modules no actually in the

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,770
crowd Griffith buffs Mac Noah by our

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,830
hands I'm not an active member of the

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,200
Debian Perl group but I'm here to try to

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,970
maybe bootstrap some activity into it

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,780
and get more familiar with what's

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,910
happening at how I can help

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,670
amnesia and I'm not a member of the

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:53,990
group but I am really interested and

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:59,120
currently I maintaining one all related

00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:00,680
package hi I'm Ryan I was active in the

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,190
program a while ago and I'm interested

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,080
in getting back into it I'm Alex I'm

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,080
actually not in the part but they do

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,920
maintain some of our monuments and a lot

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,370
of moral code I'd built McAlister a

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,650
pearl loser

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,650
we knew the microphone

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,210
and in theory and part of the property

00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,520
for a while and focusing and the GTE

00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:35,560
leap and things like that

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,850
Madhu's and Benjamin have been not part

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,190
of the prayer group for a while but

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:45,810
still looking around by marching those

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:52,120
six contributor new to the Debian group

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:54,880
and then we have someone in the back so

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,550
I'm I have apparently been a member of

00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,200
the Perl group for years but only a

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:04,900
couple of months ago I got three

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:08,560
packages in so I'm really active thank

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,980
several products so what we've seen now

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,860
is that the group has quite a few

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,380
members I mean it well packaged pearl

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,489
flow check on areas and haven't looked

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:26,490
at that recently but I think it's

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:29,860
something like 200 feet long yeah oh I

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:34,120
want you to look at the first at first

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:39,700
item which probably was taking a quick

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:45,030
look at the at the team itself so I'd

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:48,880
like to to open the floor for people to

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:52,540
give them the Impressionist and feelings

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,780
how the group as a group is doing how

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,600
the situation with

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,820
members is do we have enough or not or

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,890
not is there something we could improve

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:09,450
in this regard communication cooperation

00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:13,170
seems like this and I have used

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:17,160
statistics which are just some numbers

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:20,160
afterwards but I just like to open up to

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
others

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,070
well I for my part I think the group is

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,440
doing okay there might be a bit less

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,390
people than we used to have not quite

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,060
sure actually and I have had the feeling

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:47,530
for some years now that the sheer amount

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:49,660
of packets is sort of there are bugs

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,800
that don't get any attention from us I

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,840
think sort of normal or minor bugs or

00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,730
something like that when they are not

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,850
easy ones I know we've been forwarding

00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,300
them better that may be better than we

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,760
used to

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:11,640
well there's lots of data streams and

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:15,700
things like that - yeah not bad anyway

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:20,550
what good actually I 4,000 packages or

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,550
whatever we have three yeah well

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,160
is it just me or has the number of

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,040
packages grown much faster than the

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:34,450
number of team members yeah it's not

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,120
just me okay so it's actually the same

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:42,420
picture I mean I'm not in a position to

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,420
criticize because I'm not active

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,550
anyone else which is what Billy just was

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,310
going to say that remember in 2008 and

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,600
the title of my talk about that was six

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:08,680
six six packages so that's probably at

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:11,200
this tiny number by now yeah I mean from

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,890
my point of view I also had this

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:19,840
impression that you mention each other

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:27,330
which we've lost a bit momentum maybe

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:27,330
lost some contributors mostly during the

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,570
2012-2013 year with the long freeze so

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,940
what I did the other day was to try to

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:41,370
look at some some numbers if this

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,370
expression can be backed up by numbers

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,910
Oh

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:57,430
so I looked at get come it's it's it's

00:07:53,139 --> 00:08:00,190
flatlock which they told me to use and

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,080
counted the number of predators in the

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,520
earth of people making from it in the

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,210
last videos and the result is that the

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,360
numbers don't support my my impression

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:20,200
so that we user from September 1st to

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:23,050
August 31st and the number of people

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,560
making at least one commit to one of us

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:31,450
with hasn't repository repositories

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Debian directories is not changing a lot

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:39,550
from 83 to 71 the last year was a bit

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:44,080
low and now it's 84 again and then I've

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:46,750
counted totally manually the amount of

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,380
people with more than 10 commits and

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:53,320
with more than hundred commits and these

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,930
numbers are actually quite stable I

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,400
might also have missed a day in between

00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,740
or something I'm not sure if this

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,460
Stinson until is inclusive or exclusive

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,850
but just to give a rough idea about the

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,850
numbers

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,270
good angle

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,270
yes do you have statistics for uploaders

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,470
I was asking Gregor if he had statistics

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:28,220
for the number of active uploaders which

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:31,699
is always a bit of a worry of mine but I

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:37,610
know there's maybe three or two active

00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:44,629
bloggers from one there are more okay so

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:48,319
maybe I worry too much yeah

00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:53,980
so what remains is to something we need

00:09:48,319 --> 00:10:02,869
to do in attracting new contributors and

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:05,839
maintaining existing contributors I

00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:08,149
would like to say that as a I guess my

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,199
main involvement is as an occasional

00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:15,559
downstream from you because I often find

00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:17,449
myself dealing with the with parallel

00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,029
version transitions in Ubuntu in

00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:22,160
response to two corresponding things of

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,309
debian syrup recently just build in like

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,759
20 and my impression from that side of

00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:33,739
things as somebody who deals with this

00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:36,230
from downstream of various deputies is

00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:39,499
that the parent team is one of the best

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,779
organized the transitions are generally

00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:43,699
excellently well prepared there are

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,829
there are a small number of things to

00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:48,370
clean up like there always are that's

00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:49,839
fine I think phone

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,820
not point of view the question is

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:57,610
whether you folks can cope and you know

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,320
just avoiding Bernard's but as far as

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,520
whether you're doing a good enough job I

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,690
think you're doing an excellent job so

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,690
just keep it up

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,740
well so

00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:21,319
regarding attracting new contributors

00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:24,209
and maybe more diverse contributors

00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:27,029
there's this low hanging fruit sessions

00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:29,149
that we've had this Sharon will talk

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,709
about a bit later on today so I

00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:40,789
refrained from elaborating on its right

00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:44,099
now so now time to put in my

00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:48,269
contribution is a new project members

00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:53,609
and what I found as barriers to entry

00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:55,799
and it was hard for me too it shouldn't

00:11:53,609 --> 00:12:00,209
have been in retrospect to find the best

00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,099
practices for doing packages by the Perl

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:06,419
group which would be distinct from what

00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:08,339
I would have done on my own or it was

00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,049
not clear to me how I could get their

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,219
package which was already maintained in

00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:16,079
Debian into the Perl group I have been

00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:18,479
invited several times to hand it over

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,119
but I wasn't sure how it could help the

00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:25,469
process and become a good active group

00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:29,519
member at the same time yeah maybe it's

00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:31,949
a matter of educating the people who are

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,239
outside the group about how easy it is

00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:38,969
to get in and what it is that they have

00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:44,069
to do in order to follow the standards

00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:45,929
and your group practices giving you talk

00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:48,319
at DEP points is probably a great way to

00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,319
start

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,210
I guess it could be a short document if

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,300
you know how to use IRC and so if you

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:05,750
show up on Debian pearl everything else

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:08,810
follows I think to become an active

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:12,350
member of the I mean so I am not

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,450
discounting that we do have some time

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,900
convinced right but maybe they need to

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,930
be more publicized or something but I I

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,800
wanted to wake up for anybody who is

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,350
thinking about joining the team that

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,390
what we're talking about here is a

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,150
communication issue and not actually

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,950
being difficult to join the team so just

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,930
show up and people will walk you through

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,550
actually that's maybe one of the few

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,550
ways I'm still active in the team is

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:44,590
giving people some hints on how to get

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,590
started when they show up on IRC

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,260
okay so yes we jump to the next topic

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,990
yeah

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:21,790
right so I guess many of you have heard

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:24,590
about this project from unique called

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,500
contribute test which is about to

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,480
collect in one central place all

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,260
contributions from every while who

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,360
contribute something to Debian it is a

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:39,920
commit an upload and edit did a wiki a

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:45,470
translation of whatever and where we're

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:50,240
from group currently don't don't add our

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:53,530
tag tools to these contributions we

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,720
don't have a separate sub projector so

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,840
the teacher knows a bit about it and

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,190
might kibbutz and service represented I

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:05,120
was trying to find a girl they copy a

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:08,000
link to and from if you come see this

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,480
vehicle project I think of starlings

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,600
here I was a bit involved in the idea

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,850
before um but basically yeah that is to

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,100
to get solid sources information from

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,080
different places and said okay these

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,740
people this person has to do something

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,920
for some thing or something and that's a

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,200
way of saying who has helped them in any

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,590
way that way to recognize people and I

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,470
think it's pretty cool so I just got

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,780
sign up by and wrinkled and didn't have

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,390
much of a choice and to maintain the

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:44,180
gift source which is basically still not

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,680
there so that woman and I will also do

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,200
our special source for the package third

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,990
group says whatever that's why I

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,080
arranged for the memory yesterday so I

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,280
just need to get down and do it but

00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,870
basically what you will have in a few

00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,900
days is that every time you make a

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:04,430
comment you will appear as a contributor

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:09,350
up to that date under the get and then

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:13,150
the package pero ESO SI see I think

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,150
that's negative is so much more

00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,500
okay look like looks like that's taken

00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,830
care of all right thank you the UL for

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,630
the whole thing is contrary justice

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,770
contributors dr. Vincent org if you want

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,770
to look around

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,240
okay so then the next one is a more

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:41,620
technical problem lots of package test

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:46,690
step 8 enhancement proposal dated idea

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:49,420
to have the binary built packages tested

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,340
also integrated into the see I taught a

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,980
bientot let the gas continues

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,740
inspiration we're not doing this right

00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:01,540
now and quick when the public wants to

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:04,240
say something about it yeah well I

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:09,250
mainly wanted to keep it on the agenda

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,980
we discussed it briefly last year I

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,440
think we had a thread about it last

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,660
winter November's something like that

00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:21,760
and came up with the fuel technical

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:26,980
maybe solution might be a bit strong

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,640
forward but us anyway as I see it should

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,230
be mostly trivial to get most of the

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,700
pika cheaper modules

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:39,340
packages to to just declared that their

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:44,520
own test suit can be used as an auto

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:47,320
pickets at this switch as well but uh

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,400
there probably are some exceptions where

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,950
you you need to write to the T directory

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,720
and stuff like that most of it should be

00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:00,880
straightforward so I guess we maybe just

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,490
should revisit that and maybe I have a

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:09,160
hacking session or something while we're

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:13,600
here I don't know find the time but it

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:19,049
sure does anybody know how complete this

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:21,149
yeah Debian internet her test

00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:25,230
that's it how I think that's it trying

00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:33,840
the taste Center stuff like that what's

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:37,679
the status currently here and I think a

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,299
Tony Paris tomorrow so you should

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,700
probably ask him tomorrow but it

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:50,070
apparently runs for me and for my own

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:52,470
taxes there are many dogs already and I

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,840
think the goal was to always run when

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,539
the dependency package changes and it

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,600
appears to do that so I think it's

00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:02,870
usable project yeah that's the main

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,750
thing when the reverse dependencies

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:12,500
change then try to check the roundup

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,500
tests yep no more on this topic I think

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,020
yeah I guess sitting together tacking on

00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,810
it would be nice

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:26,220
does someone want to take the ownership

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:33,180
of this action item as in pushing and

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:35,420
reminding others but it's a nice clean

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,420
slate

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,330
I can take ownership for the duration of

00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:53,880
death gone but then I probably forget

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:55,800
about it okay because I want to learn

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,340
about auto packaged test so this is a

00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,340
good opportunity

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:20,289
I am the next things were short

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:23,740
information also started last year and

00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:26,419
the same of the idea of integrating

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,690
upstream git repositories into our

00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:34,640
packaging git repositories which could

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:37,400
build package supports while adding the

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,000
travel on top of the upstream tech forum

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,760
any minute

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,630
correctly to make this easier there are

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:53,090
now some free scripts in the package

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:55,400
Perl tools package well only get free

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:59,929
flow of the have the package the last

00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:06,400
word is not uploaded yet so you can then

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:09,830
just type TPT the total input all right

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,530
which will use you scan and create the

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,270
remote and should do it

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,120
everything that's it is but still

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:19,370
missing is integration into our fancy M

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,440
our config so that the remote is added

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:27,470
when when you clone a repository well

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,049
fetch it up updated the thing it also

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,559
needs to go into the PT checkout which

00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:36,620
is the command of DB T - well just check

00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:40,789
the repository without caring about URLs

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:44,870
so I think that should also or might

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:45,650
also be an aunt asked for hacking time

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:50,750
which we

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:52,490
in abundance yeah

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,860
after breakfast David owned it and

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,490
talked about it with him today and I

00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:03,310
think I can take the responsibility to

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,310
remind you guys to sit down with with me

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:13,510
yeah that too okay so that's it for me

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,510
for this point

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:26,140
all right one of the recurring topics

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,970
for discussion which we have each year

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,649
well first for many years we had should

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,169
we switch from subversion to get but

00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:35,860
simply has to switch to get three years

00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:43,950
ago the next flickering topic is how do

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:46,899
we manage our cheese yeah well I just

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,570
wanted to keep this one on the agenda -

00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:54,880
because I just hate committing fat seeds

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:59,169
to get and I mean editing the patch is

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,559
there and forgetting to dope will pass

00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:04,750
after checking out the repository then

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,169
building I know the pickety building

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:12,389
packages will apply them for me but

00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:16,990
sometimes I do it the old way but anyway

00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:19,539
there's this talk of these these things

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,639
in the project it was worth - at the

00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,370
moment I think the Patton group is

00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:26,830
looking at alternatives and they said

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,799
traded Debian that the Debian table list

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:34,269
as well I think it looks like this

00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:37,419
broader interests in this for what is so

00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:39,909
as we are we've been using DT p.m. for

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,809
fence management in the perk package for

00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:48,039
a couple of years at least maybe more

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:51,850
and it's working great the idea is that

00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:54,730
the patches on it creates temporary

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:58,409
brands further from the fences and a new

00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:01,690
editors with normal tools and then you

00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:03,970
transform them back to that system it's

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,580
fine then this did build packets and

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,320
advance key thing and I think there's a

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,850
third one yep sorry

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,850
whatever I think yeah

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,579
one of my apparently increasing number

00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,259
of tasks for deaf golf is to actually

00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:24,209
upload deaf cherry sauce and so my one

00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,999
user is sitting across the room and this

00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:33,899
exactly I hundred percent approval

00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:38,759
rating cherries so the idea of deaf

00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:40,379
cherry is to treat I guess

00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,169
the debian branch as an integration

00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:49,319
branch where your packaging commits are

00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:55,249
just part of the get history and extract

00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:58,559
those as patches at packet built time so

00:24:55,249 --> 00:25:03,119
well there's all kinds of trade-offs if

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:05,699
this is one trade-off which is that it's

00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:10,499
the most natural way of working with if

00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:13,049
you are if you came to Debian from get

00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:14,609
rather than the other way around this is

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:17,099
somehow the most natural way of working

00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:20,119
my knowledge it wants to advocate myself

00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:22,859
for it more slowly than I do I think

00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:28,499
this was a very bad explanation that's

00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:31,499
probably because he wrote software and

00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:34,709
you're using it to give them you create

00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:37,729
your upstream branch either the

00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:39,799
upstreams branch or what's being put in

00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:42,839
using the tarballs

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:46,219
any person that can you create your own

00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:50,789
feature branch and you work with with it

00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:52,859
then you create the master branch by

00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:57,359
default which has your daughter's baby

00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:59,519
in it and this is where you merge in all

00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,909
your feature branches to have it see

00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:06,119
with it builds and you test it you never

00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:09,299
worry about dots Ashley Benson / patches

00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,919
because definitely comes in and will

00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:14,369
take care of all that for you we just

00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:16,619
say go ahead build a package while is it

00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:19,139
being checked out and built dot says the

00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:22,409
winds - patches is created you never

00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:25,440
have to worry about doing pushing the

00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:28,199
quilt stuff you never have to worry

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,919
about editing patches you work with

00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:33,449
feature branches and you work your

00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,329
forests packages as if you were just

00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:39,779
using pure get for development

00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:42,059
this is I've got a paper route there

00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:44,429
which I will share to the Debian double

00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:48,589
mailing list after I came back home when

00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:53,969
I compared get DPM and Deb cherry and

00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:57,419
the history and bisect ability increases

00:26:53,969 --> 00:27:01,309
by an order of magnitude if you're using

00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:04,589
DEP cherry because there are no faith

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:08,279
ephemeral branches to get in your way of

00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:10,769
bisecting what you did there is nothing

00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,859
to get in you way of being able to sell

00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:19,229
features back upstream because it is a

00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:22,649
feature branch by itself I really think

00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:24,299
it made it kind of shaves off about

00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:28,219
thirty percent of the time that I used

00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,219
to spend packaging things

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:45,700
this software sounds amazing and I must

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:48,580
try it okay so I guess we won't take a

00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,670
decision right now in this minute in

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,610
that mean we have a tradition of taking

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,520
some years until everyone is happy

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,080
everyone is happy so how do how do we

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,650
proceed from here that's probably the

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:05,230
question if you want to look at

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:08,500
programming very example you look for

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,170
three packages that have my name in

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,580
German uploader and they have been using

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,580
it actually for this

00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,700
so I guess that kind of brings us on to

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:27,090
the question about how a uniform do we

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,640
need to be within the team in terms of

00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,070
packaging consistency because there's

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,960
one sense in which it would be nice to

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,850
be able to demonstrate in within the

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,640
group different approaches but on the

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,620
other hand the whole point of have an

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,060
aggrieved is that we have some level of

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,560
uniformity so I don't know what the

00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:52,590
solution to that is maybe we should have

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:54,240
a kind of a list of experiments that are

00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,910
ongoing or demonstrations that's wrong

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,550
going that we can refer to and then we

00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,550
know to treat those packages with care

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:11,250
we already do this for the packaging

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,260
helper which shall not behave so I think

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:16,020
we could probably adopt some convention

00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,150
that you know this package is packaging

00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,850
experiment or something you know that

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:23,580
end that's an implicit promise that the

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,500
person doing the experiment will take

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:29,730
care of that package and not expect

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,950
other people to to deal with it yeah and

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:35,760
maybe list it on some some of our wiki

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,980
pages so that it's also visible within

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,750
without stumbling a comment right I

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,490
don't know how formalize it needs to be

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,830
weekend you know but argument was

00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,890
something they are right I mean maybe it

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,790
would also nice to have some some ISC

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,240
sessions

00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:54,120
I guess momentum concern when with which

00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:58,290
techniques is we have to make sure that

00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,420
at least in theory 200 people but I mean

00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:03,170
you've seen 80 people commit something

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,520
in a year so that all those people are

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:10,200
taking along and are feeling comfortable

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:13,620
so did ya need some some some training

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,570
and I I'd like to learn something on I

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,840
see when someone teaches me there so

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,990
maybe that's also a way to go to do it

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,230
demo

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,660
tryouts enter so the comment from IRC

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:30,210
dam suggests maybe using readme dot

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:32,440
source to document any crazy experiments

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,280
decided seem reasonable - oh yeah

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,730
totally

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:41,770
okay so well whom you made some decision

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:44,700
I get stressed I know don't tell don't

00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,700
tell the Technical Committee

00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:02,380
I volunteer the first three packages

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,590
depth demonstrate deaf cherry I'll write

00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:08,200
up a readme door sorceress say what I've

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:10,470
done and clearly if you're using double

00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,600
J there isn't really much you're

00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,220
actually putting in into gate I mean the

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,880
whole point is that you don't do

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:25,480
anything and let them carry handle it

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:28,510
thank you okay and can you send a

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:34,620
message let the hope great knife gonna

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:34,620
follow my name is Jane good

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:49,780
I think I ought to do the same with ya I

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:53,270
guess I should look at using get DPM for

00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,730
sworn to picket cheaper finishes for

00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,440
some reason what fell does come into

00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:01,040
mind but I'm not sure if that's the one

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:05,330
to start with that's that's one of those

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,930
which would benefit will be from profits

00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,350
handling

00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,490
anyway there's all kinds of yeah there's

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,890
a differentials already

00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:18,650
doesn't that season a few branches so

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:30,290
yeah so the next one is a shot status

00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:33,100
update on the hardening so we've made

00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:39,320
good progress this year in ensuring that

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:42,320
many or most of our been architectural

00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:48,050
dependent packages are built using the

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,120
harder harden built flags I have no idea

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:53,480
what's to come stats about it but it's

00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,790
quite good and what I would love and its

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,780
is more like a code for help because I

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:02,690
won't do it myself is to be able as a

00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:06,170
team to track our progress in this

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:09,950
respect to know if we are doing better

00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:12,620
or worse than before and to be able to

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:15,500
easily identify action items that is

00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:20,030
what's left to do possibly ordered by a

00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:22,220
priority of something so one good basis

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,220
for this could be case cooks scripts

00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:29,080
that generate this worldwide statistics

00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:31,280
about it the thing is the scripts only

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,580
basically look at each package and

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,760
increment counter counters and don't

00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,970
have any memory in the end to to tell

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,260
you which package was hardened and all

00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,690
was not so this

00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,580
should be a simple matter of patent

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:51,150
programming for anyone trust it should

00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,390
be quite each desk and it's been

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:57,420
documented in great details and the

00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:02,780
tails back tracker what you need to do

00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:06,690
and some leads and how to do it so if we

00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:10,950
if someone took this task then it could

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:13,800
be very useful for any Debian packaging

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:16,649
team or maintenance or would like to you

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,990
to make progress on this and to be

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:23,190
useful for test two and possibly for

00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:26,179
other Debian derivatives if you're

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,179
interested talk to me

00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:37,260
I think there's lint in chequered to

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:41,639
that track those hard-partying flagship

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:45,240
bottle or in effect so it might be

00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,240
enough to just count them cut those over

00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,210
time but it's not very very elegant

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:56,129
anyway I just like to point out that the

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:58,410
with a 5.20 transition there's in the

00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:02,190
current city city person of the package

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,869
there's a bug that effects from looks

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,150
like there's three packages that have

00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,440
lost the Harding implants and it would

00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,050
be nice very nice

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,670
to have a system that would point them

00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:18,150
out quickly in this case it was mostly

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,089
bad luck that gregor or Tamia noticed

00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:26,640
did with the WX

00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:28,650
package you know yeah okay just one

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,530
sentence in my experience the Lindsey

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,690
and check for hardening is not totally

00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:39,930
accurate at least it doesn't totally

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:44,760
agree with the LHC hardening check Russ

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:46,200
is nothing so yeah the there are still

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,940
seem to be a lot of false positives

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,130
where it thinks that you're not building

00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,569
hardening when you effect are and I

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,950
think that a lot of that is that it's

00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:55,650
really difficult to detect whether you

00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,660
have hardening turned on for some of the

00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,369
strength functions there's there's just

00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,190
a lot of code matters that will generate

00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:03,869
non hardened calls without any hardened

00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,670
calls in the same binary and then Lin

00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,190
thean can't figure out that you have

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,559
hardening flags turned on so I that

00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,450
affects multiple of my packages and I've

00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,579
like me annually double check the

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,349
compiler flags on every single object

00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:20,950
file and I'm quite certain that they're

00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:24,380
built with hardening Flags okay

00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:27,070
this and also another source does the

00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:31,280
build lot checks checks this some

00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:33,620
something that scanning them at the

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,100
moment I think there's a link somewhere

00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:39,620
to build lock checks where's this yours

00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,020
the other neurosis well and I think it's

00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,910
notice is when the Harding flexor

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,630
missing as well so there might be

00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:50,240
another approach yeah and if someone is

00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:54,620
writing is interacting writing code talk

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,400
to excellent we have something like nine

00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:02,120
eight minutes left but we're getting

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:08,600
closer to the bottom of the list so low

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:10,340
hanging fruit sessions so our last year

00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,470
to as proposed to you have monthly

00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,710
low-hanging fruit station that is we

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:18,410
meet and IRC in a date scheduled in

00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:21,050
advance and we spend a few Harold's

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,390
together working in low-hanging fruits

00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,000
that is think that we can do a lot of

00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:28,550
and and clean up our plate and get a

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,550
quiet feeling of walking together on

00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:34,000
making progress and small repetitive

00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:36,650
tasks that are not always fun to do and

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,430
I think we've worked on forwarding

00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:48,470
batches lecture on hardening handling

00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:51,800
one transition I think - and with down I

00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:56,690
think three or four such sessions in

00:37:51,800 --> 00:38:03,250
total and then it's disappear the mostly

00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:03,250
because of stopping or coordinating it

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:13,230
so my question will be do we want to

00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:17,790
start it again do we want to change the

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:22,140
format of it and how do we make the

00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:25,710
organization lighter so that it's we

00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:30,300
don't stop again doing it because of the

00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:34,200
other work of our head so if anyone but

00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:37,530
they didn't has any feedback whether

00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,470
they would like to start it over or not

00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,240
or possibly changing the format that

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:49,140
would be a good time to share these

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:51,569
feelings and I did well I like the

00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,830
meetings and I would like to get them

00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:55,880
going again

00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,880
[Music]

00:38:56,569 --> 00:39:05,690
anyone else comment from Ric Italian

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,690
says they're totally great

00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:16,290
so I thought was going to echo dams IRC

00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,330
comment but I also throw in my own

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:20,400
opinion which I think this would be a

00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,700
really useful way to get new people

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,520
involved in things you know it's the the

00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,260
problems are self-contained and they're

00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,880
their concrete they're easy to wrap your

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,980
head around and get something done and

00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,400
so it would be really I think it'd be

00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:38,070
really useful just to make this make

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,780
sure that these sessions are sort of

00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:43,610
well publicized I guess easy to find out

00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,610
about and see what shows up

00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,590
is it worth even publicizing them beyond

00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:53,250
the current project their current great

00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:55,680
to the air to the projects at large as a

00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,470
way of getting more people involved in

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,540
the project given that we have a

00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:06,630
possibly difficulty getting new people

00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:12,060
in actually then continue actively okay

00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:13,650
five minutes so please be short I think

00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,650
a lot of the things I wanted to mention

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:21,150
I don't know if now is the time which

00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:23,670
one on your list for the low-hanging

00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,800
fruits we should probably talk about you

00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:31,200
should say one sentence about having a

00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:33,420
tape per month then yeah to make the

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,700
organization later my proposal would be

00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,800
that we choose a fixed date in the

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,430
months and do it every months in the

00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,260
same date and then we can refine the the

00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:48,060
time details later

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:50,100
so pick the 17 from 23rd or whatever we

00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:54,300
can do that later on a very male eat

00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:56,370
that's fine with you okay so we have two

00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,790
issues left which are not really

00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:03,120
relevant 202 tool on the open tasks

00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:06,510
anyway so okay please use the last two

00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,800
or three minutes okay so we had a couple

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,470
of things came up with the bootstrap

00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,700
sprint last week one of which was the

00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,280
fact that it's very hard to cross build

00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,100
Perl which makes it hard to bootstrap

00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,180
new architectures because bells

00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,220
important

00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,810
has to happen quite early on I just

00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,950
wondered if anybody Sonia Williams did a

00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,200
lot of work on this about a year ago

00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,820
which made it basically we hacked round

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,270
the problems to some degree with a

00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:32,220
debian pearl cross package which just

00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,260
stores the the results that you would

00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,520
get if you were able to run the things

00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,320
the way pearl expects you to on a

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,200
foreign machine but even does anybody

00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,970
care about this problem and as wants to

00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,500
help try and improve matters because

00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,300
upstream seemed quite enthusiastic to

00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,040
have some improvements when when Neal

00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,920
talked to them but because he suddenly

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,990
got a job with all this action just

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,220
stopped and I haven't seen know it

00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,610
suppose anything's changed in the

00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,440
intervening year or so anyway we would

00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:02,280
like to put big question for Tom

00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,870
Bleecker I do know the state of cross

00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,660
compilation upstream is probably a bit

00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:08,310
better than this time last year

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:11,670
particularly because I think the Android

00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:14,520
port was done that way so it was

00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,080
probably worth me Oneko looking at

00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:21,330
whether there's any anything we should

00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:22,740
be integrating what doing so we think

00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,090
some of that stuff may have filtered

00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,600
through actually and there has been some

00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,380
improvements okay he'll be good sir I'm

00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,510
in helmets

00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:34,020
Karuna is running a thing called reboot

00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:35,400
strap on Jenkins everyday trying to see

00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,260
what happens so the moment it gets about

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,080
40 packages in with a lot of hackery and

00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,690
bow jury and one of the problems is is

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:45,210
pearl so anyway something to bear in

00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:48,900
mind and the other thing is the lust

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:51,330
that come we talked about the embedded

00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,770
well multi origin Bennett interpreter

00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,810
problem I don't know how many people

00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,950
here understand that issue but it turns

00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:01,440
out yeah exactly none of us but it

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:02,700
turned out that this solution we came up

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,230
with last year doesn't actually work

00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,810
because of the way deep package operates

00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:10,710
so it's still broken and we don't really

00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:12,840
have a good solution yet and I don't

00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,060
know because I know you if you send

00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,990
plaintive mails going but I did this is

00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,380
that good or bad

00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,760
and everyone just went no silence so I'm

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,240
not exactly sure what it is we've ended

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,880
up releasing and what level of breakage

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,740
and multi arch pearl crossness we have

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,640
achieved because I haven't really the

00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:36,390
to Troy for the fact that 20 packages

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,360
I've made the per package itself Multi

00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:42,660
oats a lot and per modules is not yet

00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,619
foreign and that's just far as I dared

00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:50,760
to go and the long ways you mentioned

00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:56,880
have been such sort of well it's not

00:43:50,760 --> 00:44:00,360
encouraging one more thing is that I did

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,330
see Killam mention on some in some mail

00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,970
of his that he's going to fix all the

00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:07,950
remaining multicharts box before Jesse

00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:10,530
I'm not sure if he was serious but I

00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:13,650
suppose he's going to revisit this issue

00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:16,220
said as well I don't know here we have

00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,220
one minute left

00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:26,510
I'm wondering is any one of you using

00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:26,510
cart on the panel of four total approach

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:34,560
you know it's it's like you're

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,250
developing some well project and

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:41,100
depending on cPanel stuff but don't want

00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,560
to package it yet so the idea is to just

00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:47,970
install it in your working directory and

00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,650
if it's working you're consider it which

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,350
is quite possible for continuous

00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,570
integration stuff with developers having

00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:57,840
the own environment available before

00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:02,100
actually doing some packaging work like

00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:05,700
depending on new versions and I'm I'm

00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:08,670
feeling like it's not really that common

00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:15,359
to use so I'm wondering if it that could

00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:19,470
raise some attention maybe it's a

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,690
curtain is MIA cows work and it is it

00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,570
does actually generate Debian packaging

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:26,100
I wouldn't necessarily say it's of such

00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,960
high quality that you would want to put

00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,030
it straight into the distro but the

00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,580
intention is that if someone is running

00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:36,030
their services on Debian that they could

00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:38,220
use carton to make a standard bundle for

00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:40,260
all the perl modules that they need and

00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,430
then when they deploy they can actually

00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,020
just have that bundle

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:49,050
create Debian packages and install them

00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:51,990
I'm it's kind of like Python wheels you

00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,910
kind of have to debate whether you

00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,430
really want that to be using that in the

00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,990
distro it's it's in some ways a

00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,819
competing way of distributing perl

00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,780
modules

00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:05,700
yeah and for those interested it's

00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:07,500
packaged I'm a Verna this packaging I'm

00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:11,520
using the de package but it has its

00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:15,059
flaws so I'm wondering if no so if more

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,550
elements to look using it yeah so I got

00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:20,599
some some scary looks from behind and

00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,599
some science that we're out of time

00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:28,230
so yeah well thank you

00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:31,829
let's let's call it the buff let's meet

00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:35,599
again next year and before on IRC and

00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:35,599
