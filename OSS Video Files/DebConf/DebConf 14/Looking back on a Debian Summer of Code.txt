	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,449
so first we'll start with a show of

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,950
hands who here has heard about debt

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,069
metrics or metrics that they've even

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:12,150
done that already wow that's a lot more

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,830
than I thought so about the metrics the

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,080
first question you probably have is was

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,850
done metrics that metrics is a software

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,070
powering metrics Debbie and Annette is

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,560
an interface for adding new metrics

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,570
there are two types of metrics pull

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,029
metrics one is a script locally on that

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,099
metric server they pull data from some

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:34,350
source push metrics ron has on on some

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,760
remote server and send data to the

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,399
metric server via HTTP POST request

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,489
metrics are defined by a manifest file

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,190
the manifest file contains all sorts of

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,640
data about a metric to add a new metric

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,440
you should submit a patch to me or the

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,449
QA mailing list the patch should add a

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,289
manifest file and also full script if

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,969
the metric is a pull metric that metrics

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,890
is also a web interface for viewing

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,270
graphs and tables the graphs and tables

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,610
are dynamic through the use of

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,080
JavaScript the graphs can be overlaid

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,960
and the tables can be sorted ascending

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,479
or descending by each column if the

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,340
javascript is disabled static map

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,009
follow-up graphs are used long static

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,640
tables if javascript is enabled the

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,689
graphs can be overlaid in tables to be

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,430
sorted ascending and descending by each

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,110
column why does metrics that metrics

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,729
provides a universal interface to

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,619
metrics this is useful because

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,869
statistics are scattered all over the

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,579
place the universal interface allows

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,240
metrics to become bared inlays are not

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,530
possible if the metrics are scattered a

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,630
universal interface also makes backing

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,350
up data easier because there is a single

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,960
location to back up data from these are

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,979
the technologies that metrics uses you

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,979
can review the loss to yourself

00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:01,420
jQuery plugins jQuery UI is used by the

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,149
dynamic interface for some UI elements a

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,840
number of jQuery plugins are used by fly

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:10,810
hidden grass and flats used to generate

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,310
the dynamic graphs hidden graphs is used

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,590
to show/hide the series on the graph

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,410
time allows your time to be plotted on

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,510
the x-axis tooltip allows for displaying

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,040
the data related to the point when the

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,760
user Mouse's over a point on the graph

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,640
and super legends is a plugin that I

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,099
wrote and it allows multiple metrics to

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,630
be added to the graph while placing a

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:33,040
heading for each metric in the legend to

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,079
keep the series that belong to each

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,630
metric separate from the rest you can

00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:41,799
see in the picture the red X's that let

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:46,390
you delete the delete the metrics and

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:51,940
the labels listing the metric names that

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:54,430
are added by that plug in the current

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,489
metrics this is the list of the current

00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:00,790
metrics are available at metrics W net

00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:04,810
and if you keep listening you will find

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,579
out how to add your own metric hacking

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:14,739
on dem metrics

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:17,410
this is how you hack undead metrics I'm

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:19,120
gonna skip over that how do you add a

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,400
new metric you need to add a manifest

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,170
file to the manifest directory if the

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,940
metric is a pole metric he should add a

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,100
postscript to the PostScript directory

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,630
if the metric is a push metric you

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,790
should add a push script to the remote

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,100
server you had a cron job to the server

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,720
to run the script every so often you can

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,220
also add a custom graph script to the

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,400
grass scripts directory if you wish but

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,930
is optional the graph script allows you

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,590
make a graph of it in the vault time

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,139
series graph at this time the graph the

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,310
custom grass scripts are not supported

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:52,630
well I mean by that is they won't

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:56,040
display in the web interface this is an

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,040
example manifest file

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,639
the manifesto Lee starts off with script

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,349
1 originally I planned for more than one

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,579
script for manifest so that is why there

00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:08,780
is a one the type is push or pull freak

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:12,860
is the frequency to run the script at

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,810
is in contact format script is location

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,380
of the full scripts to run right now is

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,519
not it does not work so you have to make

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,790
the name of the full script in the

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,500
manifest match fields are the name

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,280
London type of each field in database

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,889
the names must be valid Python names you

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,900
don't need to include TS because TS is

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:37,300
on that we added and lost over IDs is

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,590
true what TS is is it's time series

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,690
format is the format in which data is

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,520
returned by the script delete before

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,210
answer being true means that data is

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,430
deleted from database before each new

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,870
time new day is inserted graph type

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,940
determines what type of graph is

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,820
generated right now is just a folder

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,280
custom default being a time series line

00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,979
graph and custom being the graph script

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,830
and the graph scripts directory and

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:06,830
description is just a description that

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,810
gets displayed in the web interface this

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:13,160
is an example script you can read

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:16,850
through that and so it just writes data

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:23,229
to so standard owl it writes the headers

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,229
first and then it writes the actual data

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,110
we have a to do list there and these are

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,130
a list of some of the items that we have

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,830
to do still the make portable v-mobile

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,110
to-do item means that we want to make

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,919
the portable iam bowl so that you could

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,360
replace the like the Debbie logo with

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,590
your own logo so that other

00:05:50,360 --> 00:06:00,250
organizations can use this to to contact

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,250
us use wqa mailing list or wqa on oft c

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:09,830
now i'm going to show you that metrics

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,300
this is what you see when you first open

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,380
up the dem metrics website

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,330
it's the static interface it was the

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,490
metrics the description of the metrics

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,640
so if i click on one like VCS that

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,200
provides statistics on the number of

00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:31,750
packages using each version control

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:34,580
system so you see a graph here and

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,760
there's the download CSV you link that

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,010
lets you play around with the data and

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,030
then there's all the data in the table

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:48,500
and finally there's some statistics mean

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,810
standard deviation min max if we go up

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:55,490
here click on dynamic this is the

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:58,159
dynamic interface we could select

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,440
something like VCS and metric to graph

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:05,030
it displays a graph and it lets you

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:12,159
mouse over and see the data points show

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:12,159
metric and table displays a table and

00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,210
that's about it

00:07:17,879 --> 00:08:04,869
any questions yep no there's no working

00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:07,139
area and as far as time I'm not really

00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,139
sure

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,650
you will do that elsewhere and just push

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,530
the results to the metric infrastructure

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,909
and even elsewhere that's not the

00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,290
solution you're looking for again but

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,150
actually in the Deming community we

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,820
already have plenty of statistics that

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,380
already have those elsewhere we just

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,060
wanted to have a single place where to

00:08:51,380 --> 00:09:03,200
centralize the data so that's a kind of

00:08:53,060 --> 00:09:07,510
a different problem okay so in the

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,400
script you showed us you had time

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:14,330
something time property like it was zero

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:19,030
zero asterisk asterisk what does that

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,030
exactly mean zero is your ass

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,360
oh there it is

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:33,760
that's just crying that format so it

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,610
means that it's gonna run everyday so

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,160
you're going to let the person who

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,589
writes the script besides this or yeah

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:48,070
so they decided by putting in the

00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:54,380
manifest what ever okay so why are five

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:56,839
numbers there okay I see okay

00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,399
and if for example if I want to add a

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,930
new Deb metric

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,290
I'm currently porting from you've been

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,890
to the review and rating server for

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:13,010
packages so it's just ratings for

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:18,500
packages five stars stuff like that

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:23,149
can I integrate it with this so if it's

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:25,279
Ubuntu that wouldn't be part of that

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,529
material on porting I'm putting from

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,320
event due to Debian with Debian specific

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:33,860
oh okay so if it's W metrics and you

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,060
could add that to the Ted metrics the

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,040
metrics that they're being done at

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:43,579
website so you can certainly add that so

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,070
what was the process to upload the new

00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:48,290
Deb metrics do you need to accept it

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,690
into the project or anyone can add their

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,699
own deb metrics because i can't really

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,180
think it's if you're a Debian developer

00:10:52,699 --> 00:11:00,940
right if you're a W developer you could

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:03,829
add your own by committing to the QA

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,850
repository okay okay so I understand

00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,850
thanks yeah

00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:24,329
so are there any more questions well

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:33,869
then thank you very much

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:52,249
Joseph so the next presentation will be

00:11:33,869 --> 00:12:09,359
by Giuliana on WebRTC any help here

00:11:52,249 --> 00:12:11,999
no you're gonna fit this long hefty

00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:14,749
stays on don't think I'm putting it on

00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,749
right but okay

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:48,360
all right I think that's good okay all

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:51,870
right um just a second all right so my

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,620
work on google Summer of Code 2014 was

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:58,340
developing the Debian web RTC portal

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,780
before I start just a sort of preface

00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:04,170
I'd like to ask anyone who would like to

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:07,590
demo the the portal J's communicator at

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,500
RT C TV Norg basically anyone with an

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,720
RTC Debian org account can demo this

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,910
however your passwords may have been

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,120
changed recently so if you haven't

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:20,760
updated them since January if you access

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,410
DB Debian org you should change your

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,210
pastor all take like 30 seconds this is

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,990
if you want to go ahead and start

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:30,840
checking it out during my presentation

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:35,910
that said so is everyone here familiar

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:38,730
with what web RTC is more or less blue

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,000
so mark all right well web RTC it

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,610
enables browsers to perform real-time

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,370
communication using a very simple

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,020
JavaScript API what's cool about this

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,750
about this browser to browser

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,870
communication one is that it's really

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:58,260
high performance low latency and also

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,730
it's a lot safer because you don't need

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,520
to install anything you don't need to

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,430
use a plug-in download anything so and

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,620
by standard it uses the secure real-time

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,750
transportation protocol so I've seen it

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:15,110
being heralded as like the most secure

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:15,110
alternative for voice over IP yes

00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:29,230
are you talking about speech yeah okay

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:31,390
thank you all right well that's the very

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,050
high-level explanation of what WebRTC is

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:37,120
being used for it so James communicator

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,370
is what I've been working on it's a web

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,800
app that's used for sip communication

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:45,550
it's developed entirely in html5 and

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,779
JavaScript and we use the the J's stack

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,790
so Jo sip is a JavaScript library that

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:55,150
implements the sip WebSocket transport

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,040
so to use J's communicator you're going

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,400
to need a server with a sip proxy that

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,550
supports WebSocket transportation an

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,940
example of this not here is camellia

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:10,060
also reciprocate which is very easy to

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,310
install in any Debian system so james

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,510
communicator right now it's being used

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:19,300
like I said at RTC Debian org a very

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,100
light modified version in free phone box

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,740
net there you don't even need to login

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,570
and it's only used for calls there's a

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,330
Drupal palette plug-in for any Drupal

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,730
site and recently I wrote an ex-couple

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,400
extension for J's communicator which

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,160
shows how easy it is to integrate James

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:40,360
communicator into another web app or web

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,000
page so what's so special about James

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,640
communicator in my opinion it's that is

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,580
so simple J's communicator is modular

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,430
it's very easy to integrate with another

00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,650
product with another application which I

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,950
tried recently and it turned out it was

00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,360
easier than I even I had thought this is

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,040
my recipe for setting up J's

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,740
communicator it's really quite simple

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,500
you need a web browser with RTC support

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,400
that's advocated as chrome Chrome

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,200
Firefox and opera so chromium I've

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,250
tested chromium chromium seem to work

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,200
fine iceweasel we've been having a bit

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,650
of trouble so if anyone wants to demo it

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,810
use chromium not iceweasel if you can

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,430
I'll explain later

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,529
there are a few JavaScript libraries

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,810
that you need to have

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,959
server all of these JavaScript libraries

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,449
of jQuery jQuery UI are better there are

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,829
already packages on Debian however for

00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:37,410
people who aren't using the Debian

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:40,680
platform I did write a script to be able

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,480
to grab this third-party javascript so

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,879
you need your web browser that works

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,699
with RTC the JavaScript libraries and

00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,290
then insert the HTML for James

00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:52,050
communicator the HTML and the JavaScript

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,459
on your web page you can use a server

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,499
side include if that makes it even

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:59,040
easier it would be adding a line of code

00:16:55,499 --> 00:17:01,259
to your web page basically and then you

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,689
customize your config file to point to

00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,480
the server you're using and also to

00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:09,630
customize the user experience you can

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,059
modify so much about the the app on your

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,470
config file what features are going to

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,169
be using if you're going to be using

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,209
call with video if you want to use chat

00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,370
or not an automatic login it's all

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,220
available through the the config file

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,809
and there's an example to show you with

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,580
with good explanations about what each

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:31,919
attribute is for so this is an this

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,230
shows the extension I wrote for J's for

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,140
example for those of you not familiar

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,929
with this couple it's on open source

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,570
business management software so if you

00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:44,309
install it at the NPM package for the

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,530
ex-couple J's communicator extension it

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,669
appears right up on the web app oh I

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,500
don't think it can be seen here it's not

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:54,470
well I can't show the entire screen here

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,480
but at the end J's communicator appears

00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,110
integrated into their web application

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,429
this is their mobile accessible web app

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,299
so of course I had to write the model

00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:08,309
and the view to adhere to extol example

00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,320
standards but the J's communicator code

00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,080
and itself was not modified whatsoever I

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,039
just included that included the folder

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,080
and the source and that was it so what I

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,809
did work on during the google Summer of

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,799
Code I did go through the wish list

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:27,720
fix a few issues on the J's communicator

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,149
just some little features that make it a

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,330
lot more user friendly so I went going

00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:35,720
through that and some of the features

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,549
that I'm I guess most proud of I added

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,890
take internationalization support a

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,750
while ago another student have

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,080
contributed a French translation a

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,490
French internationalization function but

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,960
this was only for the French language I

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,419
just turned it into an agnostic feature

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,150
which in my opinion is easy enough for

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:55,580
someone with no tech experience to

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,799
handle all you need is a messages

00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,870
properties file duck properties file

00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,360
with your translation X would be the

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,730
code your language code and add an

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,980
element to the available languages XML

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,470
with only the properties file that's

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,480
already enough for the browser to look

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,220
at your own preferences if you have a

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,260
language preference a preference that

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,960
has a corresponding properties file it

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,940
will be loaded immediately the XML is to

00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,929
load a menu with the available languages

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,370
as can be seen in RTC Debian org which

00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:29,360
can be changed at any moment while

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:32,960
you're running the app so I customize

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,270
the UI a bit this is I'm not colorblind

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,830
but I'm kind of bad at colors but did I

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,840
made a skin file that can be easily

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,549
modified to change the color and

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,860
appearance of Jays communicator it's

00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:46,940
easy to insert your icons your your

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,640
brand whatever you'd like and I also

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,340
added an iamb component the IO component

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,880
uses zip simple messaging we are

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,350
discussing migrating this to use XMPP so

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,169
will be more compatible with other

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:04,070
applications that use XMPP but right now

00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:05,480
it works like a charm and if you try

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,000
testing it when you call it will

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,700
automatically start a chat session of

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,640
course offline messages wouldn't work on

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,260
this and there are so a plenty more to

00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,090
be done it's still pretty raw but it's

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:23,929
very functional in its simplicity

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:26,330
so if we'd like to demo and try make

00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:29,120
performing a call any of you who have

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,500
signed in like I said to RTC Debian or

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,760
you can try

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,980
I put iceweasel here after 24 but I've

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,809
experienced a bit of trouble with that

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,390
basically it's because of how iceweasel

00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:44,270
has been handling ice which is the

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,770
internet connectivity establishment when

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,370
it checks when it runs a connectivity

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,770
check something goes

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,810
using iceweasel so we're still figuring

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,780
that out so I prefer if you use chromium

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:57,260
or Firefox itself I'm going to try to

00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:04,050
demo something live here to call

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:05,580
Martin's oval here from the crowd we can

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,000
do just an audio all right but let me

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:17,010
try calling my compatriot this fan can I

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,630
try calling you well I'll call Zobel

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,670
he'll be able to see my camera but I

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:25,710
won't be able to see his if someone

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:28,830
calls you using a if someone calls you

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,720
with a video call you can answer with

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,060
video or without it can just be an audio

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,500
call I'm using free phone box net

00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,830
these are nonnamous phone calls which is

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,970
why we didn't enable the chat option cuz

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,730
we don't want just random people

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:47,210
clapping you up on chat so I'll try

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:49,050
calling Zobel are you in alright

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,180
there are a lot of things I like to

00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,070
still implement for example if you're

00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,220
running it on Chrome or chromium a

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,410
shreem negotiation is possible and then

00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,790
you can turn on your webcam on you can

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,220
turn your webcam on or off at any moment

00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,140
during the call right now it doesn't

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,520
work that way once you turn it on if

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,600
you're doing an audio call it's just

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,630
audio video it's just video so let me

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,490
try here oh here's the the language

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,910
right now we have English French Spanish

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,860
Portuguese Hebrew German we have more

00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:24,600
than what's here we have Czech we have

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:26,280
Polish we have Slovak I'm not sure how

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,020
to pronounce that but we've been getting

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,930
lots of contributions as translations

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:37,020
it's been really really exciting so can

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:40,110
I call you right alright dot org so I'll

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:45,540
try a video call here it should ask for

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:47,930
my permission at some point sorry am I

00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,930
doing this right

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:55,340
don't know why this isn't working all

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,810
right so apparently it's calling you I

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,590
don't know if it's a video call yet I

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,170
think not

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,000
I click the wrong one let me try it let

00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,160
me try calling you video so we can see

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:14,210
if this works

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:18,740
yeah I know I've been clicking it I know

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,270
isn't that strange well that's so

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,700
strange I just like always

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:26,240
well either way let me work that out

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,980
that bug before we try this out oh it's

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,110
awesome oh boy wait okay if I don't have

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,310
if I don't have the camera enabled here

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,160
it could have been that that it

00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:42,410
automatically didn't look Oh microphone

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:46,100
I don't know if I have access to the

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:48,410
webcam here it didn't ask for my

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,600
permission yet so not sure because this

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,250
isn't my laptop but if any of you want

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,900
to try it out it should be fully

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:58,640
functional cuz I just run some tests on

00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:05,420
it so that's more or less it let me see

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:06,710
here of course I really need to thank my

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,410
mentor who is absent

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,270
unfortunately Daniel Pocock who is

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,390
definitely a great mentor put up with

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:16,370
stupid questions and constant questions

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,990
posted on google Summer of Code and

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,240
before when I was working with him I

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,570
also want to thank Martin's oboe and

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,520
tallest who set up the test servers

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,960
during our development and a series of

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,500
people I can't remember all the names

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,910
who contributed with the translations

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,300
Daniel Pocock has a lot of posts about

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,820
James communicator and WebRTC how to set

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,320
up reciprocate on your machine what

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,570
works and what doesn't right now what we

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,240
plan on doing and I've also been writing

00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:46,640
some posts on my blog I'm kind of owing

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,310
a lot of posts but it explains how the

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,120
James communicator architecture is am i

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,120
calling you again Oh

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,909
and it also talks about like what I've

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,789
been doing and what I plan to do next I

00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:08,269
think that's it that's all I have to say

00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:08,269
are there any questions

00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:23,960
okay so I don't I understand that you is

00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:28,289
a WebSocket between the server and

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:33,299
between the clients actually but what

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:36,029
exactly is the sick as I see what what

00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:38,009
does it say yeah si people well this is

00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:41,779
the protocol that's used for the

00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,779
communication so what does it stand for

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:51,870
and why do you need to use that why not

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,820
just use WebSockets well I believe that

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,429
it has the entire structure for

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,779
beginning of secure connection and

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:08,279
transmitting the audio and video data

00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:10,259
awesome sure so one of the reasons why

00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,049
you want to yourself is that sip

00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:15,389
actually allows you to integrate with

00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:17,700
naam WebSocket and non so you can you

00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:22,519
can use the sip client for this search

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,519
as a normal voice phone and and so on

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:43,160
I've stand up yeah so I tried this

00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,840
when Daniel showed us last year and it

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,200
was all jolly good and I tried saying

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,670
reciprocate on my server but that the

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,770
bit nobody mentions is you need two IP

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,090
addresses available which so you said

00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,740
it's dead easy to set a reciprocate what

00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,160
kind of but most people haven't got a

00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,930
spare IP address which is a bit and I'm

00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,390
not quite sure whether I can still use

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,340
it at all with just one IP address and I

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,720
just don't get turn working properly if

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,930
anyone knows actually understands this

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,930
stuff

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:38,230
as a frequent sip user I often choose

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,760
first my provider and then make

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,790
arrangements with them of where they

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,730
will forward my calls so I can have it

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:50,620
come up on my end 900 or my soft phone

00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:53,590
on my computer or on a hard analog 88 a

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:56,740
device that I keep at home connected to

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,450
my network by a hard way a wire so I

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:04,360
just got a partial answer to your

00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:05,530
question so yeah the point is that's

00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,060
that's the client end

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,830
reciprocate means you're actually your

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,790
own sip provider that's the missing

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,590
piece you don't have to use somebody

00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,060
else so in theory just like you were in

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,760
your own email server you can run your

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,500
own sip server but that's that's the

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,520
point where you didn't any slightly more

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,170
tech when I've asked questions about

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,690
that kind of peer-to-peer communication

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:28,320
people then talk about PBX servers and

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,320
now I've run away

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:43,030
I'm a little relieved but I'll do last

00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:45,730
call everything I mean I'll be available

00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,159
and walking around and short but if you

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,750
can't spot me so if there's anything

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,870
else you like to discuss I'll be around

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:59,740
till the fighting warning yeah talk to

00:28:52,870 --> 00:29:04,960
you about it 9:30 question one world one

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:07,600
simple question is everything jcbeep

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:29,620
communicator everything already included

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:31,450
in Debian but it could be I mean for GSC

00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:35,740
pants a communicator it is not it

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,539
Janus if I believe this I believe they

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,250
may need one recently but I could be

00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:42,580
wrong if not I mean the code grabber

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:46,809
downloads all the code you need but I

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:48,100
believe it is and if it wasn't before it

00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:56,429
is now so it may have been something

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:56,429
recent oh that's it

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:06,520
as Andrew Sherman I'm one of the google

00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,160
Summer of Code students over the summer

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,000
I've credited project that I've named

00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,580
recursively building java applications

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,700
so before I actually go into and

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,670
describe my project let me just motivate

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,070
what the project is about

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:27,910
so maven if some of you don't know it's

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:31,210
a make like thank you

00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:37,090
it's a make like built system for Java

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:39,280
projects which allows you to well build

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:43,150
Java applications but what it also does

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:47,110
it allows you to define dependencies

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:49,750
within the pom file or this does this

00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,070
make file but the key point being it

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,450
allows you actually download these

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:59,050
dependencies my mentor

00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:01,060
Daniel Pocock he actually tried to

00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:05,380
upload an artifact to one of these

00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:07,240
central repositories and the central

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,250
plaza are public repositories they're

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,290
kind of like Debian they have people who

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,030
manage them and you have to go through

00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,890
third parties actually upload artifacts

00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,920
but the artifact that he wanted to

00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:22,950
upload it they only required a pom file

00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,950
a make follower and a jar file so

00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,990
there's really no assurance that these

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,840
are that this jar file actually is being

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:35,110
described by this pom file or put

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,930
another way for free software the big

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:43,650
question is can we really trust these

00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:46,080
dependencies so my project tries to

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,760
answer that question as well as

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,650
determining if the dependencies that

00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,190
your project actually depends on are

00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:58,710
free and that is if they provide all

00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:02,760
that all the source so

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:08,160
yeah so my project it's it's a maven

00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:10,260
plug-in and what it does instead of

00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,730
actually downloading these dependencies

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,580
it downloads a source for the

00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,440
dependencies actually and builds them so

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:20,720
let me just tell you how a little bit

00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:24,570
how it works essentially it takes this

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,120
it gets the pom file this make file it

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:32,160
and from this it's able to build this

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,240
artifact graph so from here you can you

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,560
create the graph of all the bill

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,480
dependencies all the compiled

00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,950
emergencies all the pretty much

00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,750
everything you need to actually build

00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:47,430
the project and and then tries to build

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,230
it obviously you may not want to

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,270
actually build everything in the project

00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,650
for example the build plugins you may

00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:59,550
not want to build so you can obviously

00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:03,510
ignore them but the choice is yours the

00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:04,500
plugin is configurable and of course

00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,910
once you have that graph you can

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,270
obviously just try and build it build

00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:13,880
the actual project so building a script

00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,880
the actual project you need source

00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,630
yeah

00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:00,850
say for example the behind in the

00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,450
defecation wall or you don't have access

00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:08,280
or through bus parade the artifact is so

00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,280
old and the cluster doesn't exist

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:31,380
the other potential solution is getting

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:37,490
these sources these are kind of like jar

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:37,490
files they contain most of the sources

00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:58,980
that we distribute office source there's

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:04,400
a lot of recent anus we saw the gemenon

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,400
used for building their jammies

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:28,490
what is that my my

00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:41,859
a minute buzzer your cousin actually use

00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:41,859
that to continue so you make this

00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,830
in some cases

00:37:52,450 --> 00:38:19,390
this source information from sources

00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:28,180
I have

00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,990
yeah

00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:32,400
so I took the dr. container containing

00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:39,050
Nexus and Jamis and I tried actually

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,050
built a particular song

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:07,950
so this next census is set up to clone

00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:13,140
or near the national public repository

00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:13,140
so we can see here that it is actually

00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:44,860
so 10 rates running Jenkins I have to

00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:48,580
build one of these for my club won't be

00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:54,550
so this is long and the other is for

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:59,640
this actual now what I've done here I

00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,640
mean it's comical but also

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,950
there

00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,160
so that was a message myself and ice

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,300
actually grabbed this message pull it

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:10,490
and if you go back to the home page

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:12,020
you'll see that they're built so what

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,630
I've done it configure this bill to

00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,660
actually find that message create this

00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:21,010
build and kick it off and what it's on

00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:25,240
it's actually built and his fancy so

00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,240
there are own dependencies there

00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,390
fine that's wrong

00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:57,869
we go back here and trying to know that

00:42:54,109 --> 00:43:02,190
it should work but of course it doesn't

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:05,029
because there's there is the testability

00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,029
that is

00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:14,260
rather one of the tests that actually

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,490
should work doesn't actually work on

00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,490
this versus

00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,620
so there's a couple failures there but

00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:39,840
in general this type of his maker

00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:45,300
actually the only crazy part of - come

00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:48,740
on the source is it works in most cases

00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:57,930
with LC to rebuild the site in

00:43:48,740 --> 00:44:01,260
semi-successful founded on this larger

00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:03,900
projects like our larger question a huge

00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:09,820
dependency together not as successful

00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:11,560
because various

00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:16,210
there's always a little blue card system

00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:31,560
at trying to make all them run the same

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:31,560
rate is very there are so here I'm just

00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:39,900
so the plug he really had is able to

00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:43,229
create an impossible but it's managed to

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:46,769
do so one of the future that I'm looking

00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:51,299
to the future is actually one of those

00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:56,180
artifacts to be some other in this case

00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:56,180
I the next cell you deploy the Nexus

00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:33,859
there is no way to ensure its

00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:36,559
authenticity so how is that true means

00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:39,619
you for example you have a mement repo

00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:44,230
you understand a sharp-eyed associated

00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:44,230
with to authenticate desire

00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:57,420
- surely there's no beer has it not

00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:23,109
I saw in the poem that we are using the

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,650
version control system to get the surf

00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:28,540
right and is there a way for maven

00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:33,119
repository to include also the source

00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,119
code and maybe pull it from there

00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:04,650
boss hears help you have to do something

00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,650
extra

00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:27,860
so we still have time for questions so

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:27,860
is there any more question well thanks

00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:43,310
so while Kumar sets up he will talk to

00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,310
us about so

00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:00,390
hello

00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:54,490
so there we go hello I'm going to give

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,730
presentation on Little Debbie that is

00:48:54,490 --> 00:49:02,799
running Debian on Android so the basic

00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:06,040
principle is that we can run Debian OS

00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:08,950
or Debian us on Android using CH row

00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:12,130
after that the Debian can start its own

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,990
services like SSH samba and all these

00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:18,640
services are accessible through Android

00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:21,490
also example if you start open SSS in

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,730
Debian then after that you can access

00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:27,430
the you can add directly to SSH using

00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:32,799
phone's IP but actually you will go

00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:35,380
inside the Debian shell but like as an

00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:38,619
example you can you cannot distinguish

00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,480
between the services by far you cannot

00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:42,329
distinguish services started by Android

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,430
or Debian you can access through

00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:49,000
external world also or even Android can

00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:51,460
access the Debian services so it's

00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,119
important parts are installing Debian

00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:58,589
starting deviants topping the window for

00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,380
installation we create an image file and

00:49:58,589 --> 00:50:04,630
after that we create Linux and Android

00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,809
mount point so that the debris in itself

00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:10,869
can access the slash data ID card and

00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:14,020
all those stuff after that we do

00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:19,240
bootstrap Debian root FS from the Debian

00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:23,410
servers so and after that we set up the

00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:25,869
stop scripts because if Debian tried to

00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:27,880
halt the system then actually it sends a

00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:30,640
whole signal to Android also so I

00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,530
Android also shut down so we have to set

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,809
up stop script in such a way that only

00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:39,069
the Debian services are stopped not the

00:50:34,809 --> 00:50:42,250
Android services and for starting we

00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:47,230
first mount the image file after that we

00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:50,650
mount all the Debian devices in Android

00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:53,230
devices and Debian and we directly to

00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:57,280
the CS root and start the basic services

00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:59,830
which we need for stopping we just stop

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,110
all the Debian processes we

00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,840
check if there is any open files in the

00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:07,540
Debian and we are unmount although

00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:34,920
Android devices and we unmount the image

00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:34,920
file so like hello

00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:43,390
with this we check whether the image is

00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:47,190
validated or not using our calculating

00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:51,910
its checksum before starting the image

00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:54,100
with this option we can install the

00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:58,720
Debian directly inside the data

00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:00,850
partition so that it's not we don't have

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,720
to depend upon mounting of the sdcard

00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:07,510
and we don't have to provide the size of

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,030
the image at the start so it's directly

00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:13,810
accessible that into the Android file

00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:20,500
system itself and automatically starting

00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:23,890
the Android boots up we can configure

00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:26,890
that when the booting is completed the

00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:28,660
Android services get started or if it is

00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,930
installed in SD card then after a

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,960
district our mounting is completed the

00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:37,840
Debian starts up and we can set it set

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:41,530
up our own post start and pre stop

00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:47,280
scripts or like by default I have set up

00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:51,610
our c2 for start and our C 0 for stop

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:55,150
that I wanted a mobile you most of the

00:52:51,610 --> 00:53:01,120
most of it like the demo is not much

00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:03,190
fancy you can see it's not much like

00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:06,910
they say install button that after

00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:09,190
installation we have to provide options

00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:14,019
what release me one staple and stable

00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:15,880
testing Weasley and all we have to

00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:18,460
provide the mirror which mirror you want

00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,369
to use and which calculator parity we

00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:26,440
support our men and have a chip and have

00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:29,619
to provide the size of the image when

00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:32,109
the installation start the all the

00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:34,990
process the the script does the work

00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:35,769
that is creating the image file the

00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,440
bootstrapping

00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:42,279
and setting of the stop script after

00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:47,039
that we Delta star variant button we can

00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:49,390
start the Debian is running after that

00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:55,589
they in the option we can open the

00:53:49,390 --> 00:54:03,789
terminal and run the commands I have

00:53:55,589 --> 00:54:08,220
demo running on my phone also I am

00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:08,220
accessing through Wi-Fi so it's bit slow

00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:36,970
so this is a start button so started

00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,420
their options like open terminal

00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:02,570
preference delete all my setup and

00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,040
preferences in the preferences I can

00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:08,850
choose the option that start

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,570
automatically check check the checksum

00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:14,340
image panthenol automatically start

00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:20,300
prevent from slipping install on

00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:20,300
internal storage checksum image on start

00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:30,450
hello

00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:44,400
image path posted script and please stop

00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:47,970
script I have opened the terminal you

00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:55,080
cannot see it but I can under basic

00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:58,770
Linux commands on it the phone is not

00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:01,230
slow but the connection between the

00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:04,560
laptop and phone is slow if anyone wants

00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:07,340
to try I can show you on my mobile after

00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,340
the presentation

00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:18,880
so the use case might be you can install

00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,830
Python development in environment I

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,890
actually on your tablet you don't have

00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:26,200
to carry your laptop and all even you

00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:29,410
can run a WordPress server on your older

00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:33,070
phone and the source code is available

00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:36,190
on github the project was started by a

00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:38,680
Guardian project group so the link is

00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:42,570
github.com slash Guardian project slash

00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:47,740
little living and the futures co-op is

00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:50,320
running open to providing support like

00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:52,120
selecting the file system which you or

00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,740
the image file which you want to create

00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:59,170
that is for ext two three four or yaffs2

00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:01,450
and adding support for non-rooted phones

00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:06,180
the the application currently supports

00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:06,180
only rotate phones any questions

00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,410
when Devin starts up does it run its own

00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:27,500
in each process or does it use the

00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:30,130
Android in it in if no actually it

00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:35,650
doesn't start a run stay in it come on

00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:38,270
it depends like the init init process

00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:39,890
initializes all the basic environment

00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:43,790
required for an operating system to

00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:49,420
start up this work is already done by

00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:52,760
the end right it just only used like the

00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:56,450
Debian has all the prog and slash Dave

00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:59,300
from the Android so it can use those

00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:02,620
services dying of the Android itself it

00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,620
doesn't run its own it

00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:25,950
could you please go over the use case

00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:25,950
slide one more time yes

00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,110
do you not have I be possible to run

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,920
graphical applications from the chroot

00:58:56,110 --> 00:59:02,290
no not like that off like via VNC or

00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,870
something like that maybe I have not

00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,530
write it can you imagine that it might

00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,950
work somehow

00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:28,240
oh not currently is not currently right

00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:31,960
now how do I solve it in my phone how do

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:33,640
you install it yeah on the phone a

00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,880

00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:06,930
January 2014 searching

01:00:17,069 --> 01:00:19,939

01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,590
we are about to release a new version so

01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:30,890

01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:59,360

01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,740
such thing is interesting for you my

01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:06,610
earlier project was running two

01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:09,320
different Android instances

01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:10,610
simultaneously on actually I tried it on

01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,070
emulator not on the phone

01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:15,700
so it was like running to Android

01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:18,260
instances simultaneously on an emulator

01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:31,130
so the project was named Alexi on

01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:32,560
Android check that video also so I'd

01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:36,460
like to take this opportunity to thank
