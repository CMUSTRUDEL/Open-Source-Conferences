we went over this I'm gonna create a

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,650
doctrine gotta be under DEFCON 14

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:39,500
probably what is it called do you buy

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:43,969
space so we did it's unfortunately a

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,969
master master representation here

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:13,360
more gods but whose purpose is to be

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:17,400
signed by NFC like Microsoft it stops

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:22,470
our way into better good lunar I grew up

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:27,850
which recommended good strong presences

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:33,130
the Rope itself needs to be signed by a

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:36,550
Debian P so we need to do the house I

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:40,539
think master in order to have

00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:44,820
exceptional security to do that we need

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:44,820
to sort out key management's

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,400
[Music]

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,040
then more or less the same kinds of ways

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,140
and we protects the

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,860
so it ended with an FTP team member

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,860
welcome to the Brooke

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,989
I'm just gonna go over since there's a

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,049
bun here I'll quickly go over the

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,940
solution is does what features this

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,489
tables this are relative premium food

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,379
and a few things that needs be

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:43,329
considered based on some changing

00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:46,530
requirements so chin is an EFI executive

00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:50,489
alt which is in a format that is

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:53,940
accepted for signing by Microsoft it

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:58,569
performs one real function which is to

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,870
execute efi execs pulses are signed with

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,900
a key this is not in the firmware lead a

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,319
space so if I knew if I security systems

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,549
have a a space of acceptable peas and

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,590
exactly these be signed by the mates in

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:15,730
that case basically executed through the

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,880
standard efi mechanisms shim exists to

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:23,200
be signed by a third party who is

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,419
already trusted by the platform and then

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,859
breach that lucid trust to a different

00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,500
reason trust so the simple way of using

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:31,690
this is for offenders ship Shin signed

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,290
by Microsoft or some other trusted third

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,720
party and then embed deadly inside that

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,760
any further boundaries the society with

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,430
that key Jim weld upon its own

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,230
validation its own relocation and will

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,239
launch them independently of the

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,480
firmware students go through the three

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,790
takes place an edition shim also

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,810
supports its own that use a modifiable

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,090
key database so the end user can

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,620
generate a signing key install that in a

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,410
standpipe slave as it's consistent

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,260
between different systems

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,030
it requires users to be physically

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,979
present there's a point where it's

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,979
requires you to type in a confirmation

00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:13,840
phrase on the screen at console so it's

00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,949
designed to prevent it from me easy to

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,590
search engine there something to

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,600
installing arbitrary keys grout will

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,850
then call in to shim and also verify the

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,340
kernel so you can then have a fully

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,740
signed rusev trust of the point where

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,720
you then use whatever additional bruiser

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,669
trust he wants if you wanted to build

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,580
something on top of this where you had a

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,419
verified in RFS and a verified root

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,759
filesystem

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,350
you could do that that's not required as

00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,199
far as we're concerned once you say

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,370
starts then the usual trust model is

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,990
that you spaces as soon as we

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,750
trustworthy whatever it is there's no

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,789
enforcement there the other thing you

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,400
can do with this key based base is

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:54,160
disable signature validation which means

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,110
that shim will launch anything you give

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,970
us again that requires physical presence

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:04,190
you run command under limits you type in

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,010
a password you reboot and then ship was

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,810
as a password again and then obviously

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,660
wants to disable signature enforcement

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,700
and from then on it will lose any copy

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,500
of prog work with any kernels so the

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,740
user has a sanitized waist assailants

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,210
enforcement without sin without segments

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,440
Yogi's entirety so that means that you

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,820
don't have to jump through whatever

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,160
limits your ability but that one vendor

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,050
has implemented just in order to do

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,640
current element or perhaps element which

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,120
is which is quite serious problem if

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,560
that's the present and pressing while

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,190
there are certain requirements firmware

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,190
from things like

00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:47,419
well it says absolutely nothing to God

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,669
whether this be removed even slightly

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,499
inconvenient us or whether you can

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,199
figure out from the menu what it's Paul

00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:56,360
but unless you deeply understand secure

00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,650
boot door I half the time unlikely to

00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,449
figure out which option relates with

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,219
putting in setup mode that's the aim of

00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,409
the whole of this was to reduce the east

00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:06,349
of West Hayden the so respected use of

00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:08,870
resources I think we came as close as

00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:13,210
possible to get the local key management

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,590
stuff was influenced by Sousa originally

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:20,000
most the rest of it was implemented by

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,319
us at the future stuff there's not a

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,139
great deal of additional work being done

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:28,069
on shim in interesting temperaments

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:31,159
there's supports or arm has just been

00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,529
added it also has support 32-bit x86 if

00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:35,210
you have one of the tiny number systems

00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:38,120
with secure moves and 32-bit UEFI

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,099
firmware it has support for being a full

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,969
back bootloader where if you post in a

00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,060
well-defined

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:47,060
location if the system loses all its

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,750
boot entries then shim will launch green

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,590
roll caboose entries and then who's

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:58,270
normally also

00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:06,160
does this respect the specs Apartments

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:10,510
on stilts yeah so one thing is that

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,610
Microsoft have recently modifies their

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,440
society policies slightly in all stood

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,270
up to hundreds of sensors in there

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,440
require and extended validation

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,970
certificate so in HTTP lands those the

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,190
ones we get the big green thing in

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,080
Firefox run just the live one that also

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,720
gives you the name of the company you're

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,390
talking to that cost us more money

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,400
because it means something actually has

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:37,030
to go to real efforts to verify your

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,070
existence my density it also means you

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,290
have a real existence and identity race

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,910
verified thank you know the visionaries

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,440
that I've seen so far is on the order of

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,780
a thousand dollars for a three-year

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,910
certificates this is within Debian's

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,440
realms but it is a little bit hostile to

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,320
the individual end-user

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,570
that's the also it also doesn't besties

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,580
movies assignment hundreds

00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,410
right you can't sign of exactly I found

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,260
out you got a sieve AEV search but

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,060
that's in itself not a problem it's much

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,640
less of really requires that's any

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,650
investment keys also Vee sets relax that

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,330
requirements yes it's now tough

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,880
accessible keys generate your own key

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,590
but say key is supposed to be maintained

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,230
in a fixed compliance hog right spice

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,880
now that sounds kind of terrifying but

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,780
fips-compliant hog replaces includes

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,960
just javis mock-ups so that's not a

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:31,560
particularly high hurdle to get over

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,560
well if your if your trip to

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,260
organizational needs to be very good yes

00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:42,160
so a real Harbor security module is will

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,870
mr. Barnes here a USB smart cause the

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,900
person to USB reader is completely

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,850
accessible there also exist USB tokens

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,660
that effectively presents as smart cuts

00:08:48,850 --> 00:09:00,690
but the thing that we're doing

00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:00,690
involve teachers abstinence

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:09,390
3:07 departments all we can stop saying

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,579
our masters here but which I don't know

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,600
if it

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:16,069
it's the measure of tips so the other

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,610
thing is the merge of songs have no way

00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:21,610
to verify this it's because it's a key

00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:27,439
so if that's what is always too much

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,089
that your books doing what you do

00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:33,799
playing you probably should not put that

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:37,730
in the past in from these posters or not

00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:41,899
but anyway it's a good thing that you

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:44,239
can hear this in the street but that's

00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,850
more in case of if you do somehow screw

00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:50,299
up then there might be problems later

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,269
that's just boom strong so we have

00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:56,449
gotten informal at least approval from

00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:59,230
Microsoft for our the key sharding that

00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:01,690
Colin guess crimes

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,270
we haven't actually bought through the

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,410
the certification process since they or

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,820
the signing crosses since they did

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,520
change their requirements due to some

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,840
weather issues regarding version

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,660
requirements for shipment we get a

00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:18,310
public utility so the other thing in

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:23,440
terms of developments is a desire to

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:26,260
move to ship some move to a model where

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,330
the vendor certificates is stored in an

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,360
additional section it's not embedded in

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,280
the code or data segments there's a

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,500
separate section within the exact spot

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,350
that contains these certificates this

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,960
means that if we do the appropriate work

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,730
to ensure reproducible builds even if

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,500
you receive a binary from Debian you

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,110
will be able to verify that the binary

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,180
you build from the source code is

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,980
identical to the one in Debian with the

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,540
exception of these certificates you can

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,460
verify that all accessible code is

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,260
identical this is for two purposes first

00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,820
of all it means that users can actually

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,130
trust the Debian more than two although

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,530
ever are building the binaries from the

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:06,100
same source code and that if it is fact

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,930
or dismantle to the tool chain it's not

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,750
compatible by Microsoft grace and

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,660
secondly well you know you're checked

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,630
out in other ways I've officially

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,240
confirming that the sign objects yes and

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,550
secondly this is also we hope going to

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,870
make life easier for Microsoft because

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,720
they'll be able to verify that because

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,770
identical and if a binary matches

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,630
something they've already signed an

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,700
exception is still good then if you go

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,760
to a shortcut right this nice very

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,950
sexist is not true somehow

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,990
desire to make life easier for Microsoft

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,710
in general is because the signing note

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:43,970
says to take notes or result in

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,740
rejections if they simply go

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,170
in terms of the long term politics of

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,240
our selfie in the signing thing then

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,460
that's going to continue being a

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,210
conversation for a long time I can't

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,440
really say any more about that at most

00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,120
it's that's not going to change in the

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,730
immediate future and those deals has

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,350
offers to take that role have we seen

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,630
anything that would suggest that they

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,490
are contacting us I have an armistice no

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,740
you we have not seen anything to suggest

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,620
that they are acting in their own

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:20,750
interests as opposed to others there are

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:25,380
ways in which they have initiatives

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:28,470
assigning Authority and so there are the

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,990
perspective abilities against with us so

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,390
the there was a mention that we're going

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,430
to need to start signing Grubb how would

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,360
this interact with if we wanted to start

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:41,400
having UEFI stub Linux kernels that can

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,020
be directly booted rather than using

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,040
grub right so the the way I designed

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,040
this in

00:12:51,269 --> 00:13:00,579
okay so the snitch of the code in Debian

00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:03,850
today it's as follows rope has a number

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:07,720
of touches his family from Matthew

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:12,879
slaughter house which calls it to behave

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:17,949
in a security grid way that such

00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:20,529
separates the grew up in the drug for

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:22,300
images signs they refused to do any

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,910
module switch emotional core image

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,639
because that which a monster executing

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,889
unsigned code in firmware effects which

00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,170
not much do as a result we build a

00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:34,350
broader larger firmware brother daughter

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:38,699
core image

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:43,920
and that was everything movies all that

00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:46,110
code is is in Debian the some that I

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,459
think is the servers configured off by

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:53,540
default about Spanish rebuild the we

00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:55,980
have code to build a custom upload so

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,470
this sort of thing that handful of

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,160
packages do two good things into

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:07,319
probably yes the archive Princess Di

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:10,920
builds roll installer custom thing which

00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:17,480
is which ends up being unpacked by dr.

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:21,490
into Python scripting into installer -

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,699
thing some other disks

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:29,619
that's we have to we have the to do

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:34,139
something similar or am I at that point

00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:34,139
duck words unpack

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:41,060
the wrong term that what broke with

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:44,360
liver images into discs Jesse man you

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:48,450
advise something other and also slide

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:53,520
those with a sign to the

00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:55,500
I leave I laid the hearts in the

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,750
application I have to stay in go to with

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,470
in such a way that you can have

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,480
difference it's not just for growth so

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,320
different packages because you can do

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,440
the same thing

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:12,420
the kernel could emits if I properly

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,760
should emit an object for signing and it

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,620
much the same way for that kind of thing

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,710
to accept all it has to be it's Harvey

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,660
ultimately really it should not be

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:25,210
something that Mars not here oh I

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,720
shouldn't eat mister otherwise

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,410
it's answer questions possibly also what

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,450
you're asking

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,550
Shin does not care what you're looking

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,840
for out the carpool or any other baltica

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,250
execs will and as long as it's time to

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,870
the trusted key it'll board ships you

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,430
can tell the shim to just more to the

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,010
cargo directly instead of having to

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,320
launch brochure I was more concerned

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:47,560
with as we work toward trying to

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,390
integrate UEFI directly into getting in

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,800
which I hope we do at some point I would

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,110
really recommend not doing that it

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,450
requires you to put the inner ffs on the

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,140
efi system partition that's just a fact

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,190
I did don't do it it's probably took I

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,590
think that's talking about that later

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:07,630
well I can imagine it being useful in

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:11,590
specific situations just Lear's clarify

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,310
the for this purpose of getting us

00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:17,470
working in debian you outlined at least

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,480
to do being enabling that code for

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,640
secure boot and drug but was were there

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,380
other things that I should note down his

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,810
things we need to actually concretely to

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,980
do right so I asked a question on IRC to

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,350
Colin look to scroll back sama I recall

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,940
that we had a to-do list that somebody

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,080
said was recorded somewhere can refer

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,940
back to that

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,080
and what's the URL so that's what we've

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,360
done in the

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,480
well I sent in the mail for the summary

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,480
of

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:54,399
it was hooked again but we recently put

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:57,220
a link on letting that resume WCA a few

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,040
of the places that I guess there would

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,540
be a shame we spent most the time

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,720
especially now moving forward and

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,079
rehashing that and describing would your

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,079
food is

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:35,290
can we move on by various people $25

00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,290
definitely

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:51,540
the can you get into filthy things are

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:54,120
Lincoln's I think one one thing i one

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,120
thing i want to add regarding set

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:01,410
period-- up presents robbers reporters

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,320
to supermen she pretends like kernels

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,920
this house being saturday's commercial

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:14,190
buffs the reason perhaps it's that's the

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:16,860
version called that speak in certainly a

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:21,330
bit like to think bill so to whatever

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:25,490
extent it's inevitable is doesn't often

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,490
mock manager enabled

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,289
we thought thus if you acquire signed

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,340
kernels than the barrier to entry for

00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:37,720
testing your kernel is hanging time

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,289
currently developing success rate goes

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:45,190
up franksen something so we need smokes

00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:48,010
to be at best before we can Farsi

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:52,269
terminals once we do I'll be happy to

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:55,360
share our thoughts this approach we will

00:18:52,269 --> 00:19:01,690
don't be in a position where there are

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:04,240
many trivial acts like saying like the

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,340
step zero is give mark magnet guarantees

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,470
well we can do it we can do many other

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:15,700
things in preparation but step zero in

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:18,370
order to get a certain job necessarily a

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,940
music freedom we haven't went to pack

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,090
enables one manager just needs to get

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,790
the devotion

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:29,660
for signing purposes but any shim work

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:33,190
and Debian has walked on us having @w

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,590
so what eventually

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:40,539
trust

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:43,659
so they I do hurt looking at lucrative

00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:46,259
ends now I do have a son with our

00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:46,259
changes

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:55,250
for this I'm ready whose assistance with

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,250
7.10 Sbarro's

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:07,270
it's just easier to test introduction

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:07,270
systems today then once I did it

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:15,220
okay the Idaho debates about you

00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:19,630
and this week

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:22,840
the the other thing that is important

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,500
there is that as I said earlier I think

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,809
that this should not attend does not

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,090
effectively end up there I prefer this

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,980
running unattended where possible I

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,860
don't want to be in a situation where

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:43,650
all brought up those go through you

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:43,650
actively but there's

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:50,690
it's possible that we may want to make

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,490
this bar some kind of basic white

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,020
listing

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,120
[Music]

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,820
the others here's some things that were

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:02,010
effectively saying that any Debian

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:05,920
developer gets tough code object which

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:10,270
we should get signed by demyans security

00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,710
because quite large exposure they

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:15,580
compromise we have

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,580
every two days

00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:21,269
any binary upload that's that it's going

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,370
to go through sunny bars

00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:28,000
it doesn't bar button pairs I know

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:31,110
we just check with it was nauseous that

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,240
is something of a cycle for estate

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:40,130
I mean when your father days we can very

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,130
very easily make you you clear

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,310
so are you saying that something you can

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,310
work at home too

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,960
the other important piece is actually

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:08,050
having that bean cake which we each know

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:13,300
how to say toilet for thinking since you

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:17,220
said that earlier to have an HSN or it's

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,220
yeah anyway

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,080
we suck something that you have

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,880
bargained for

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,280
[Music]

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,150
the roots the regard with additional

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:33,050
police I think we have done where I

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,760
would be to change the result

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:37,120
it would prevail to that me on a

00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,120
different

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:46,490
make that progress all one thing about

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,470
the sense when we look since this is a

00:22:46,490 --> 00:23:18,539
place to be on the market ahead continue

00:22:49,470 --> 00:23:21,330
free dries up is that I'm not sure it

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:23,879
actually or never thing we want to do i

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:27,830
I would need to make sure that we

00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,830
basically just needs an arse

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:52,720
we can actually smart cards or kind of

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:57,990
finicky on the Incans oh yeah I know

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,990
about treating people well given AI all

00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:05,030
but tell are you effectively

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:08,090
volunteering to research and make sure

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:10,700
that the ancient center is acquired yeah

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,230
I'll make sure that happens and then you

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,809
said there's a second piece which was

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:18,590
setting us up so can the detachment be

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:21,290
master yeah we got we don't home we

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:26,350
don't want that funny moments to

00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,350
directly postulate to limit access

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:30,560
probably not the end the high-stakes

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:33,730
machine

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,380
would that be something new that's of a

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:40,310
puzzle needs check that excited state is

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,910
there but yeah I can make the ESA side

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,910
of that powder

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,410
what is the

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,400
as

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,400
with the main micro

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:12,340
it's the essentially a five-step

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:16,070
approach is it or sided definitely plus

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:26,660
so this consists the literacy by module

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:32,450
which is basically a couple ways I also

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:36,970
have its patch to cause the next are key

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,970
commands to all of us

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:47,850
they don't know what's in Caesar it's

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:52,050
essentially the same as Watson Petrov do

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:59,970
you have the automatic chairman of the

00:25:52,050 --> 00:26:04,380
next generation to accomplish it should

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:08,270
probably just go upstream yeah so it's

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:14,370
been a little bit controversial there -

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:16,970
yes it was not very the I think the most

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:23,670
practical action for time being as a

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:28,910
standard can to some people I think the

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:31,590
concern grew up upstream is linked to

00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:34,620
assumptions about the episodes desires

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,480
on this friends and I think if this can

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,930
be made clear is the only way this

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,830
actually does anything is to guarantee

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:45,700
the best user control keys

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:47,710
I don't think it's necessary go to me

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,899
for a little bottom but there's going to

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,129
be some discretion about test and to

00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,279
figure out whether there is any way to

00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:57,179
determine that the satellite Pulsifer

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,179
80/20 policy perhaps

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,360
do that let's wrap this up here because

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,360
that something

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:11,970
that discussion jump silicon's our own

00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:14,320
he's right here after this so we don't

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,610
do much no I'm not saying derail but

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,970
like if there's a plan to have a

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:21,269
conversation let's let's make that to do

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,789
yes

00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:26,230
so just to we we have this list of two

00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:27,909
dues we're decorating here it seems like

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,740
we've had a couple top three thanks for

00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:37,600
for dealing with getting the debicki HSM

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:40,090
pieces and then someone's going to have

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,740
to be the key then there we're you're

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,340
mention that we need to get my manager

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,830
support in this gym which is stuff that

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:52,450
does that is there someone who is going

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:55,080
to take care of that happy to maintain

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,080
the ship package

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:06,540
you get the name twice key and it's not

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,540
useful

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,100
if you want me to upload it would be

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:15,900
able to be in it sure so this discussion

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,550
you guys were just having was needed

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,550
said we're meeting with the SSS to talk

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:37,350
about yeah just to get freedom what

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:39,630
changes objections so this if this being

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,600
dead it would be it would be more

00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:44,429
convenient not to have not to be in too

00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,160
much Bob you of directly how that

00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:49,730
gigantic grow up set it in every gesture

00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:53,280
in this kind of alcohol copied around

00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:57,030
that's not really very satisfactory but

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,010
it doesn't bother me yet they won one

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,309
useful thing that grab upstream didn't

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,410
do in response to the in response to

00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:06,450
things like this was infinitely into a

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:11,980
clarification there see

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:15,490
you do she corrects best signing off

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:18,830
grubbé modules and it might well be nice

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:21,490
to integrate that so that we don't

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,490
to battle

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,990
much of the second care about being the

00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,470
core image but again don't care don't

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,350
care

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,060
so just in in terms of it in interest of

00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,010
making a clear to-do list

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,680
what is the meaning of the FSF database

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,510
and dad that's something like I'm doing

00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,690
we need to do that if there's a tube and

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:47,260
it is not welcome all this talk should

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:51,610
try to try to make sure that Debian and

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:55,020
the FSF are vaguely aligned on

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,020
I'm not doing

00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,420
whether basing these batches offering

00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,420
this practical

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:18,920
are there any considerations for

00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:23,940
fostering the story tomorrow all of our

00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:27,450
quantities for recovery purposes you are

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,370
going to either have to ship the same

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:40,650
car Lestat in or you're going to have to

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:42,840
loose it rebuilds you using someone

00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,330
else's like asunción that's type of

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,820
Microsoft these users are legitimate

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:53,550
itself is not GPL accepted from a bear

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:55,620
growth is but because it's used in

00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,300
competition it's always possible to use

00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,860
them to the places respond they build

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,230
themselves so again this makes what

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:06,360
about state that said better their

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:09,930
education so like if I wanted to use

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,700
someone else's Microsoft signed sham in

00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,130
my distribution yeah

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,500
I can be though yeah you also have to

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,240
use their parable and their growth

00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,540
the orator is signing she'll have to

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,580
give this on well I mean like the book

00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,290
is now and the one you released a while

00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:31,260
ago yeah what everyone if you multiple

00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:33,090
end-user involvements of course if you

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,360
wanted to return key if you don't want

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:39,330
the user to have to set up their own

00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,680
machine over cake in order to fit your

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:45,720
distribution then I'm putting a tie the

00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,250
course record or the booty without that

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,170
I'm booting a 32-bit kernel that our

00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,530
consultant so you go to think of me

00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:56,190
works because today which sign kernels

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:58,430
sugar I'm sure the ancestors services

00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,430
well

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:30,840
yes yes folks that's why I'm kids up

00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:30,840
here yeah

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:39,410
are we talking about assigning shipping

00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:44,840
a Microsoft sign Jim sorry that's what

00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:48,110
we did yeah do it it's it's not exactly

00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,190
pretty you obviously your dependence on

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,419
an external ins

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:55,460
not always fantasy your it means that in

00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,260
order to upgrade a particular piece of

00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,120
software every desk may need a sign up

00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,400
for Microsoft which is very comfortable

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,960
with on the other hands

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:08,690
the alternative is protracted process of

00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,980
trying to set up CA I'm getting that

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,919
into enough actual hardware the grilled

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:20,299
users will be using so that they can

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,520
boot our systems because we did explore

00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:25,270
the possibility of signing the two keys

00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,270
with

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,660
we operated ourselves that's bulls and

00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,220
runs a father

00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:39,130
very smart bright not like she's

00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,130
supporting mouse but not you

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,110
shipping Microsoft sunshine yes are you

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,379
us have what other options well I mean

00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,360
encourage people to use some PC and

00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:52,889
argument that but the important how are

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,789
you going to put the Installer need the

00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:58,350
bootstrap if you buy a yeah I bought

00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:00,240
this elf it's only will trust the

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,279
Microsoft team see how they have to talk

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,499
people into figuring out the obscure UI

00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:08,129
this different I teach Hardware poison

00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:14,450
to a lot of them yeah I said it

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:14,450
the point for me it's not does it suck

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,720
yes it does suck buzz I think it's more

00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:24,149
important with us we not make the true

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,240
says Estonia free operating system on

00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,770
Mulberry firmware the process that

00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,450
involves talking in a

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,070
the only string of hex digits

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:34,409
engineering firm Ernst on screen before

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,240
you meet the Stars the effect that was

00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,640
going to be turning off lost people from

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,200
free software I don't see that it's

00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:45,450
something that actually meets our

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:49,320
long-term goals I'm not comfortable with

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:52,460
ways we have to get there but Sir Thomas

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:56,190
we're still building the actual software

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:59,000
ourselves the involvement from Microsoft

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:03,800
is a signature that we can verify

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,800
repairs to the same curves that

00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:09,630
I think it's basically example this sex

00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:12,359
is pretty good for my certain just case

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:18,269
which is we release a lot of opinion

00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:20,819
like distribution so from what I

00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:24,059
understand from our to-do list here

00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:27,630
they're the uploading of the Shamrock

00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:31,349
manager the updating of the grep package

00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:33,839
- decided by the monolith API and the

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,670
kernel team changed them will be

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,420
uploading kernel images that are signed

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:41,190
those are all pending on these deck

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,170
changes yeah and all of those are

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:47,039
relatively easy thing to do they're just

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:50,910
super PAC exchanges and upwards so maybe

00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,470
we need to do and there isn't anything

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,480
else really that needs to be done that

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,640
has been identified as additional tasks

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,980
since the last time we talked about it

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,430
do we are done correct do you already

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,830
have opposed to so far the ego doesn't

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,380
think everybody

00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:09,170
presumably it's going to be PSA it's not

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:16,750
quite well to math we haven't discussed

00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:16,750
it what is this looking down contagion

00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:27,080
that's something that brief summary is

00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,490
that's in these urban worlds for

00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,710
meaningful security you need to

00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:33,530
distinguish between the fruits and the

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:36,020
caramel in terms of privileges you know

00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,780
in the past it was straightforward or

00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,610
roots to modify the kernel embarrass

00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,490
ways

00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:45,920
and there's little particularly strong

00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:48,320
reason to prevent that because at worst

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,200
things always edits the kernel along

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,120
disk and reboots into a new novel secure

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,160
boot prevents that and so as a result

00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,360
there's an incentive to block kernel

00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,490
town such that it's not possible to

00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,860
multiply the running total energy route

00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:05,150
which means checking for signatures on

00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:07,730
modules it means not allowing route to

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:11,350
modify the kernel through any debug

00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:14,780
interfaces or to deaf men or for the

00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:18,650
offer routes to be able to control PCI

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:21,830
devices directly through their results

00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,800
regions so various things also unque

00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,510
exactly it's really easy to use K xx

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,520
multiplied the running kernel you can

00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,680
jump back into the first kernel from the

00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,890
second kernel it's not like you actually

00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,650
have to kill the users things to do this

00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:39,860
that's it's they're ours there's patches

00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:43,070
which may eventually get upstream I

00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:45,230
spent a while doing that and then

00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,240
leanness said something that would

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,820
contravene to prepare hongsuk here we're

00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,320
try to repeat it and now our case cook

00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,360
has taken over

00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,980
that's upstream all right now make

00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,910
several paths sets the Debian would

00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:05,300
probably one state responsibility for we

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:07,880
actually mode but if your kernel can be

00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:13,360
used to subvert your dollar operation

00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,360
systems then you will reveal a twisted

00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,110
there is not actually anything other

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,040
than a bunch of typing stopping some

00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:24,170
case exporters yeah I know I know that

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,540
right now the currency I'll do the word

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,680
say this know the words the Summa think

00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,170
you're a lot of students

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,990
Balinese Ubuntu is currently just really

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,250
binaries that wouldn't love that no you

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,670
must have to speak to a bunch of course

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:42,590
I can't steal that well I would say this

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:44,260
is a really bad idea okay so the is

00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:48,920
there a question about including this

00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:51,320
ending dispenser it's just something

00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,780
that needs to be done it is the details

00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,730
of it well including the patch set seems

00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,230
relatively non-controversial I think the

00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,240
question is are we going to turn it on

00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:02,060
by default when would it be as secure

00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,580
loot and we'll all be on top of us

00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,970
I meant as a there's evidence that it's

00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,470
optional and it has that effect I mean

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,310
you would obviously not be optional

00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,310
inside curls

00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:23,980
question is what do we do with it in

00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:23,980
other cases I think that's right

00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:30,450
it just sounds it's definitely not

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:36,069
blocking we have we have one minute left

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:39,819
the blocker for everything is getting PR

00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:42,420
- is that something that single person

00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:46,530
from psi can do before getting some

00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:48,299
together so this process is basically we

00:39:46,530 --> 00:40:09,750
generate the speed and then submit

00:39:48,299 --> 00:40:16,230
today's request for something we decide

00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:19,099
where you don't generate you create your

00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,099
own self signed certificate

00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:30,239
have you do the sonic request use

00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:33,929
Evanescence and requires you to get it

00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:45,979
easy search from its ascend mu uploads

00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:51,899
the binary yes other possibilities we

00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:54,449
begin with mr. Mitas in the evenings

00:40:51,899 --> 00:40:55,979
code-signing well isn't UT co-designed

00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:57,389
certificate that they open to men to

00:40:55,979 --> 00:41:00,049
throw my own use not to selling my

00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:03,059
uploads nothing's that for anything else

00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:10,109
you use that to sign the which you find

00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:17,519
a cabinet which now funny question does

00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:19,889
the existing set of Microsoft yeah I so

00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,359
the setup was in theory of anything I'm

00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:23,639
fine you're in fact for Microsoft

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,579
entering keys in addition to Microsoft P

00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:28,799
what and then about 10 to 18 percent of

00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,859
machines refused to lose right because

00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:36,499
it was not at the actual expect it was

00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:36,499
not usefully and against that

00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:43,690
because they have the Suzuki on the

00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:49,720
agency machines a that's for you really

00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:51,640
slowly not for any other situation yeah

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,820
obviously if your pre doting it on take

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,109
me there

00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:59,009
venters firmware than you

00:41:55,109 --> 00:42:02,880
yeah okay so this a needs to purchase an

00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:06,180
EB sir generate the key in the self

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:10,109
snide pieces then they would be passed

00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:15,569
on to sleeves or Jam into the package

00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:19,950
that would then the how would it be a

00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:23,880
Windows what states in this does the

00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:28,609
shin get into a son temple we hope the

00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,609
shim source to Debian if that for new

00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,219
either we have another buyer maybe we

00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:36,420
wanted to use that for this package that

00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,700
the binary they're always both on the

00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,969
hill do we get the we get through binary

00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,519
Newton and we have the shim binary

00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:46,559
package we extract well whoever controls

00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:50,069
the certificate what was the key that

00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,469
has the EB search the executable puts it

00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:55,680
in a cab signs the cab and all those

00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:57,229
steps can be done online then you submit

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,130
it to Microsoft through the website

00:42:57,229 --> 00:43:02,680
which actually on the windows

00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,950
if anyone tested to see when that site

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,840
works with the silverlight compatible

00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,940
thing those odds moonlight I don't think

00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,380
works with any curb excessive wipers

00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,010
angrily chips I kind of figure it as a

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,110
thought I'd ask

00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,030
it also in our experience can't even be

00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:19,930
running a virtualized instance of

00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:22,180
Windows so far as we've been able to

00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,640
determine Ras team at a particular or

00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,350
silverlight in application doesn't

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,940
because silverlight in general seems to

00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:33,520
be for the purpose of solution shows

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:35,500
that don't work okay there could be

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,880
enough to talk with windows on the part

00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:44,320
of our IT team that's not a sadness

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:47,680
he'll be selected yeah so the DISA

00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:50,620
obtains a TV cert and generates the key

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,270
and self-signed cert is that clear that

00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:56,350
DF say it's going to do that versus that

00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:58,000
the key manager role of course that in

00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,040
dispute is that what day is ready top

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,750
another DSA would de facto being

00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,490
controlled the key to the management of

00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,770
hardware directed to so make sense

00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,930
reason have a second massive action so

00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:11,320
then someone who do say would also be

00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:14,550
doing the extraction excited is there

00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,550
anyone you to the two level

00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,690
so we use the mood we have a two-level

00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:30,609
set up certain arcs we have something

00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:33,420
which is kept supplying but not

00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:33,420
that's fine

00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,450
an operational

00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:42,210
pretty nice on this right so I mean the

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,790
reason doves my understanding of the

00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,990
motivation for that I thought that I

00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,840
remember to being that we were

00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:50,490
interested in being able to revoke a

00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:53,430
figure of signatures we've done without

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,720
getting to go through Microsoft the

00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,060
actual implementation of that is

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,180
somewhat questionable do the fact that

00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,370
we don't have the same process for

00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:04,550
revocation propagation for Microsoft

00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,550
house

00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:17,960
I don't know how do we haven't we

00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,730
haven't used it as an unusual case where

00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,560
that is the fact that the fact that we

00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,990
cannot write to DDX means that you

00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,540
cannot that the way you get around this

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:29,930
is by simply grabbing an older version

00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:33,050
ship or whatever so we can certainly

00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,510
provide you with the procedure that is

00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:38,650
too generous

00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:43,450
all markets know about

00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:49,029
of us it's time to reduce repulsive but

00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:52,710
I mean when you already have just it was

00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:52,710
suddenly not especially straight

00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:59,250
so we'll get that to talk talk I don't

00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:09,569
mean to put you on the spot but are you

00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:11,720
make sure as the BSA person put your

00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:11,720
name down

00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,160
what happy was that to be able to

00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:23,990
we have an understanding of what's

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,990
needed we've got a backstory tasks yeah

00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,990
yeah

00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,300
it would be nice

00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,910
we're not been delayed

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,910
No

00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:36,550
two gold a comment that we should have

00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:41,040
to that we should then we'll be able to

00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:45,060
get working

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,060
I will be

00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:58,960
so won't those

00:47:56,010 --> 00:48:00,460
clearly I commit to making sure that way

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,130
you've already done this anyway before

00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:08,710
so we include the works throughout there

00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:10,210
are tears simple approach plans

00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:14,680
you can expect them to be awkward

00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:18,850
yes we do like not at least in the other

00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,170
