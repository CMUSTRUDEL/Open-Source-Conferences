I am Brian this is the ball for auditor

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:21,180
and Trademark right now I'm the only

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:27,599
wealth we have to trade auditor members

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:30,330
here Martin is here and myself is

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,500
everyone familiar with auditor team's

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:38,309
role in Debian so basically you can

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:43,350
think of like controllers for the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:52,050
project keeping track of assets and both

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:53,820
financial and non Angela assets I got

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,340
involved because I'm also involved in

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,859
the trade mark team and was tracking

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,609
down domain names and trademarks and

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:08,729
they kind of fed into join the auditor

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:16,830
team you can read on the screen some of

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:18,299
the tasks were responsible for and so

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,189
what are the things so it was a

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,689
delegation actually was from Jacques in

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,020
2010 one of the things that is like

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,270
envisioned that at this point was

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,630
doesn't work

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,899
did it work okay so one of the things

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,460
that Zack envisioned at the time was

00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:40,100
public reports on a regular basis about

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,860
Vivian financial status we are clearly

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,420
not there yet so the negation even said

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:49,820
that the reporting frequency we are

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:53,570
looking for is monastry so but yeah

00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:56,479
that's basically the long-term goal

00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,020
would be to be able to have monthly

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,649
reporting which means that most of most

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:11,810
of the work should be mostly automated

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:14,239
that's the element what we have know so

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,970
sorry from my point of view I think the

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,580
one thing that where we have quite a lot

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,590
of work to do is structuring

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,660
communications we are with about first

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:29,630
aid organizations so we have four plus

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,989
one trusted organizations currently plus

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:37,850
one is vegan CH which is not just the

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:40,340
organization I did you by 29th of August

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:47,090
we get provides that progress will be

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:49,370
made on that and yes I think that a lot

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:55,820
of work to do on improving the way we

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:58,760
talk to gos in terms of total files okay

00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:05,650
so we've put together a list of what

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,650
we're currently working on and we so

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,260
they're currently the Debian donations

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,420
page is a little convoluted to actually

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,400
get to make a donation it involves a

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:22,100
number of clicks there's an open bug on

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:25,250
that I that's on my to-do list if

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:30,230
anybody wants to help I'm I'd welcome

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,760
help so there's this is a larger the

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,319
next one if you look on line 26

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,090
rationalised Debian's approach to

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,040
donations hardware donations partners

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,300
sponsorship right now it's all kind of

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,210
separate things and we recognize our

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,490
partners and sponsors separately within

00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:49,780
contextually there's no kind of umbrella

00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,760
of this organization is backing Debian

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,400
no matter how they're doing it so we

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,410
don't have that yet and I think it it

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,880
would be long-term a good approach to

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:02,590
working with third parties and that the

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,900
next bullet kind of ties into that as

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,140
well it's kind of like coordinate how we

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,250
talk with our sponsors like having more

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:15,430
coordinated fundraising efforts

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:18,040
so another action is in this kind of

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,920
ties in with making donations easier is

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,800
working with SPI to enable donations via

00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:29,050
PayPal there was a long discussion late

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:32,200
last year with SPI members and it was

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,850
kind of agreed that if we follow a

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:39,610
certain set of conditions that they'd be

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:43,030
ok if you know SPI could enable PayPal

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,560
donations for member organizations one

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,669
of the things we wanted was a little

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,680
more control over that process so we

00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:53,140
would be having a separate bank account

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,650
tied to a PayPal sub-account and things

00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:01,960
like that but that's going to take some

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:04,730
work doing the royalty scheme could you

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,970
talk about that yes so that's a

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,310
an editor published a debian book and

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,130
they are interested in setting up a

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,260
virtual check what they asked for is a

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,330
mention of the book of the billion

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,930
website which we already offer to all

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,120
books about Debian and based on well if

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,490
we do that which is easy to do there

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,280
they agree to give no small percentage

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,210
of reading you from from the book but

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,220
it's really small percentage so we have

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,170
documents to feel about that I don't

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,910
think that's particularly urgent but

00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,600
still if someone should do it at some

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,610
point so last point is actually linked

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,520
well you can talk about two entities

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,160
when you as a one doing ok so we were

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,110
kind of at some point we were wondering

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,300
if it would be legal to accept

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,700
cryptocurrency donations or if it is

00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,200
legal how to go about it and we talked

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:05,150
to s FLC who's our legal advisors

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,770
through SBI and originally they kind of

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,180
didn't get back to us but it looks like

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,680
the laws have been clarified in the

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,410
United States at least over the past

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,520
year and they're like yeah go for it

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,740
no big deal so we're kind of I don't

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,230
prioritize it as highly as like say

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,740
PayPal or other things but it would be

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,540
nice to be able to accept Bitcoin and

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,830
perhaps other cryptocurrency donations

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,820
but we still have to sort out how

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,380
logistical II do want to do it do we

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
want to work with third-party payment

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,070
process or do we want to accept the

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,170
donations directly do we want to have a

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,580
rule that as soon as they come in

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,620
they're converting into some sort of

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,030
fiat things like that I don't want to

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,550
get too caught up on this particular

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,620
bullet because I think it is not going

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:53,330
to make up a substantial amount of

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:58,120
Debian revenue so but I think it's ok to

00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:00,700
look at it yeah so go on

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,670
so the to-do list was split into

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,410
incoming is getting money in outgoing

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,910
improving our to spend money and then a

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:13,140
state is I think

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:19,080
so this is a if you want to talk about

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,910
these two bullets yeah so so Debian uses

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:27,420
several to achieve trusted organizations

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:29,460
to under our funds so we have different

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,350
reimbursement reinvestment procedures

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,710
depending on the trusted organization

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:37,730
the goal of this item is to streamline

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,290
all of the documents Oh people should

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:43,380
proceed to request reimbursements

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:47,780
because it tends to tends to work quite

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:51,630
well but it's a bit a doc and sometimes

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,880
reimbursement requests that just get

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,160
lost and then when the person needs to

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,840
to ping again after some time - to get

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,170
reimbursed and that's not really nice

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:09,690
especially when it's a large amount of

00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:13,740
money involved as a second item is about

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,750
we have a debian Visa card provided by

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,460
SPI

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,190
it was initially created because we

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,190
needed to eat to open an account on

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:26,550
Amazon Web Services the problem is the

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:30,090
way the type of card ET is apparently is

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,450
not accepted by Amazon I'm not sure of

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,830
the details I think it will save

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,360
refillable card I think that was the

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:41,150
issue that's something we don't have in

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,940
Europe so and yeah we know is it but so

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:47,520
we need to pop it to speak with Jill we

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,440
should talk to SPI people about it to

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,230
see if it's possible to get another cart

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,230
because GSA for example is very

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,080
interested in being able to spend money

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,890
using a credit card which currently TSA

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:08,130
members have to pay themselves and then

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:09,990
get reimbursed it was at all the time so

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,780
yes we need to find a solution either

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,920
improve on the spi visa card or find

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:20,610
another solution to get a credit card

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:31,470
possibly another trusted organization if

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:33,420
debian CH is interested if it's you can

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:43,380
actually pay for adware is you know

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:44,639
paper so I just want to take your break

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,459
does anybody have any questions about

00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:52,740
what we've gone over so far you know

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:55,920
currently when looking at the donations

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,399
page that triple w dot debian dark

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,380
it says donation we are a software

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,480
software and public interest and not

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,250
donation via any of the trusted

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,370
organizations that's one of the issues I

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,899
yeah but I think we should more

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,230
streamline that website to show that

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,589
it's not only possible to donate via SPI

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,110
but through all of the custom organizer

00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:27,600
trusted organizations that's one issue

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:30,810
and the other one I would like to count

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,269
Li the donators are not shown on the

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,640
webpage historically there was some

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:41,160
discussion about well if the student

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:43,529
comes and buys two terabyte disks that's

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,199
probably quite much for a student to pay

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:51,470
but it's compared to that it's nothing

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:56,940
for a company to pay and I would like to

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:59,910
establish some certain donation levels

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,180
so that we can make it way more visible

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:05,490
to to the public who donated how much

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,000
money because that will probably also

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:12,540
attract quite a lot of donators big

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,110
companies to donate money on to the to

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,110
the Debian project

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,990
are you just even working on that to

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,080
yourself I mean that's a big problem

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:29,440
with everything burrito related that

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,490
it's not something that is of interest

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:37,390
to many Debian con contributors so

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:40,590
clearly under power yeah so but if you

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,590
are interested in working on that yeah

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,770
probably reason should just agree on

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,100
some sponsorship levels and then just

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,830
set it up as icing for example if you

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,920
look at the FreeBSD Foundation web page

00:11:53,830 --> 00:12:01,030
it has a quite nice good overview or

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,030
even down to five US dollar donations to

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:06,310
who donated how much money and if you

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:10,630
once we agreed on those sponsorship

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:19,840
levels we should just make that page who

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:22,470
would be making that page okay simple as

00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,480
a problem of automatically getting

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,010
informed of the nation's to update the

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,560
page and you don't want to do it

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:35,290
manually for $5 donation because means

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,470
doing it on a daily basis almost every

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,470
day

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,029
yeah but I'm standing ok I can put it in

00:12:50,509 --> 00:13:03,379
okay so let me just add a section at the

00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:03,379
bottom right here updates from TC 14

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:22,019
donations page what did I miss that up

00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:25,589
no donations page add other tears yeah

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,480
just to give an idea I've been about two

00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:31,549
hundred credit cap donation since the

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:36,899
beginning of 2014 so it's really about

00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:38,699
daily updates so one of the things when

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,220
I talked about the streamlining earlier

00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:42,989
it is will in related to the SPI thing

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,809
where it sends you to the page that has

00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:47,899
the big list of all the SPI projects we

00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:50,759
went away where you just have a forum

00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:53,220
you've select an amount or filling

00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,129
amount and click donate and it it does

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,529
it SP a it does work with a third party

00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:01,199
payment processor that can support it

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:03,269
but it's another default one and we also

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:08,089
want to add like a couple options for

00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:08,089
payment processors but that's there

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:23,390
oh yeah so we're we status yeah yeah so

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,220
I can talk about that so from my point

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,440
of view it's actually quite hard to make

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,780
decisions about the use of the gun funds

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,980
because we have no global overview of

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,540
the beyond finances issue especially

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,480
over time so that's something I've been

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,980
working on I've not finished but I have

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,920
today to finish it before my talk on

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,410
Thursday so I'm confident I will be able

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
to piss on things so I'm not really

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:48,260
going to present results yet but at

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,260
least this is mostly mostly done from my

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:54,320
point of view it's not really about

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,300
strictly doing accounting of what one's

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,990
rule but at least I get I have an idea

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:05,900
of what's going on taking steps a little

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:08,540
step back second item is we know our

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,720
list of criteria for trusted

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,520
organizations for trusted organizations

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,160
went through the process of answering

00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:24,580
the questions and were approved debian

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:27,910
CH is missing DG is working on that yeah

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,910
doesn't help

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:42,770
zenzen won't be the following action

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:45,420
item boiling related to no I mean the

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,290
after the Theo evaluation here

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,780
evaluation the next thing to walk on is

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:55,730
actually making sure that we have only

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:58,590
in terms of remote access to account

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:02,300
weight ample for is you have a really

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:05,160
nice webpage to list everything going on

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:08,040
for spi we don't have that for deviancy

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,530
edged we don't know if we will get that

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:18,740
for the general France as well so that's

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:21,380
really something to clarify effluent is

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,340
also related to that yeah we need to

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,160
document the list of trusted

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,880
organizations that's really as easy that

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,790
just about website updates but she needs

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,830
to be done that's currently it currently

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,110
is documented in the wiki but he's

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,610
talking about putting in dub dub dub dub

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:44,010
Peter something similar to the Libyan

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,490
organization page at leasts or

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,490
delegation

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:54,330
okay sure I guess the changes of me

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:58,740
being a member of the auditor team is

00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:01,770
relatively new the delegation is and

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,470
meaning Phillip are not part of the

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,830
delegation yeah that's what that is

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,250
about

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,870
yeah it's also about thinking about

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,839
what's really the role of the body top

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:19,070
team because might have evolved a bit

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:19,070
since the original delegation that's

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:34,230
it's not really auditors anymore it's

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:35,820
like more money managing whatever point

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,160
of view just to verify that things are

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,180
which I think is what the Auditor word

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,180
means but maybe I'm wrong

00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,750
bookkeeping in

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,830
so who actually makes the policy

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:11,900
decisions about what companies to accept

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:14,240
money from whether to use you know any

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,100
project PayPal for example as a conduit

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
for the money is that done by this group

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,070
or is it done by another group and

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,860
you're simply acting as an auditing

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:27,050
organization so so so the DPL is in

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,630
charge so am i setting in charge of

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,570
matching the policy decisions about how

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,430
to spend and accept money together with

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:39,110
what I use

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:41,330
vo details at the advisory board so

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,210
about some conference coming from

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,980
trusted organizations status of the

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:50,840
trusted organization no tip not every

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,980
tio can accept every kind of money if I

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,550
can well we need to be careful about

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,050
that

00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:57,190
so I've been caught a lot of discussions

00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:02,380
in the u.s. I admit I haven't followed

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:05,470
when we give detail about our

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:11,840
organization organizations like SPI

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:13,940
risking losing nonprofit status so ya

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,000
need to be careful about these kind of

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,000
things

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,190
I'll just add a point about that we have

00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:25,960
quite heated discussions last year's

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:28,090
step Khan sponsoring of about the from

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,220
whom we can accept money and there was

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,159
one discussion about an evil tobacco

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,259
company and basically I think the

00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,769
baseline we finally agreed upon is that

00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:40,570
money's money so with with one caveat is

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:45,210
nobody's willing to work on it and

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,210
accept the money we probably won't I

00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:52,869
think you've just answered my question

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,149
if the policy decision is money is money

00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:57,429
then you know that's you're telling me

00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:00,340
what what the rule of thumb is but

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,570
that's of some concern to me that maybe

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,210
I'm in the BOF

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,820
oh well they also money can have no

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:12,909
strings attached

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:16,679
so other than what we offer as you know

00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:16,679
sponsorship benefits of firm

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,410
any other questions

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,330
how are we dealing with my big money

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,830
donations for the donator does not want

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:43,250
to be listed so currently it's not a

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:45,260
program I think that yeah the leadership

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:51,710
should have the option of not being

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:53,810
listed as grants we had quite so

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,100
diggings for credit card donations

00:20:53,810 --> 00:21:00,320
history we had some surprising donations

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:05,090
from people that not I didn't know them

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:08,120
so because so edit our and auditors team

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,760
the DPL get notifications of quick a

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,790
donation so they are aware of wisdom

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,440
eighty I can add there has been a

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:20,030
history of anonymous donations in the

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,320
past but not very large ones and they

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,400
typically are dealt with the

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,400
case-by-case basis

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:39,280
so okay so yeah so basically the that's

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:44,050
two buffs in one the first source first

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:47,850
off is about bodytalk so if I know other

00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,850
questioners we can move to trademark

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:56,860
Pokemon so okay so I'm also on the

00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,500
trademark team the other two members of

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:06,010
the trainer team are not here

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:08,080
unfortunately but we'll just the Debian

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:11,980
word mark is a registered trademark in

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,590
the United States and it's also extended

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,820
to international coverage of the Madrid

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:23,860
Protocol in I'm gonna have to say this

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:30,010
rememory but the e basically the Europe

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:35,020
oh sure I think Japan China and the UK

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:42,580
or the other three yeah you full

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:44,440
coverage yeah so currently our job is

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:49,290
basically any questions about the

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,700
trademark Debian itself we field email

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,520
questions typically the questions are

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,140
hey can I use your trademark to say

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,300
Debian is cool you know or something

00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,980
like that or a lot of the trademarks are

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,120
covered under existing trademark policy

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,650
under what it's allowed there's a

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,950
section one is allowed what isn't

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,930
allowed we a lot we have a fairly

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,940
liberal term our policy that allows

00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,760
people to make t-shirts hats

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:17,740
whatever paraphernalia they want with

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,990
Debian branded you can use it in you

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,000
know fair use Debian is an operating

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:27,080
system based on the Linux kernel level

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:31,909
of however I do not

00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:34,009
and it's pretty much good what isn't

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:36,259
allowed if I recall the main thing that

00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:41,659
isn't around is you can't use Debian in

00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:44,600
your domain name and we are formulating

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:47,480
one of our to do this is to define

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:52,220
policies for handling these domain names

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,649
we kind of have some working on some in

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,690
informal rules of thumbs of how to

00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:59,239
handle basically if it's not allowed you

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,359
have to ask so that's that what the

00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:04,940
policy says both when people ask we're

00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:10,820
still sorting out what the answers are

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:13,070
like if it's Debian dot whatever do we

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,309
even allow those to be held by anybody

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:21,440
but a trusted organization of Debian we

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:23,950
have approved certain things like Debian

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,950
fan not literally but Debian fanclub

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:29,749
Europe comm or something like that

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:33,320
there's some conditions that go with it

00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:38,049
you have to agree that this is a limited

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:41,090
license and you have to display the SPI

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:47,559
at SPI owns the trademark and things

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,559
like that but if you're if you have any

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:59,169
currently the so in a recent achievement

00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:01,600
we do have a the logo under registration

00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:04,610
domestically in the United States

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,120
there's some further work that needs to

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:10,490
be done there before we can go from it

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,679
Madrid Protocol protection but do do you

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,200
understand that because it is a somewhat

00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,379
well-known marked we do have common law

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,470
protection in most jurisdictions that

00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:29,360
recognize Madrid Protocol

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:32,419
so right now the trademark team is an

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,970
informal team reporting to the DPL it

00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:39,970
has not been delegated and that's one of

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:42,950
the our action items and then this was

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,419
the inbound trademark policy involved

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,450
how do we deal with third-party

00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:49,940
trademarks like mozilla and apache and

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,450
other things like that and so that is

00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:56,149
hasn't been on the trademark teams plate

00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:02,440
but it's recently and asked if we look

00:25:56,149 --> 00:26:02,440
at it so any questions

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:10,050
so currently looking at the vo website

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:13,170
that's China European Union UK and Japan

00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:16,260
but I think there are also other well

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:18,720
there are other countries and especially

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,860
in the Asian region a region which is

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:27,440
can be quite evolving what free software

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:30,030
is about so would it make sense to

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:37,800
extend the metroid protocol to those

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:42,420
countries as well if possible I don't

00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:49,280
know how many Asian countries like Japan

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:49,280
and China but this sure

00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:03,860
so the answer is perhaps if I believe

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,450
that you you could come to the trademark

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,220
team with a proposal for a particular

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,399
country with a case that we should

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,769
extend our trademark there and we would

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,600
kind of make our recommendation to the

00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:19,730
Debian project leader whether or not we

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:24,919
felt it made sense so I mean there's

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:27,769
cost benefits things like that yes other

00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,840
thing about domain yeah but domain names

00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:33,759
let's go back to that's also or the

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:36,619
tibia not something domain names

00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:39,740
currently we deal with them on a dock

00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:44,240
basis we don't really have rules about

00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:49,220
what to do with them basically what we

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:55,090
do is when we get the chance to to get

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:59,389
back tip Yundi domain for major TLD

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:01,279
which we make what's necessary to get it

00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,850
but then the definition of major is a

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,909
bit blurry

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,950
and we cannot clearly are not interested

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:12,470
in getting all of them that would be a

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:16,059
waste of money we were quite aggressive

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,059
about Debian dodgy you

00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:25,970
the fact was that the Debian you domain

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,780
was pointing to a Microsoft hosting

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:33,620
website from a domain grabber

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:38,750
so DSA at the at one point

00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:41,930
I said talk to Stefano told him about

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:45,560
and he informed the trademark team and

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:48,110
Trademark team asked SPI to help

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,190
handling that request with together with

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:54,260
uh software freedom Law Center who then

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:59,630
wrote wrote several letters to the

00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:02,690
domain grabber and in the end we tried

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:06,230
to get there for the you domain there is

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:11,480
some sort of council where you can bring

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:15,320
up trademark issues but the fee for

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,870
handling it via this office was higher

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:24,410
than just giving the amount of money the

00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:26,600
domain crowbar wanted in the end so I

00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,310
read that discussion and clearly we

00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,990
don't want to go through that process

00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:33,490
for if every my know TLD just just be

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,600
crazy

00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,310
what's obvious a really good question is

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,900
what to do with those domains currently

00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:47,600
they point to the billion website do you

00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:49,640
want to use them for local groups that

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,150
could make sense in some cases if the

00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:56,480
group is clearly recognized as a local

00:29:53,150 --> 00:30:02,170
Debian representative group as a

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:06,560
particular CH is one example was a TLD

00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:11,420
is not the domain is not owned by geo

00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,220
yet what if we that's I mean you can

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,800
search is going to become a trusted

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,480
organization but it could be different

00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,480
what do we do about what's up

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,480
it's becoming kind of the running joke

00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:35,509
but it's useful to mention that Debian

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,450
th is the factor already RTO because

00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:41,419
it's acting it's doing reimbursements in

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:49,750
the name of Debian for some people so we

00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:52,759
will do this procedure but you know add

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,559
I'm one voice of many but I personally

00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,809
believe that all Debbie nuts tower

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:01,309
domains that we care about should be

00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:05,960
owned by TOS or held by Tia's dissenting

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:11,450
opinions welcome and if you are all know

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:14,509
of Debian dot whatever TLD domain and

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:17,029
wanted T ough to hold it well that speak

00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:20,509
up to the DPL or to the trademark team

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:24,019
and we encourage you to move your debian

00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:27,789
dot whatever domain under spi or FF is

00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:27,789
or Debian France

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,039
any other questions

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,780
I think we can rap

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:49,940
so I just want to add my wife Marian has

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,930
a great to attend this buff and she's

00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,430
been practicing u.s. trademark law for

00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,640
25 years so if you have any actual

00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,750
trademark questions that are beyond

00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,700
Debian and they're just generic law

00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:11,230
questions she'd be happy to answer them

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:11,230
