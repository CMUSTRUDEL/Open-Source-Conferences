hello everybody thanks for coming this

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,960
is talk is quit logging or data

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:15,470
minimization in Debian so I'm Daniel con

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,760
Gilmore dkg and this is Matt Taggart and

00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:22,380
so we're gonna talk about some issues

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,920
around around privacy and security and

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,070
the intersection between privacy and and

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,070
a bunch of other stuff in Debian with a

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,840
focus on logs so just so just so you

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,390
know like where I'm coming from on this

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,210
I work for the American Civil Liberties

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,500
Union right now I'm a technologist in

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,059
there speech privacy and Technology

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:49,079
project and we are concerned about about

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,570
the amount of data that can be used

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,399
against people in the world right now

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,320
and so I'm coming at it from a

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,879
perspective of someone who's very much

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,090
interested in civil liberties and what

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,300
we can do for that and I'm part of rise

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,250
of networks and we host email and other

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,990
online services for activists many of

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,340
whom are in very repressive regimes and

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,380
are trying to do things anonymously and

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,900
if they're outed literally their lives

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,220
are at risk and so we have to take some

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,700
of these things very seriously so that's

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,479
kind of this perspective I'm coming from

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,070
so and hopefully this is a discussion

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,770
people have questions please raise your

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,560
hands we're gonna raise a couple of

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,640
different ideas that that we have about

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,400
things you can do to improve the

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,630
situation but we want to hear what you

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,759
all think is worth doing and as well so

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,790
so just for background to explain at the

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,520
intersection with civil liberties and

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:49,710
and logging we're living in this time of

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,899
a sort of data flood so there's more

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,670
machine readable data than ever and

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,710
there's much more centralized data

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,840
storage that that builds up so that

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,399
stuff is available to all different

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,750
kinds of people for all different kinds

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,890
of purposes but it's available to

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,630
systems that do accounting so like

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,700
making sure that they know

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,980
now how much to charge you for data

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,170
usage on your phone it's used by law

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,170
enforcement to find out things about

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,590
what you've been up to

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,170
one thing I didn't mention up here it's

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,720
also used for things like real-world

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,790
traffic analysis like how busy is the

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,710
road how fast are the cars moving on the

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,880
road there's all kinds of data that's

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,390
being collected it's also used by

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,480
marketers and some of the data that is

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,580
generated regularly is also used by the

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,080
users but it's interesting to note that

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,930
the folks who are the subject of the

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,700
data are only one of a very large wide

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,670
group of folks who are using the data so

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:55,280
the data that we are producing as we

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,450
operate in this very digital world is is

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,580
usable by lots of people besides who

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,120
it's about and I just want to remind

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,740
folks that you know Debian as always our

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,120
priorities are our users and the

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,260
priorities of the folks who do the

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,540
accounting systems and law enforcement

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,070
and marketers may actually be very

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,510
different than the priorities of the

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:18,330
people who the data is about so there's

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,280
tons of data and we can't address all of

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,250
it right now I mean maybe maybe

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,600
collectively we can but in this talk I'm

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,070
going to focus on just a subset of the

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,290
data which is the logs that are produced

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,880
by network services so there's lots of

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,120
other things that produce things you

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,430
might think of as logs like your bash

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,930
history but we're not going to cover

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,370
that in this talk and you're just going

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,870
to try to sort of focus on network

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,640
services so it's worth learning that

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,240
there are good reasons that your network

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,620
services produce logs so I don't know

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,850
how many of you here are systems

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,160
administrators in addition to being

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,620
members of the Debian community I see a

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,700
few hands rising involuntarily

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,750
like probably most system in

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,400
administration of UT's but so you know

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,250
this is useful for debugging it's useful

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,440
for having an audit trail I don't know

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,600
how many people here develop user-facing

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,870
software but certainly logs are useful

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,000
in usability studies about how say well

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,669
website gets used it's useful for

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,740
Diagnostics is useful for analytics to

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,210
know like who is visiting your website

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,690
or things like that there's a lot of

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,730
other things that is useful for and the

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,990
data that's getting logged covers lots

00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,450
and lots of stuff but in particular

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,150
there are some details that are more

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,190
identifiable that produce these patterns

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,690
of information that can be used about

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,669
someone but maybe won't be used by that

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:48,410
person and so IP addresses log like who

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,960
logged it like logs of who logged into a

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,130
machine there's mail headers that get

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,240
logged there's put the graphic

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,730
parameters that get logged there's a

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,160
whole bunch of different stuff that

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:02,150
creates sort of finger printable trails

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,690
in these data sets and those

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,300
fingerprinted portrayals show they show

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,419
user activity they show what the people

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,640
who are using these services do and the

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,590
user may have no idea that they show

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,270
that and in addition to showing like

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,160
what someone did specifically they also

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,750
produce because of the volume of them

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,550
you it might it you might not care if

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,130
someone knows that you visited a given

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,419
website once but there's also usage

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,419
patterns which reveal something about

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,790
the way that you live your life so time

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,390
of day like what what time in the

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,560
morning do you usually get up if say the

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,280
first thing you do when you get up is

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,810
you check your Twitter feed then they

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,050
probably have a log that shows that this

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,180
particular user is accessing the data at

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,590
this particular time and then because

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,330
there's these user patterns there's also

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,979
this a question of divergence right so

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,930
when did you oh you got it really late

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,450
today you know what were you doing last

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,660
night it's possible it's possible to

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,580
wine and cheese party perhaps but it's

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,740
possible that you can get information

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,900
just from the patterns that doesn't have

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,030
anything to do with

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,250
the actual content of the network

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,410
service that was being used and then

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,940
it's also worth noting that even if some

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,620
of the data is sort of innocuous on its

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,140
own it can be correlated with other data

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,320
to build a much richer picture about

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,170
what someone is doing and who they are

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,210
yeah in particular I think it's kind of

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,580
become clear that it's almost impossible

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,440
to anonymize datasets you know

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,610
researchers will get some data and

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
they'll say oh we anonymize to put it

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,400
out there for people to use and and

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,410
through statistical methods very often

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,880
people are successful in D anonymizing

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,620
it or using multiple datasets and

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,910
correlating those and so even even when

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,320
you try to anonymize things

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:52,630
it still can reveal quite a bit so so

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,340
why does it matter that these pictures

00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,770
are formable from the logs that we're

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,150
generating right so the intelligence

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,980
community wants to just gather as much

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:06,160
data as it can law enforcement will tend

00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,480
to give a subpoena to someone to like a

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,750
service operator and say we would like

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,280
to see your logs we have it we believe

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,760
that set and such is a problem so let's

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,560
see your logs you know around this time

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,940
when they do that they get a huge chunk

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,470
of logs if the person who has the logs I

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,330
have them all they give them over so

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,860
there's this sort of a collateral damage

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,970
situation where anybody else who happen

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,690
to be using the service all their

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,550
information gets gets revealed as well

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,990
someone who's into compromising systems

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,040
can get into a system and take the log

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,310
data from the system and use it for

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,140
their own for their own means there's

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,210
marketers and business types who want to

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,590
use this log information which is sort

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,330
of a it's a slightly different scenario

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,790
because those books are actually often

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,040
operating from within the service that's

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,660
logging so they're saying like someone

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,120
who works for Comcast actually came up

00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,740
to me at Hope earlier this summer the

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,340
conference in New York and said oh yeah

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,950
I work in the division that records

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,250
every TV show you've ever watched if you

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,290
use Comcast and we know when you watched

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,630
it and we know how much of the show you

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,070
watched and if you put it on pause we

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,090
know how long you put it on pause for

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,620
and it's very useful for us but

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,540
all of this information going back in

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,010
definitely because it lets us provide

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,190
you with better recommendations for new

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,750
TV shows to watch so they're in sort of

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,250
a different situation than like law

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,440
enforcement that does the subpoena and I

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,570
said to that that said well do you think

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,490
maybe you could just stop keeping some

00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,060
of those logs at some point have you

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,750
guys considered like an you know policy

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,529
on that he's like uh we could but

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,930
nobody's ever really brought it up

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:49,460
before and you know in the future we

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:51,320
might want that stuff did you want it so

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,110
he said I thought by law they have to

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,860
delete it after one year I don't know

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,540
the law that says they have I don't know

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,110
of any US law that does that that I'm

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,510
not a lawyer

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,190
so if you can find me in point if you

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:10,779
can find that law in for the app to it I

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:13,250
would be very happy to worry about it so

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:18,350
so who might be the target of some of

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,850
this data gathering so a target in in

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,700
the sense of someone who's actually been

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,260
who can be directly harmed by it as

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,580
opposed to just being feeling a little

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,410
bit creeped out and not quite sure why

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,709
there's activists and dissidents which

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,060
not mentioned if you use a web service

00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,260
and they have all this data about you

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,240
and then the service gets compromised

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,310
that's information about you that is now

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,740
not under your control and adjust to

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,080
that they can use that and especially if

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,580
it's tied to an email address and you

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,560
know users are notoriously bad about

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,330
using the same passwords everywhere they

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,070
compromise one service and they can go

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,470
from there and that's why it's such a

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,720
big deal and when some of these big

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,690
providers get hacked is that it spreads

00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:01,490
like wildfire and then companies may

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,839
also have interests in in knowing for

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,450
example the usage patterns of they're

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,430
competing of their rivals so this is not

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,380
just a oh you know we're sticking up for

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,279
you know the radical you know

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,200
revolutionaries who are under a

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,520
reflexive regime like you have good

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,050
reason to not want to keep a bunch of

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,029
data around in the event that your own

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,640
machines are you know that you lose

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,720
control of them that data is now in the

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
hands of whoever took control of that

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,560
machine there's a few other reasons why

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,829
might not want along too much so that

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,509
and there's a performance reasons so I

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:35,670
don't know how many of you as systems

00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,980
administrators have dealt with IO

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,410
contention as a result of massive

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,939
activity their log files get real big

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:47,009
real fast the disk fills up there's and

00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:49,410
some some kinds of network connectivity

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:52,649
actually produce multiple logs scattered

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,959
all over the disk and so we have this

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,790
example here from from taggers this is

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,490
specifically a rise up example and we

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,319
had to split up the i/o of a bunch of

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,449
these things because on our mailing list

00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:06,209
server I'll take you know every time a

00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:08,339
single mail comes in it hits the postfix

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:11,550
pool and the postfix logs and the simple

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,050
and the simple logs and the list archive

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,279
and it's got a read from the list

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,050
archive in order to rebuild all the

00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,209
indices and write all those out and when

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,720
those were all on the same physical

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:24,120
spinning hard dot hard drive was huge

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,529
amount of contention and super slow in

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,480
the only way we could fix it was to

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,430
individually divide up all that i/o and

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,079
then and then one of the other things we

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,439
did is is mentioned at the top there but

00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:37,050
um slow down the rate at which the the

00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,759
log files are flushed to disk helps to

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,250
but there's definitely performance

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,079
implications and then lastly people have

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,899
devices that are that don't have

00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,720
persistent storage now and so those

00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:50,220
devices you want to be able to make sure

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,329
that they operate well without having a

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:58,500
log so let's bring it into Debian so

00:11:54,329 --> 00:12:00,389
what can we work in Debian do about the

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,639
situation what is our responsibility in

00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:06,870
the situation as as a major distro so I

00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,360
want to point out that there are a lot

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,699
of players in this ecosystem and they're

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,630
not and everybody has different

00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:18,029
responsibilities so there's the users

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,529
people who use the network services

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,930
about whom some of this data could

00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,750
potentially reflect they're the folks

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,300
who operate the services and there's

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,639
distributions who provide the software

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,309
to the systems administrators and then

00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:35,160
there's up streams and we get Debian

00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:37,139
right I mean this is old hat to say but

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,399
right our priorities are our users and

00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,840
free software and I want to point out

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,510
that the users and the systems in

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,490
our both our users and freaks offers up

00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,600
streams so we have responsibilities to

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,310
all of the other players in this

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,590
particular ecosystem and so the user

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,529
might have some responsibilities but the

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,570
system minister has a lot more power we

00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:01,020
a Debian are not about to override the

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,790
system administrators needs because this

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,650
is administrators are also our priority

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,710
but we do have a priority to the

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,990
end-user as well to ensure that we can

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,170
set some kind of reasonable norm about

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,490
what kind of data should we be keeping

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,890
and we need to also make sure that

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,450
there's a norm about what you know if

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,860
your assistant administrator how do you

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,420
debug your system when something's going

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,670
wrong we need to make that easy make

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,700
that useful while at the same time

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,080
respecting the needs of the users to not

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,320
have large amounts of data floating

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,540
around about them so just just for a

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,060
second because I I think it's worth

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,800
thinking about this and people don't

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,589
often just make the simple realization

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,970
if someone is trying to get the data

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:46,410
about somebody else from you there are a

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,420
lot of different ways you can resist

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,850
them getting that data from you but the

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,690
simplest way to resist is to not have

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,330
that data right and it's like it's a

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,670
super super sort of stupid thing to come

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,589
to but that is that is the easiest way

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,420
to resist giving some giving data away

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:07,290
about somebody else's just don't have it

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,630
so I think if we can set some sort of

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,000
standards and priorities as a distro to

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,870
say here's what we expect the normal

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,310
setup to look like then that's going to

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,900
actually have follow-on effects where

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:24,000
people you know legitimately do have

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:29,220
needs for logs but but we want to make

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,330
sure that the assumption is what I think

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,250
I wanted to say on the side was that

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,839
like we have been in so many other

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,430
situations davian's in a very unique

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,529
position in in the fact that we're

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,470
between the up streams and the users and

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:43,140
we have so much in our archive to sit

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,270
down as a group and collectively try and

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:49,420
come up with some reasonable ideas here

00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:51,399
and and help to drive this upstream and

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,110
and write some some guidelines that

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,000
apply both to Debian packages in the

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,380
archive but also our recommendations for

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,300
up streams to say hey you know this is

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,190
what weird opting in Debian and we

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,839
really think could be a good idea if if

00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,209
you did it as well so concretely what

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,380
are some things that that are issues

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,240
right so one of these things is about

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,440
the length that you keep the data right

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,550
maybe you want it maybe you decide you

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,170
want to keep all the data that we've

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,760
been keeping maybe you don't need to

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,130
keep it as long as you can keeping it

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,370
and our defaults govern what probably a

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:24,700
very large set of systems that are out

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,290
there do and so we actually keep four

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,700
weeks worth of logs by default in the

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,850
regular longer version a package with

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,649
some exceptions and I think it's worth

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:37,089
noting so we've broken a couple of that

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:41,410
here since log we keep a week of and we

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:45,100
rotate it lately the deep package logs

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:49,209
are kept for for 12 months and Apache we

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,940
keep 52 weeks of logs so there's a full

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,890
year's worth of tantalizing data that's

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,510
just lying around on the disk that if

00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,540
someone comes to you and tries to get it

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,410
away from you whether it's by subpoena

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:08,470
or by hackery you've just given them

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:10,779
that data will just change a lot in

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,220
chassis is this too loud what does

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:16,630
change a lot and Jesse because of

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:18,010
Journal D so I do expect there to be

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,180
some changes in Jesse but I don't

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,060
believe that journal D is going to

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,940
change our login policies it may provide

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,500
us with an easier way to adjust login

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,120
policies centrally which might be very

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,470
nice but I don't think that the defaults

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,970
are going to change unless we decide to

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:38,320
change them yeah so I'm part of the

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,930
Debian system team and the current we

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,510
act by chance just discussed this

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:46,660
yesterday and because we discovered that

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:52,180
the current settings they are only based

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:55,360
on on size of logs rather than wrote an

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:58,480
amount of time so it's quite likely that

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,980
we will change that to be to match the

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,410
current settings and if P

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,150
we'll have opinions about what if the

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,390
current settings should be changed then

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,930
it would be a good time to talk about

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,570
that now

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,910
okay I think I think probably we won

00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:14,530
well I'm speaking for myself I would

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,680
love to see the settings reflect both

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,810
the size and the time that's so

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:24,520
whichever comes first kind of a thing

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:26,350
right I mean if it's so yeah so great

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,870
thanks for being here also it's good to

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:33,580
have so there we can also fixing things

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,230
at the infrastructural level like at the

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,280
logging Daymond is is one of the things

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,060
that we would really like to be able to

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,590
do I don't know why I don't have so I do

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,280
actually have journal D here but it's

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,900
been stuck in the in sorry so slide fail

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,750
here this is supposed to be a separate

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:55,180
bullet so so there are specific

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:57,610
applications that we can modify to log

00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,820
things differently and then there's also

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,480
the this idea of doing it at the logging

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,770
like the overarching log and Damon like

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,630
approaching the roles separately right

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,070
do you fix it at the service do you fix

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,150
it with a centralized logging and I

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,950
think we're going to need to probably

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:15,250
fix in both and address the questions

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,380
going down and the fixes you see on this

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,390
slide are thanks to a few people in this

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,980
room that have been working for years to

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,630
get these things fixed and in upstream

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,450
for a long time they were carried as

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,970
patches in Debian but most these things

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,450
are upstream now which is really nice

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,450
that we can do more

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,510
so Debbie under dark holes for example

00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,860
we don't lock the eyepiece anymore and

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:55,770
there's Evie in that Lord we don't log

00:18:43,860 --> 00:19:00,890
ip's yeah is that just the one the web

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,890
you're talking about so well okay is it

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,440
so yeah is that nobody said we're just

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,120
removing them removing the IP addresses

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,980
from the web server logs and replacing

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,529
them is zero zero zero is this Apache

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,480
you're talking about so are you doing

00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:21,120
that with the log format directive in

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:24,179
Apache so okay I'd like to talk to you

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,710
about that because you will still log IP

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,020
addresses in your error logs that way

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,299
that's why this live Apache to mod

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:40,440
remove IP will remove things before they

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:41,970
get to the logging layer so so there's

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,130
also I think we can think about

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,110
proposals that would affect Debian as a

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,380
whole and I think it's worth trying to

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,539
come to you know some some attempt about

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,799
like establishing the norms and I know

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,159
I've said establish norms a bunch of

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,200
times

00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,000
establishing norms within Debian I hope

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,640
will help to establish norms that are

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,860
outside of Debian as well and I you know

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,570
like any other subject that has

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,130
trade-offs these are not going to be

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,419
without their contention but I think

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,760
it's worth trying to have the discussion

00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,679
and figure out what we wanted to do so I

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,909
think it would be really nice if we

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,070
could say it somehow the Debian is

00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:16,260
private by default and those words are

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,390
all defaults pretty obvious but five it

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,380
is not and it's going to be going to

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,600
take some wrangling to figure out what

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,669
the details are but packages could

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,200
default and minimizing logging and we

00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,220
can encourage packages to make it easy

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,289
for a system administrator to

00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,539
temporarily disable the data

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,340
minimization for debugging situations

00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:34,740
and if a package can't do that easily

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,399
like if it's a lot of work to go from a

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,289
standard data minimized approach to you

00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:41,210
know turn up the noise let me see what's

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,980
going on in

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,320
you know in let me get a record in

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,539
detail then people are not going to want

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,070
to have they're gonna want to go ahead

00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:51,140
and just have the standard be like leave

00:20:49,070 --> 00:21:00,110
the noise in and deal with having my

00:20:51,140 --> 00:21:02,179
vlogs I'm curious a lot of the things

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,890
that I wind up debugging are transient

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,039
failures and maybe difficult to

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,140
reproduce and so in those cases it's

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,970
hard for me to actually go back and

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,720
debug things if I don't have the

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,730
information recorded in advance is there

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,700
an answer to that or is it just that

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:26,360
that is one of the costs of having more

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:28,760
private logging might have an answer but

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,960
how often are those actually useful the

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,120
locks that we are by default logging

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,950
often just not what you're looking for

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,610
so the lock suddenly stops and you don't

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:42,679
see why so I'm not sure if there's in

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,899
general in the default setting enough

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:48,970
logging for you to debug anyway so that

00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,970
might not make much of a difference here

00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,900
so one of the things that's standard for

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,730
me to get is a question is what happened

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,070
to my email like did it go through

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,660
for instance and I'm wondering and the

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,850
logs really are useful to figure out

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,730
whether the mail went through or not so

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,710
I'm wondering hey how how to anonymize

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,200
it so that I can still solve the problem

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:18,100
for the user and B how long you keep the

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,320
logs for I can tell you a little more

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,050
about what Reza does in this case so for

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,470
our postfix logs we anonymize the IPS

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:28,120
but we leave in the user names and and

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,620
the email address is the to-and-from and

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,750
that sort of thing and we can track

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,340
things down the only time we ever find

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,960
that we ever need IPS as if someone's

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,080
trying to denial service us or something

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,910
like that but that's pretty rare but we

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,700
also rotate logs pretty aggressively and

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,010
we only at any given time have maybe 12

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,590
to 24 hours of logs available and

00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,670
sometimes we'll someone will file a help

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,630
ticket and say hey you know I'm having

00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,460
this problem and the cost and that

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,260
situation is if the problem occurred

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,330
more than a day ago we have to say sorry

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,130
we don't have logs that far back and you

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,840
know if it happens again that'll help

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,780
take it right away and we can jump on it

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,600
before the logs have disappeared or you

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,890
could say try to you know resend the the

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,990
same message that you thought didn't go

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,000
through or get your you know you can

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,590
encourage people to say like trigger the

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,080
thing now and we'll look at it as it as

00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,720
it happens but that's the cost-benefit

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,000
balance that we've chosen and I'm not

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,340
advocating that balance for Debian we're

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,320
just advocating less than fifty two

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:33,960
weeks worth of logs or something like

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,960
that you know was there another

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,040
for email addresses another option is to

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,770
actually hash them in your logs so that

00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,170
you can if somebody goes my email

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:51,170
address is Fouad bar comm you can look

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:54,200
that up but it's kind of hard to

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,300
actually just look up what's what has

00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,050
passed through and that also yeah that

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,760
that minimizes the collateral damage

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,400
somewhat I mean you can reverse hashes

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,150
with enough enough time but yeah that

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,310
only works for incoming mail because

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:12,500
excuse me if if you have outgoing mail

00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,630
you have a list in a in a database of

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,280
the users you can just build a rainbow

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,280
table of all the users in the database

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:30,410
so having done this done old you know

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,090
Central's administration for a

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,980
university one of the places where we

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,560
tended to use a lot of this data was

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,300
because we had a mandate to try to

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,040
protect our users from attacks in

00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,420
particular from phishing and so one that

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,390
places where we used IP addresses and

00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,860
logs a lot was to correlate accesses

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,660
different services from a particular IP

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,310
range where we thought that someone who

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,020
either had successfully fished accounts

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,600
or had compromised to counsel's coming

00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,520
from so we used them a lot for security

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,290
so giving that up as a hard sell it's

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,240
one was justified blog reasons I think

00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,760
there's a lot of power in having logs

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,520
degrade over time instead of trying to

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,660
do because I think stripping out data is

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,610
great if you can do it right up front

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,610
and don't have those kind of needs but

00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:13,370
if you do those kind of needs one of the

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,230
things you can do is you have all the IP

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,610
addresses in the logs at first and then

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,530
after some period of time that's

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,020
relatively short maybe a day maybe a

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,370
week you hash all the identifiable

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,960
information so now you can still get

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,670
correlations if you need to track down

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,440
something that's beyond that period of

00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,060
time but you can but it's harder to pull

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,160
the actual data back out of the logs

00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,510
directly and then maybe after some

00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,190
longer period of time like a month you

00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,560
strip all the hashes out so now you

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,450
still have the logs that you need to do

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,980
statistical analysis of like what

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,570
services are being used but you no

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,130
longer have identifiable information and

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,270
then after some longer period of time

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,370
you actually throw the logs away

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,680
completely and if there were tools in

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:51,050
Debian that did that sort of progressive

00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,310
deterioration of the logs automatically

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,990
I think a lot of people would turn them

00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,220
on and you would get a lot of privacy

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,750
almost for free

00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,559
I was hoping you're describing something

00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:07,480
that you guys were doing

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:08,769
I have two comments to that one thing

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,799
that we that Daniel and I talked about

00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,970
when we were preparing the slides was

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,129
kind of a webalizer case because that's

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,039
one thing that people like is being able

00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:19,330
to run analysis on their web logs and my

00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,840
understanding is that webalizer and some

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:24,909
of these analyzers now go through the

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,460
logs harvest the metadata and put it

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:29,470
into their own data storage and so as

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,749
long as your webalizer sucking that data

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,669
in and already doing that minimization

00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:39,700
it's okay if we rotate the logs more

00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:41,080
often than in 52 weeks a year so a

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,999
couple of other proposals and things

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,789
that might be useful within debian is an

00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:47,529
idea that maybe we can separate out what

00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,600
logs need to be persistent and what ones

00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:51,100
don't maybe make it easy for instance an

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,450
administrator to identify those things

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,710
that can help with some of the

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,299
performance issues as well but we can

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,619
basically put all of the logs that don't

00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:58,240
need to be persistent but just if you

00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:00,669
stick around say while the machine is up

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,710
in a temp FS and if we have mechanisms

00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:06,850
that are easily available to put that

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,259
data in non-volatile storage then you

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,190
know as soon as there's a machine reboot

00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:13,840
the data is gone so and I also think

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,019
that there's this idea that we could ask

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,960
the user once the citizen Minister once

00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:22,360
you know what is your preferred logging

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,210
level as a Deb conf question and then

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,340
that provides a hook for multiple

00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:30,309
packages to go in and say okay you know

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,629
they think that you know a week's worth

00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:33,309
of logs is all they're going to need for

00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:36,039
our services if they haven't explicitly

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:37,269
overwritten so if that kind of question

00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,820
if that information we're available

00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,080
centrally then other packages could pull

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,830
from it and make appropriate decisions

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,830
based on it

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,540
it seems like centralizing more of this

00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,780
logging policy into fewer controls would

00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:03,429
be quite useful to that end I wonder if

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,380
we might want to have explicit Debian

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:07,840
policy saying if you're packaging

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,970
software that can either log to syslog

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,370
or to its own dedicated log always

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,960
default to syslog and the sysadmin can

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,940
configure a separate log if they want

00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,380
that's not in policy right now to the

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:23,559
best of my knowledge perhaps it should

00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:25,210
be ditto for journal D I think we

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,630
deliberately avoided using the word

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,340
policy in our slides but I think our

00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:34,650
hope is that we get there at some point

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,650
but we need to lay the foundation first

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,880
so sounds also some countries have data

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:50,110
retention laws or maybe they have some

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:54,309
NGO status right now but yeah having

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:56,290
having also maybe pulling data from you

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,580
know going to lawyers and asking them ok

00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:00,160
why should we give you defaults for

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,910
friends and so I can say ok friends and

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,100
then I'm logging what is only strictly

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,380
you know required Barlow to comply

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,020
that would be helpful yeah also one

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,710
thing that we do on the server diameter

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:18,179
is that after that you we saw log right

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:22,150
head rotate has an option that is called

00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:26,650
well you can come and I recommend as the

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:30,400
compression step and we used EPG and so

00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:32,230
the logs asked to encrypted and so you

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,190
can't just you know go into the server

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:38,380
and grab a lots of historical data

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,620
without requiring a key that is not

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,809
anywhere on the server interesting

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,880
that's it maybe they should like get

00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:51,040
more integrated on something yeah I like

00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:54,070
that approach so another thing that we

00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,980
noticed was that Debian builds all of

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:59,950
its packages with the debug Flags turned

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,510
on and then strips the symbols out as

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,950
part of the build process and it's

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,460
entirely possible that your up streams

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,529
might interpret the debug flag as mean

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,120
oh yeah I'm doing a debug build

00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:11,820
therefore I'm going to be more verbose

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,559
so it would not surprise me I don't have

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,779
a specific instance of this but if

00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,549
there's software in the archive that in

00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:20,429
Debian is actually more verbose by

00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:22,559
default then when people build it

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:24,360
themselves just because we have the

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,520
debug flag turned on during the build so

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,049
if you have a package that's producing

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,340
logs it might be worth looking around

00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,419
under that packet just source good to

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:36,539
see whether it's something like that is

00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:38,070
in play so I think would be nice to have

00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,409
sort of like a framing document that

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:44,760
describes sort of what we're trying to

00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:47,970
do and it smells a little bit like the

00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,429
DFS G to me and I'm not proposing this

00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,500
to be on a par with the dsg but the idea

00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,809
that you know there are there are things

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,679
that we are looking for in in software

00:30:54,809 --> 00:31:01,860
that produces trail you know trails of

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:06,120
activity and so these are just some sort

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,710
of you know this is a document is going

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,210
to be sort of a very high-level not

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,309
saying you have to do these specific

00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,899
things but say hey these are the goals

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:15,600
that we think that packages should do

00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:17,340
when they've got data of of users so

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,200
I'll just read them out for folks right

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,600
to acknowledge that the data the data

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,250
they produce could be sensitive and that

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,470
some data is especially sensitive and if

00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,029
you can identify that and you don't need

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,370
it in the log strip that especially

00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:30,960
sensitive data I think most packages are

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,399
pretty good about for instance stripping

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,279
passwords out of the logs that they

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,870
produce but maybe we need to think about

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,830
more things than just passwords as

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:43,250
sensitive so I don't know tiger I think

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,250
Colin hasn't

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,160
the other thing to be careful in in

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,310
light of stripping passwords is

00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:55,100
something that I think OpenSSH does this

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:58,040
various other packages dirt if you're

00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,920
pretty eccentric ation be careful about

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,570
logging usernames be careful about

00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,820
logging usernames from failed logins

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,800
because it sometimes happens that people

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:12,230
type of little eyes in the password

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:14,600
field and vice versa here so you know if

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,940
we could if we could have a set of of

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,830
these things so that minimize what you

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,570
keep minimize how long you keep it make

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,220
it easy for logging to become more

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,900
verbose for people who need it and for

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,490
instances when it's needed and it might

00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,660
also be nice if there are ways I don't

00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,360
know of anything that does this right

00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,730
now but to be able to say to a tool

00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,100
increase your logging to you know for

00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,750
diagnostics and while I'm telling you to

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,070
do this I'm also telling you that in ten

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,430
more minutes I want you to decrease your

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,600
logging so that you could say I want to

00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,190
capture this stuff but I don't have to

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,990
worry about getting distracted in the

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,460
middle of whatever I was doing and then

00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,740
I come back two weeks later and find

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,820
that my logs are full and I've got a lot

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,500
of data and I didn't want to actually

00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:56,260
have so if you're a DD and you maintain

00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,860
a package in the package produces logs

00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:02,930
think about this compile time debug

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,760
question if you find an instance of it

00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:10,550
I'd be happy to hear about it see if I

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:13,280
can take it out I have a crazy

00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,230
suggestion maybe we should have a

00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,870
version of log rotate that knows how to

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:20,510
strip stuff when it rotates the log and

00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,340
then you would be able to say well I'll

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,010
keep the IP address or the email address

00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:28,040
or whatever it is for the first few days

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,960
so I mean what Lenore was suggesting was

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,180
just that the that the rotate command

00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,040
runs an arbitrary compression filter and

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,520
you could have it be GPG or you could be

00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,590
you had it be said so it sounds like

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,860
that's something people could do also

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,960
can we move the logs from one place to

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,420
another I mean another thing that occurs

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,120
to me is maybe I want the full

00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:55,310
information in my toughest and some

00:33:50,120 --> 00:34:00,320
redacted version on disk yeah couple

00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:02,720
more hands which is going to say if you

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,790
store it first disk and then later

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,760
remove it then a backup could pick it up

00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:10,669
today there are going to be out there so

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,260
I'm totally ok with or nothing the idea

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:13,520
is good to being able to write it to

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,470
temper this if you want to and that

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:21,919
should not be the default as you

00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:23,330
advocate and also just to point out even

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,070
if you're careful about your backups

00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,530
nowadays there's copy-on-write file

00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,810
systems so to my knowledge there is no

00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,840
copy and write file system in mainline

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:35,919
kernel that has the ability to to

00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,120
retroactively least rip out data so I

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,500
don't I don't know of a way to solve

00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,669
that but well it depends on what what if

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,390
you're assuming that someone is coming

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:49,070
after your data right there there are

00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:51,290
situations where someone comes to and

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,970
says give us your data and you can turn

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,700
around and say well I don't have the

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,380
data because I've deleted the file and

00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,610
while it may be true that it resides and

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,470
some patterns on my hard drive

00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,870
you know I'm not about to tear down my

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:04,340
hard drive and rip that stuff out and

00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,930
then there may be a situation where

00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,910
there's just simply someone who's like

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,740
if you're being hacked they may not have

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,930
the technical capacity to do that so

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,220
deleting is better than not deleting but

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,250
I agree with you there's still data left

00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:21,440
to some degree you can also fix that by

00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:25,340
using secure erase if the filesystem has

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,320
the secure base right that's I know

00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:31,070
that's actually doesn't actually require

00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,060
houses and support okay I'd like to hear

00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,740
about that more but there's a couple

00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:40,040
hands sorry no so what secure erase does

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,800
is it's a scuzzy a two-level command

00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,470
where it will you'll discard any unused

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,450
blocks in the file system and any file

00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,370
system actually knows it will have to

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,470
keep track of what blocks are used to

00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:54,500
not so it's the positing that needs to

00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,760
make the decision no it's it's the block

00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,040
well

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,080
if all system knows what buffs are in

00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,780
use not yes right so we should be

00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,100
looking at the tuning at that level as

00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:14,119
well in terms of making sure that the

00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:15,920
data is actually gone yes there's also

00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:20,300
at least for butter fest you have the

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,030
know cow option so you could have a sub

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,390
volume that you write all your logs to

00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:34,130
that doesn't do copy-on-write

00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:36,590
okay so with the caveat that I'm not a

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,330
lawyer what we were told it by legal

00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:41,350
counsel at Stanford when we were dealing

00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:43,510
with cases of subpoenaed vlogs is that

00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,770
basically the way this works is that

00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,810
when you're through with a subpoena for

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,590
logs view and this is mostly for civil

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:54,320
so criminal is a different story but for

00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,580
civil subpoenas basically the person

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,180
who's defending the logs has to pay the

00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:01,820
cost and if it's not you know sort of

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:04,160
there's a like a customary cost that for

00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,380
reasonable reasonably accessible data if

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,609
so in the case of things like where it

00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,109
might be residing in blocks in the file

00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:11,240
system that you have to do data recovery

00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:13,070
in order to get at it they in that kind

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,740
of a situation you basically get to hand

00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:18,140
a bill to the opposing counsel who's

00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,820
trying to subpoena the logs for not only

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,350
the cost of doing the entire data

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,730
recovery service but all the cost of

00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,890
downtime for your service while you pull

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,420
the hard drives out and so on and so

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:29,210
forth and basically you just to get to

00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,530
start adding zeroes so the opinion of

00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,760
legal counsel is essentially that as

00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,470
long as it's hard enough that they can

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,180
just start adding arbitrary zeros on to

00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,180
the end pretty much people just go away

00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:50,630
so the logger it also has a shred shred

00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:59,630
option now since we do gas and we can

00:37:50,630 --> 00:38:01,760
turn it by evil someone just said only

00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:04,400
on some file systems with just so folks

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,609
know we have done we have I think seven

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,099
minutes left instead of trying to

00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:12,200
sanitize logs after the fact I've talked

00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:15,470
during the process in storage what I've

00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,660
found to easier to do and been doing

00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:23,690
that for maybe ten years is to actually

00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:25,040
log twice some the the rugs that I want

00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,210
to have a none

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,980
redacted version of I logged the

00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:33,619
non-elected version to temp FS for a

00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,840
small amount of time and I also lock the

00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:39,200
same messages to process and storage but

00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,869
redacted so you don't have to find

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,089
clever ways to remove data that you've

00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:46,550
already written to disk and find ways to

00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:48,820
avoid that this data can be recovered

00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,260
later which is actually a hard problem

00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,849
it sounds similar to what Russ was

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,650
proposing but maybe a more feasible way

00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:56,650
of getting to getting to that point just

00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:02,300
on the question of what to do if you're

00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:03,680
getting civil subpoenas I can't speak

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,150
for every state I can speak for the

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,150
state of Washington and for the federal

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:10,369
system most attorneys involved in

00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,760
high-level civil litigation right now

00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:15,320
are engaging in massive amounts of

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,480
ediscovery they're very sophisticated

00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,099
than doing it they'll usually send their

00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,630
consultants out to your device and

00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:21,950
they'll say you leave your hard drive

00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,109
where it is they'll just dump it all out

00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,550
and when you produce it according to

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:28,310
subpoena you're supposed to produce it

00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,470
in its native format as you store it so

00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,980
the bills will actually not be an

00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:35,000
impediment it's a good thought but

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,369
actually they're they're ahead of the

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,830
curve right now and they're accessing

00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:42,910
this data left to right the center all

00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,910
the more reason to not have it

00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:57,920
one more hand up here I'm quite

00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,359
interested in by this idea of tidying

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,350
the logs up after you've written them

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:07,040
persistent storage which if you're gonna

00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:10,430
be subpoenaed six weeks later is useful

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,490
but if I left my laptop on a train for

00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,330
example and I'm rotating my logs on a

00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,010
daily basis

00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:20,900
today's logs are right there for you to

00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:22,690
read and along the same vein at least in

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,300
the UK I can't speak for anywhere else

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:28,880
if a warrant is issued to acquire data

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:32,630
from you on a criminal basis rather than

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,550
a civil basis you you don't get you

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,350
somebody doesn't turn up and say give me

00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,540
your logs please they turn up and say

00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,460
where you are I am taking your equipment

00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,050
and you at that point you have an

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,880
opportunity to do any kind of scrubbing

00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,859
so you're much better off not having

00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,330
written them in that form in the first

00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,520
place and I don't think we should forget

00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,320
that we're not necessarily talking about

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,270
civil subpoenas there are all sorts of

00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,170
other ways which somebody might try and

00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,170
get hold of something from you

00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,429
so I just have one very small point now

00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:12,989
we've been talking a bit about the

00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:15,269
arguments that one might have with with

00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:18,779
one's managers if one's a sysadmin

00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:20,699
about data minimization the situation in

00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:22,259
the u.s. is pretty bad but in the

00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:23,999
European Union

00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:27,150
there's the European Union data

00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:28,619
protection directives which legally

00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:32,160
mandate that you should not keep

00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:36,599
unnecessary data and you know I won't go

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,699
into the whole detail of that but one

00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,729
way to look at some of this is to say

00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:43,559
well we should make it easier for people

00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:46,890
who are running our systems to comply

00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,900
with European law as as well as

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,150
obviously you know going beyond that and

00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:55,549
doing what we think is right I think

00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,549
that's a reasonable way to approach it

00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,560
perhaps you could set the defaults based

00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,790
on what language you select at the

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,530
beginning so like if you selected

00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:13,650
English we could say well you're

00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:16,260
probably retaining the dress if you

00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:18,570
selected American English then you know

00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,350
we could say well you're in the US or if

00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:24,390
you yeah yeah I think I think asking it

00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:27,210
doesn't explicit separate question well

00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:29,040
right now I'm saying like we could we

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,570
could set the we could ask it as a

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,900
separate question but set the default

00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,950
based on your life based on the guest

00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,590
from your library yeah

00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:38,670
exactly I think that I think that has a

00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,870
lot of potential for confusion

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,120
especially because I know that there are

00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,070
people who run their systems in American

00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:54,750
English simply because that is the most

00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:55,800
widely yeah or see think as a project we

00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,320
don't want to get in the habit of

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,140
ourselves trying to interpret the laws

00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,030
of all these different countries and

00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,100
figuring that out weird we're not the

00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,590
early so there may be there may be

00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,510
someone who wants to do the thankless

00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,430
job that's liked easy data right which

00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:13,860
is every time somebody changes that time

00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:17,490
zone you know so we have a way of

00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:19,110
formalizing something that I suspect

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,490
that the laws around data logging is

00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,560
much more complicated their laws around

00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:25,110
daylight savings time and please please

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,000
please don't be confused into the

00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,490
believes that existing geopolitical

00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,920
boundaries mean anything with respect to

00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:34,430
data protection data privacy who's going

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,430
to mind what

00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:42,789
so we've got a tiger net set up a very

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,949
rudimentary sketch of a wiki page which

00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:47,380
is just wiki Debian org slash logging

00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:48,669
and we want to start filling that in and

00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:53,169
we want to start trying to come up with

00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:55,689
a sort of you know a set of guidelines

00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:58,539
that we think makes sense for tools that

00:43:55,689 --> 00:44:01,239
are in Debian I don't know if folks are

00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:03,039
interested in in setting up the mailing

00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,779
list as well to discuss this and sort of

00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,009
bat around ideas or if we want to just

00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:08,319
want to like change things through the

00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:11,979
wiki and then use existing mailing lists

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,449
for discussion where it comes up I just

00:44:11,979 --> 00:44:18,039
heard a whisper of Debian developer

00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:19,419
there it's quite the firehose to read if

00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,039
you want to filter it through for

00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:23,140
questions just about what what log and

00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,339
guidelines should be if we decide to set

00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,329
up a mailing list if enough people come

00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:27,219
to me and say yes this should be a

00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,469
separate mailing list we'll put the

00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:30,640
mailing list on that wiki page but I

00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:33,519
invite you to go to the wiki page and

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,709
try to add thoughts and observations and

00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,469
concerns that you have and maybe we

00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:40,659
should probably establish some user tags

00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:42,689
within dead bugs that indicate so that

00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:45,699
we can find where these policies are

00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:48,699
these guidelines sorry I wasn't use the

00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:49,989
p-word where these guidelines are not

00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:52,419
being met or where we think they're not

00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:54,339
being met as a chance to sort of come to

00:44:52,419 --> 00:45:00,849
you know the usual rough consensus

00:44:54,339 --> 00:45:03,579
within the project there's a letter in

00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:05,739
the wick does a upstream guide buff so

00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:09,549
you guys could come to that and we could

00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:11,529
discuss how we can advise our upstreams

00:45:09,549 --> 00:45:12,839
about the defaults for logging that'd be

00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:15,369
great

00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:18,669
the other thing is earlier in the week

00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:21,339
we were discussing a possibility of a

00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:23,949
Debian free services guidelines document

00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:27,130
and maybe we could add that this sort of

00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:29,789
stuff to that document as well yeah I

00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,789
think I would begin

00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:36,090
just to say our wiki has a subscribe

00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,440
option so you can subscribe to that page

00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:42,390
and you will know when there is change

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,100
do that good cool all right so I think

00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,050
we're out of time thanks folks for

00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,760
coming and talking about it and I look

00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:49,890
forward to making Debbie and more

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,270
respectful of our users privacy and more

00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,270
