	00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:11,000
it's good okay

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:15,509
hello I'm taller I'm hot it's a team

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,390
with me today we have Zobel who's also a

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,410
DSA member and we're here to talk a

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,420
little bit about what DSA does and

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:28,130
obviously if you have questions and

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,520
anything then we'll be happy to try to

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:34,950
try to keep that as some sort of some

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,989
sort of round table because we wondered

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,309
discussion with you this is not to going

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:45,620
to be a talk so whenever you have

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,620
questions just ask

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,580
the okay the DSA team consists are

00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:04,400
currently of three people

00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:06,680
seven people I think yeah we're we most

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,250
of us are in Europe but we also have

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,450
Luca who's in Canada

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:18,410
apart from that paranoid is on holiday

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,550
and the me yeah

00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,550
various other people

00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,850
u2's we have as Debian system

00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:34,460
administrator is basically to build and

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:40,310
maintain the infrastructure you are all

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:43,340
using for running our distribution it's

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:47,170
the general system admin stuff we are

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:51,560
doing installing security updates

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:54,860
keeping machines up-to-date keeping the

00:01:51,560 --> 00:02:01,760
hardware running creating accounts for

00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:04,310
you running DNS mail yeah so one thing

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,680
we actually don't do is we generally

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,000
just provide the base we provide that

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,510
the OS support for that we don't run

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,810
most of the services like listed in all

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,269
we don't we're not the people you want

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,299
to talk to if there is some problem with

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,549
spam handling with spam Hanley then you

00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:30,080
want to talk to this guy who's also part

00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:33,019
of the lace varsity similar bugs that in

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,330
all the web pages we don't we make sure

00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,820
that the Apache is running but if I'm

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:43,100
typos from the web page a35 oh don't

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,900
blame us um we have I don't know how

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,890
many machines we run in the meantime I

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:52,280
think it's something around 150 160 it

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,860
machines in total including the VMS know

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,860
if you can't vm there are it's more like

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:02,510
250 okay but we run those machines

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,970
currently at about 30 locations

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,980
worldwide

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:11,030
also part of that our duty is to deal

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:14,390
with holsters and the local admins so if

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,000
if they have firewalls running in front

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,140
of our machines we try to convince them

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,070
to shut down the to disable the firewall

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,190
parts for our machines so we get we can

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,830
manage so stuff ourself yeah this is

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,440
this is often saying we have some

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:38,120
locations where the machines are adapted

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,390
for and they spray it's a secure NTP so

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,370
there are there are various places or we

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,590
have to make accommodations because it's

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,280
hard to get the hardware to be another

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,660
place maybe it's it's there boards for

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,570
an architecture which is being

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,040
bootstraps there are so in some cases we

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:59,240
kind of have to endure a little bit of

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,190
pain for that but most holsters and most

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,830
local admins are really nice people

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,470
really easy to deal with and very very

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,290
accommodating and I mean we don't pay

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:12,800
for any of this so it's all sponsored

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:15,530
and given to us free of charge so wait

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,630
yeah and it differs from location to

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,000
location we currently have locations

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,340
where we have a full rack of hardware

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,380
which we can or a full rack which we can

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,970
populate with hardware and there are

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,270
other locations where we just have one

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:34,540
or two machines sitting and doing the

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:38,900
jobs for for us keep in mind all of us

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,370
seven persons account are not paid to do

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,560
it

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,860
such admin jobs so we are all doing that

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,370
on our volunteer time so if you speak up

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,740
on IRC sometimes you will not get any

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:59,350
reaction within five minutes but I think

00:04:51,740 --> 00:05:01,970
that's mostly clear to all of you yeah

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:07,360
we have so many machines we like

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:11,300
automation we run puppet everywhere it's

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,950
it it was chosen some time ago and it

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,789
generally does the right thing in

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,660
general averse ok this often makes for

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:19,790
some interesting

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,520
problems when bootstrapping because

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:25,090
apparently Ruby is really really awesome

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:30,710
to be strapped right Steve

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:34,700
especially unarmed we also like get we

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:39,080
have the entire public repositories and

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:42,190
get our domain soaring yet our wikis and

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,960
get everything yeah basically if

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,310
everything can be put in to get you

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
probably don't want to do it to a

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,800
database but like anything else that I

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,120
think it we have some sort of account

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,120
management tool which we are country

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,990
rewriting it's called user DL dub or UDL

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:07,130
DUP Luka has done quite a lot of work on

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,350
the rewrite which I think it's already

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,850
handling the generating stuff which is

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,870
rolled out to the Debbie underdog

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:17,390
machines all the other parts of UDL DUP

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:22,880
are still using the old code base which

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:27,560
is well ugly to read reads like tall

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,420
bash in written and pison so if you have

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,570
spare time and knowledge and Tizen

00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,930
helped us to finish the rewrite jump

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:39,620
yeah so the the new UD is written in

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:45,950
it's a Django project so it's fairly

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:48,110
nice and well so what it does is it has

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,770
a local LDAP server which runs on the

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,580
machine called drug he which is DBW nog

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:58,490
and on there it generates static files

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,890
which are synced out to all machines so

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,380
even though we're using LF for account

00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:06,110
information we don't have a single point

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,810
of hellar so if that machines goes down

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,900
then it means you can't update your

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,000
password but you can or your sh keys but

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,580
you can still log in various places and

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,550
it also works around network issues

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,370
between machines so if as this HP

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:26,479
between draggy and the porting machine

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,720
or whatever works you get that you can

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,190
log into machines we monitor our

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,360
machines

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:42,610
using Noonan and well nowadays you can

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:44,810
go a jig not yeah yeah have we had some

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,930
performance issues with some Union but

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,470
with a breezy version I think it was and

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:55,520
the I think staff union works quite well

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,730
for us in general if there are web pages

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,080
like a king are on Union asking for a

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:07,820
password then this is just this a -

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:11,090
guest and either no password or and or

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:15,560
just a random password is just to

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:18,110
protect our hardware or well there are

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,040
services so that script kiddies or

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:24,070
whoever wants to see what his script is

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,320
doing an effect to the Debian services

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:30,260
not seeing the results directly but

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:36,169
everyone who knows how the Debian system

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:39,890
economy a system works you get access to

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:42,380
there it's also so we don't accidentally

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:46,760
end up with spiders walking around

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:48,710
because unions web interface is it's

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,710
generating the the graphs on the fly and

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:57,400
it's using our D tool and that can

00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:57,400
consume great amounts of CPU power and

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,890
web spiders are really really good at

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,840
wasting wasting give you power for us so

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,860
we kind of want to keep them off those

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:13,600
pages to track our issues we currently

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,460
have with hardware failures with

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,370
accounts we need to create and so on we

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:24,980
use request tracker on our t Debian org

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:26,630
which some other teams use as well we

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:32,950
can either mail it or use a web

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:32,950
interface Debian developers I think only

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:40,220
yeah most people will only for most

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,440
people it's read-only well you can you

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,940
can interface with requests three metal

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,830
of course

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,320
if you need to send something there send

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,270
it to Artie at Debian old and make sure

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,070
to include Debian Artie in the subject

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,740
because else we'll just throw it away

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,870
because then it's ma'am it's really

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,690
efficient spam filter it's slightly

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:06,410
annoying for when you submit the first

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:09,340
ticket yeah the last talk we gave about

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,800
the DSA team was I think two years ago

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:17,510
so we tried to summarize what we've done

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,850
in the last two years we have since when

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,250
when was that meeting in our slowest in

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,040
three years ago years ago two years ago

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,050
we decided that we want at least the

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,290
infrastructure hardware not the potting

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,250
hardware on machine said is that are

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:37,730
under aren t so we can open a ticket at

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,630
HP IBM or whatever and ask them to send

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,760
replacement parts when Hardware breaks

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:48,610
we use server grade hardware currently

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,610
most of the machines are HP machines

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:59,060
dl380 deal 360 deal 580 yeah yeah they

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:02,570
work quite well and I think we're mostly

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:05,540
done with that transition and it turns

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,730
out that having actual service rather

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,530
than something somebody threw together

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,620
and fit under a desk and then forgot

00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:18,860
about is actually makes for less pain

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:22,430
and more app time we try to consolidate

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,400
the amount of data centers we are having

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,280
core services running in so currently we

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,180
have like three data center three to

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,760
five data centers we have quite a lot of

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:40,070
services running and that's manda

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:48,050
bite-mark gr not just a little bit oh

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:49,850
she also USL UBC hmm easy yeah and we

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,510
also have some other places with few

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,820
machines but since it's often painful to

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,550
have a single machine in the location we

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,760
try to avoid that

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,860
it's it's kind of a trade-off you want

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,180
to you want to have enough locations

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,070
that you have restaurants but you don't

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,110
want to have so many that you basically

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,329
have two machines everywhere and each

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,220
time there is a problem you have to deal

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,740
with somebody who you haven't spoken to

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:21,620
in two years because that was when the

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:23,390
last problem appeared on the on the core

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,779
of for the core services we're currently

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:31,430
using ganeti for virtualization which is

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:34,370
some sort of KVM based virtualization

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,040
framework it's a cluster manager which

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,890
came out of Google and which works

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,390
really well it's target is clusters from

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:50,510
1 to 50 machines and every software it

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:54,380
works very well for us and touches where

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:57,050
I recently where I try to work on and in

00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,399
the last few months is the single

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:03,529
sign-on framework for web applications

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,649
thankfully together with enrico who

00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:11,350
helped quite a lot with that we written

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:16,370
the paul a guitar called i wrote two

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:20,480
pison Django framework so we hope to be

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:24,760
able to well provide single sign-on also

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,860
for non Debian dark web services which

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,160
was the current software we used for

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:35,570
Debian dark didn't work out for security

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,430
reasons so well so let's see how where

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,970
we stand in two years with single

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:45,890
sign-on on web stuff yeah so currently

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:49,070
we've we had a problem earlier this year

00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:52,160
where the backup server we had would die

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,800
and then die and then die and with

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,690
various problems with it claimed job

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,540
harddrive errors but it looked more like

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,730
controller errors and so on obviously

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,800
running without backups isn't a terribly

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,250
good idea so we bootstrapped another

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,420
backup server but it it was running at

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,519
in the bite-mark datacenter

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,010
because we have many other services

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,260
hosted there that's not a very good

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:20,260
situation just because if something

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:23,290
happens and beta Center at that data

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,600
center and it burns on then we've

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:29,649
suddenly lost both the backups and the

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,490
services being backed up so two months

00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:38,980
ago so we got a new machine it's hosted

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:43,209
TGI I need ya and it's happily checking

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:46,779
along and making backups we're currently

00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:48,940
using bacliff backups and it's working

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,250
ok we're having some interesting

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,510
problems with scheduling of backups so

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,649
we're probably going to need to do some

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:58,720
fixes there yeah Luca is doing the udl

00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:01,540
Dupree right as mention already

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,899
mentioned earlier we can need helping

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:12,540
hands there I think Paul and Peter

00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:18,730
worked on working on the under snapshot

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:21,790
infrastructure giving especially the QA

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,130
integration for a snapshot yeah we had

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,910
the donation from

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,920
LeaseWeb early this year or so similar

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,800
to the backup service it turns out that

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,959
file systems when serve service when

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,079
they grow big enough you end up with

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,390
lots of disks dying and Linux isn't

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,120
terribly good at handling this when you

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:49,000
get enough of enough for your desks

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:54,190
dying so we had one machine which died

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,920
with controller failure yeah we kind of

00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:00,279
tried to revive it it wasn't really

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,449
successful so we ended up getting this

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,149
donation from LeaseWeb

00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:07,839
and we then have a small cluster of

00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:09,910
machines in their data center where we'd

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,600
snapshot is currently rising 23

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:15,209
terabytes yes not like that ok sorry

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,330
terabytes something like that in size

00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:25,110
which is currently the biggest

00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:29,850
archive we compliment Ain yeah we try to

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:34,380
roll out SSL everywhere in the in the

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:37,080
past yeah we're moving basically and

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:40,770
it's it's been something we wanted to do

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,910
it for a while to enable HTTPS and so on

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,260
everywhere even on kind of public and

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,520
open resources

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:53,760
it felt with the it wasn't really

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:56,550
triggered by but it was kind of it in

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,990
the same way as the Snowden thanks then

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,750
it was like yeah we should probably

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,510
actually move forward and on it because

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,350
the it turns out that there are entirely

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:14,010
too many people who like T speed amping

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:18,209
too too much separate wishing for more

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,740
SSL everywhere we there was some little

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,110
bit of controversy around this when

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,939
whatever to people you know because it

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:29,790
turns out that EE get in the aya I think

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,550
had some problems with verifying the

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:35,640
certificates and so on so it's not a

00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:39,000
completely uncontroversial and smooth

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,770
move but we still like sometimes you

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,220
need to make a little bit of sacrifice

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,220
to to actually get the security we want

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:57,360
yeah and related to that also we push

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:59,640
some bets towards using C which also are

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,070
interesting in that in the context of

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,040
SSL because you have to get your search

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,720
to somebody else and there's a trade-off

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,240
there so you kind of have to trust your

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,210
private area what we are also currently

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,690
doing the due to the fact that we got a

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:19,620
very huge donation from bite mark I

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:22,650
think one and a half years ago the they

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:28,530
gave us a full BladeCenter and I think

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:31,200
six MSA shows secretive or well three

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,870
chassis plus three and that's entirely

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,539
either

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:37,600
and so we currently still have some

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:41,230
spare CPU cycles left at a bite mark and

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,260
I'm currently setting up OpenStack at

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,929
the bite mark data center for one or two

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:50,500
blades so in the end the idea is that

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:53,409
Debian developers can start VMware

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,440
themselves similar to the VMS we are

00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:58,450
using for our infrastructure so we can

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,159
more easily migrate debian dotnet

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:06,149
services to Debian dark services making

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:09,669
giving you some sort of common

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:14,350
infrastructure we use on on Debian so

00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:17,020
you can well help us to migrate services

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,809
or we can help you to migrate services

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,169
from your hardware to the Debian

00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:25,330
infrastructure and part of the reason

00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:27,909
for that it turns out that running

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,620
various half official services on

00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:30,669
people's home machines and colloid

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,679
machines and so on

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:36,580
it's not terribly good idea because

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,529
people will in often they'll run for

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,640
years and then some of they will get

00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:45,789
bored or they'll quit Debian or they'll

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,770
go broke or like the Machine will burn

00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:49,870
down or something something will happen

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,750
the services disappear and people get

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,970
upset so we try to take any services

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,450
which are kind of half official and we

00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:01,120
would rather move them into onto Debian

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,850
org hardware and we're so if you have a

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,679
service which is kind of a half official

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,929
thing and you want to make it more

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,080
official and actually have somebody do

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,700
that do the base OS maintenance for you

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,340
so you don't have to worry about that

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,399
then please come and talk to us we're

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:21,210
quite happy to provide you with

00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:21,210
reasonable yams

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:31,000
yeah how to contact us there is that

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,790
well there Deb several mailing lists

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,980
there is a Debian admin at listed in the

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:39,220
dark mailings list where we discussed I

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:42,130
think last year that this mailing list

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,100
will more or less be opened to every

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,140
Debian developer so Debian developer

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:52,240
send can subscribe to that mailing list

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:55,720
as well there's D is a dub DSA at Debian

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,890
dot orc email address which we changed

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,800
to the due to the fact that there was a

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:05,020
Debian admin at Debbie underdog email

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,720
address and there was quite a lot of

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,910
confusion about the Debian admin at

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,220
lists and the Debian admin at Debian dot

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,460
org email address so we decided to move

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:20,500
to a new email alias which is DSA a

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:23,980
Debian dark yeah we hang around on on

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:27,490
IRC as mentioned earlier in the pound

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,870
debian admin IRC channel so feel free to

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:35,340
join there if you have any issues just

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,340
raise them and talk to us

00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:46,929
yeah we I mean like any any people and

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,479
any teams in Debian we obviously have

00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:52,059
more things to do than we actually have

00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:56,379
time for so health it's very much

00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:58,629
appreciated there is getting help with

00:21:56,379 --> 00:22:00,129
sysadmin tasks is it's kind of an

00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:02,349
interesting challenge because you can't

00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:04,389
just gave out routes Joel Debian owed

00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:06,609
machines to somebody who shows up and

00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:10,509
goes I would like to rewrite your

00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:13,629
authentication infrastructure but

00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:16,239
however since we keep the popular

00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:19,479
posture and so on and get there's it's

00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:22,690
at least possible for people to get get

00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:25,210
in and contribute send us patches show

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,549
up discuss things if you think that

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,409
something can be improved it that's

00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:33,609
quite likely and we would be happy to

00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:35,710
discuss how to do that documentation is

00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:38,259
always welcome there is a bit of

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,229
documentation for things like debate

00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:44,979
I've been Olga and so on but more is

00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:47,519
always what welcome also just hanging

00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:51,849
out on IRC altering people's question

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:54,609
it's often very useful yeah we also

00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:56,589
really want to like to grow the team

00:22:54,609 --> 00:23:00,669
from the seven persons team that

00:22:56,589 --> 00:23:03,129
currently we have I think recently or a

00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:06,899
few months ago spoken to a Debian

00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:12,369
developer who is he here in the room

00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:15,729
might be who well said he will he

00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:17,799
currently does not want to become member

00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:20,289
of the DSA team due to the fact that he

00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:26,469
has too much other things other duties

00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:30,399
in Debian so just talk to us and help us

00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:33,279
and then at one point we probably try or

00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:36,339
probably get annoyed with give doing too

00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:39,129
much tasks for you sorry just give give

00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:41,080
order root access and it has usually

00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:42,909
works in Devon right at some point you

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,440
you have contributed enough that it's

00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:46,330
annoying too much it's more annoying to

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,739
merge your patches and review them and

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,520
just give you access so that happens

00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:54,670
well

00:23:51,520 --> 00:24:09,520
I think that's all about the slides and

00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:13,540
well just ask questions I guess this is

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:19,630
more TSA but the the list masterpieces

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:22,690
are those in puppet as well no this

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,490
stuff is not in puppet what the exome

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,770
config we are using on damian darhk--

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:34,150
machines isn't a part but this uses

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:36,850
postfix I don't know if you Alex virtues

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,940
also sitting in the in the lecture room

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:43,870
who could easily answer here questions

00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:50,160
for this Debian a talk as well more

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:50,160
questions no more questions

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:07,699
so as to that so as one of the local

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,489
admins for a bunch of build these I know

00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:12,769
that every now and again we keep own we

00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:14,929
get asked for more stuff opening up more

00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:18,789
ports because we're one of those evil

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:21,739
places with a firewall even for the DMZ

00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:24,139
do you actually have a central list of

00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:27,379
all of the things that you that you want

00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:29,690
to be able to get access to you know

00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:32,029
that kind of thing would be awesome

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,669
that I could just point say the you know

00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:36,709
the arm on network says that it's s

00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:38,599
admins out instead of every now and

00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:40,519
again having to say oh and we need this

00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:41,690
extra thing and then backwards and

00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:45,169
forwards because their immediate

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:48,259
responses well why you know if we can

00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:50,029
give them a list and just say you know

00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:51,849
give them a notification to say that you

00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:56,179
know there's a few new things we'd like

00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:57,799
it might go easier I don't think like I

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:04,479
I don't think we have a list as such

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:07,729
what is we have a firewall config is

00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:10,399
default in I so we have a list of things

00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:12,829
we want to be able to accept on various

00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,529
days so even though we don't have a list

00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:18,169
as they go to this webpage and here you

00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:21,109
have these ports and their justification

00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:22,609
we can we can generate that so yeah

00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:26,149
that's a good idea we should we should

00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:28,429
do something that I could you explain

00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:35,419
more about your backups systemic you

00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:41,899
cover very briefly yes we have Gino

00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:45,049
bacala so bacala is a it's a centralized

00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:47,839
backup system you saying it's kind of a

00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:50,869
mish mix of push and pull and that you

00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:53,149
have a central director which tells the

00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:56,179
machines that are to be backed up that

00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:59,479
you are now going to be packing your

00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:02,299
things up today starch daemon over here

00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:03,919
and then you also it also tells to

00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:08,269
storage even that please expect the

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,789
connection from from this machine we run

00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:12,350
so we run the director which is this

00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:17,330
central component that

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:21,980
runs in ATM in in bite-mark the actual

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:27,400
storage is at DGI and obviously the

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:30,799
various backup machine pick a bar at bar

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,020
one of the painful things about bacala

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,970
is that it thinks that even though we

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,429
were backing up to hard drives it still

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:42,740
thinks we're actually backing up to take

00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:44,809
crimes and that makes for the nice thing

00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,030
about about hard drives is that

00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,980
generally you don't really have seat

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:52,250
time in the same way you have seek time

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:56,120
on on tapes right so you don't care

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,950
about reviving tapes and switching to a

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,169
different tape and so on that's called

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:03,799
opening another file and that's kind of

00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:07,490
it doesn't take very long we also have

00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:11,539
the problem that bacala will it will

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:14,870
it doesn't have a concept so if you look

00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:17,630
at a backup system like backup PC it it

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,850
never does full backups it will only do

00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:24,020
incremental backups and then has a hard

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:25,970
life form back leg will do a full backup

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,000
than incrementals than a full backup

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,010
down incrementals this makes less sense

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,330
when you have hard drives then when you

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:38,210
have tapes and also the scheduler isn't

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:42,890
very smart and if it can't pack up a

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:46,240
machine for some reason then instead of

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,830
rescheduling that that backup it will

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,000
depending on how you configure it it

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:55,159
will then just skip it some of our hosts

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,770
aren't actually don't have that well

00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,630
good connections so when you're then

00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:03,200
trying to do a full backup which can

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,539
take 24 hours you really don't want that

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,950
tcp stream to be disconnected because

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:13,700
then you lost that full backup and and

00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:16,190
also it end up ends up patching the full

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,530
backup so we have they're very clustered

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,470
rather than being nicely spread on so

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:23,150
one of the things we're looking at is

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,880
writing a different gel or for bacala

00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:28,730
just to basically tell it please

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,320
do a full backup of this host now rather

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:39,950
than relying on the under built-in back

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:43,400
shadow so I'm the maintainer of a

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:47,320
package cold but it's a sound a full

00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:50,680
fledge backup system no scheduler etc

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:55,150
but it does it does use for its back-end

00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:59,990
gets packed files rather than tapes so

00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:01,870
if your engine get that may be some

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:04,280
interesting technology to take a look at

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:07,430
last time I looked at Bop it didn't

00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:12,320
actually support expiring backups which

00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:14,480
makes for some pain right you can there

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,760
are some workarounds but yeah there is

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,670
one of the limitations currently yeah

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,570
and for us that would mean we'd run into

00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,590
life

00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:26,750
I'm sure Seagate or Western Digital

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:29,510
would be very happy but I'm not sure

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,720
that our treasurer would be as happiest

00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:35,990
so we kind of need we need the ability

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,790
to expire backups just because we don't

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:44,300
have infinite size hard drives and

00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:47,870
packets are actually quite big one of

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,210
the one of the other issues with specula

00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,010
except currently all of the full backups

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:55,520
run at the same time so if you run into

00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:58,130
some sort of benefit limitations which

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,290
is also not it's not an issue but it's

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:04,570
it's annoying that all machines are

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,570
doing the full backups at the same time

00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,670
any else questions

00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:25,420
so it meant touched on earlier as well

00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:32,590
single sign-on what's what the service

00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:34,890
is next for that that's run away from

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,890
the mic

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,250
also I'll answer that and as far as I

00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:57,640
know and then but then many people may

00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:04,320
have different plans singles Anyang is

00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:11,860
called using ducts which I would suggest

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:16,870
against in general having looked deeply

00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:19,060
into it it was probably it's it probably

00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,640
seemed like the light seemed like a good

00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:28,810
idea at the time but internet moved in a

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:31,660
different direction so but ducts is

00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:37,540
still useful because it's an app a sh

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:42,160
thing so one can just put a directory of

00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:44,980
static files and their backs and that

00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,980
can be done reason of quite reasonably

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,670
simply and at that confer I want to

00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:55,210
discuss with the currently available the

00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:57,610
essays about finishing the ducts set up

00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,650
putting the the basic stuff in puppet

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:03,940
and making a guide for deploying new

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:10,300
stuff any developer that deploys Debian

00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:13,810
services can set up ducts reasonably

00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:18,160
easily but the way that I see we should

00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:20,110
go in the future is all off - which is

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,540
what we are using for the conference

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:30,690
think because well that's a bit more

00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:35,380
like a standard that may work now and

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:39,070
which hopefully supports Knockouts which

00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:42,940
tax does not do very well just move it I

00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:47,320
unfortunately I have not studied both -

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:51,460
so I'm not interested well I'm not it

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:54,130
won't be me that does it if any of you

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,470
knows both - and wants to sit down with

00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:59,770
me and explained it to me step by step

00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,960
during that conf then please I would

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,210
like to migrate

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,480
and they've been contributors to

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,180
although if at all possible but I do

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:14,580
want to understand the protocol before I

00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:16,980
touch it so yeah so the direction in a

00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,160
star is I'm conservative be all - we may

00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,650
get stuck with ducks because it's

00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,920
integrates with a Bosch but I'm not

00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:29,040
comfortable with it and there's too many

00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:33,150
happy things to make things work as

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,120
expected so I wish my personal dream

00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:38,250
would be to at some point move to also

00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:43,830
another place tax wait with that just an

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:46,050
oath to provide it other limitations of

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,670
our contacts set up is that it only

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,070
works for the Debian doctor main

00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:54,600
otherwise we would need to give out

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:58,770
Kitty credentials to the while there is

00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,840
some jurisdiction key and Federation key

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,790
so we would need to give out access to

00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,280
them to the Debian dotnet services

00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:08,640
that's one of the other limitations to

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:13,710
the contacts set up so probably who else

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:16,020
- might be the way to go but in the end

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:19,590
it's up to you and to the Debian

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:23,820
developers helping to extend the single

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:28,110
sign-on as new backs services books a

00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,760
set up something booksy set up something

00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:33,930
that uses Doc's but I don't know what it

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:39,450
is it's a new pts implementation but

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:41,400
it's just for I think you just want to

00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:45,300
know if a person is locked in then he

00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,750
can modify some use on the PT on the new

00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,400
pts implementation and so on one one

00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,940
good thing with Doc's at the moment is

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,030
that login is optional and it totally

00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:00,080
supports serving our site as it is and

00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:05,690
if one is logged in single on yonder and

00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,690
more stuff can happen on top but

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:15,760
yeah I think oh I was two of the better

00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:21,369
better sing for the wiki to do does mine

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:23,589
do although I think I looked that up a

00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:29,440
few months ago and I sing at support

00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:33,400
source to Doc's will give you a remote

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:37,599
user variable so in theory it's easy but

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:46,630
if it does or two then it's more future

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:48,400
proofing mapping yeah okay so of course

00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,569
the fun thing with the wiki is well I

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,670
mean now we're going to touch about on

00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:53,530
this we've got a wiki and web buff see

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:57,309
advertising too

00:36:53,530 --> 00:37:00,549
we also currently got like thousands of

00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:02,799
existing user accounts now obviously for

00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:06,400
people who've already got a layoff or

00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:08,079
a Debian LDAP accounts then we will

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,750
encourage people to merge and just move

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,069
over to those but for the many thousands

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,289
of others you haven't we're going to

00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:22,420
have to come up with something I don't

00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:26,200
know what that is yeah I I mean I don't

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,260
have it for that on the spot they're

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,329
kind of it's tempting to say well it can

00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:35,170
just get themselves and I'll lift the

00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:39,160
couch it might be kind of some people

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:40,510
might be upset at that answer there I

00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,339
guess there was also a question about

00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,930
how many of these accounts are actually

00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:49,960
active rather than somebody registered

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:52,510
back in 2005 and haven't used the kind

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,829
sense I'd be happy to have a

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,289
conversation about this tool in that

00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:58,960
comes because for diving contributors I

00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:02,619
required to have an annual count to get

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,450
credited insight because I don't want to

00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:06,609
have a user database in Debian

00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,410
contributors it may be too much of a

00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:10,750
strict requirement it may be that we

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:13,440
just document that if you do anything in

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:17,079
Debian you get an ally of the counter

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,670
let's talk about it in separately yeah

00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,930
in that case I think we need to have a

00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,780
conversation with my order

00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:26,290
and witches and the Hat of various other

00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:31,690
people with it which is our admin

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:33,520
account sorry admin hat yeah as the

00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,110
person who inflicted Ally auth logins on

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,960
everybody for Deb comp this year I have

00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:40,090
I have been getting feedback that the in

00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,520
particularly signup process for a layoff

00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:46,960
is a bit a bit of an obstacle so there's

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,930
a few things there which I think we

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,450
should talk about streamlining I as the

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,340
person who decided that we were for this

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,500
year moving away from Penta and and

00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,020
moving to summit I strongly felt no I

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,330
did not want to have an authentication

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,270
database I didn't want password hashes

00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:05,710
in in Summit and so I said yes we're

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,200
gonna have to figure out how to hook

00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,510
this up to Debian SSO and the

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,130
consequence of that was yes we had the

00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,960
Debian SSO which is only available for

00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,250
Debian developers Ally auth was the

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,310
other day the database that was out

00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,750
there and so I guess my fault I

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,370
apologize for anybody who was stressed

00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,200
about the the rollout of that because I

00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,960
didn't entirely coordinate with all the

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,150
parties ahead of time but I think it's

00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,770
hanging together fairly well but we

00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,240
should talk sometime this week about

00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,640
where we should go forward with that

00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,230
and if Ally oath is the right

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,170
authentication provider but I think it's

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:40,060
important that we we agree that there be

00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,500
an authentication provider for these

00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:46,660
kinds of services whether that lives in

00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:49,090
Ally auth are somewhere else yeah with

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:55,540
with a flat user name space yes which we

00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:57,580
kind of have today well actually so the

00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,130
way the the way Olaf provides them as

00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:03,060
you get a domain name with it so in fact

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:06,130
all Debian developers have two different

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:12,790
yes it's a flat name space and Debian

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:15,450
developers all have to they can use more

00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,450
questions

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,490
you mentioned that all our hosting is

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,930
sponsored by the hosts and we get some

00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,940
hardware donations at least I think we

00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,160
buy some as well don't we

00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,440
yeah but my question isn't really about

00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,369
that it's more about how much support we

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,529
get well there's there's 1.5 well -

00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:47,269
tending to one hardware manufacturers on

00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:48,920
the sponsors there how much support do

00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:50,809
we get from them for doing interesting

00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,390
stuff I'm thinking like first as you

00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:55,519
mentioned we get fairly regular

00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,039
controller failures and some of our

00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:03,789
hardware and all the sponsors we've got

00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:08,569
have got nice hard to set up multipath

00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:11,509
things it seems to be interesting for us

00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:15,259
and for them to set things up like that

00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:18,890
on the Debian infrastructure as that

00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:21,589
kind of thing possible tomorrow yes we

00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:24,829
do have that in in some places like the

00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:27,769
bite-mark set up the UVC is the e set up

00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:30,799
and so on that's a there we have a sand

00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:34,210
we have a a bunch of machines and other

00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:38,119
it's doing SATA or aging population and

00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:42,019
so three nice cozy ice cast as well yeah

00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:45,920
so we we do have a bunch of that the

00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:48,289
problem is if you want to do data

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,200
storage where you have available 25

00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:55,519
terabytes and you want to do that on a

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:58,849
sand that's very not cheap that's really

00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:02,420
quite expensive so that's the reason why

00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:04,279
those machines with special special

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,160
storage requirements in some kit like

00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:12,410
backups and snapshot basically they're

00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:14,420
different and that's also why they these

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:18,230
two machines because they have they have

00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:20,720
life five controllers each so that's why

00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:24,619
they're they're different in that regard

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,869
we do get we do get a bunch of

00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:31,490
sponsorship from hot the hardware

00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:33,849
vendors we usually buy HP gear partly

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:37,349
because we have good experience with it

00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:41,400
it generally road connections and

00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:43,469
yeah we also have yeah historically good

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,999
connections they've been good at about

00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:47,729
giving us hardware in the past they're

00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:50,910
happy to sponsor Debian and that comfort

00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:52,829
both in actual terms of money given to

00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:58,170
us but also in in terms of giving us

00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:59,489
pretty nice prices we haven't I don't

00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,859
think we've actually approached them

00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:04,170
about saying could you please give us

00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:08,160
this enormously expensive piece of

00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:09,839
hardware it's often hard for them to

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,559
give that away because it has to come

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,559
out of somebody's budget and somehow

00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:23,969
they don't have large sans just hidden

00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:32,459
under that their desks more questions

00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:34,709
criticism hi I was just curious about

00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:39,209
your mail of a structured oh it doesn't

00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:43,140
look like use dkim or SPF 4d mark

00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:47,489
records do you have plans for any of

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:52,499
that there's been some explanation with

00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:55,109
the domain keys so Lukla has been

00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:57,749
playing with that there's this

00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:59,699
interesting project some people we

00:43:57,749 --> 00:44:03,719
generally don't provide outgoing SMTP

00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:07,440
for random people because that's the

00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:10,289
only provider yeah yeah obviously you

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,630
get to Debian all accounts you get

00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:14,430
incoming email which we done forward on

00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,979
to somewhere where it hopefully you'll

00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:19,140
actually remember to have that update

00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:23,279
that when etiquette expires rather than

00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:26,369
giving us bouncers that's that's a big

00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:28,650
change which we forgot to mention is

00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:31,229
that we actually are in the process of

00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,309
reworking the entire MIT way way we do

00:44:31,229 --> 00:44:34,979
mail

00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:37,739
we have drastically reduced the number

00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:42,420
of incoming mail servers so most mail

00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:44,910
now goes to a set of two MX's will

00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,339
increase in the future so it will

00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:51,260
increase in future and at MIT we will

00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:55,290
open up one more mail server well we can

00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,570
currently we are two and then if there

00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,940
are special mail routing needed then it

00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:03,060
will be right or to the right the right

00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,770
internal host but most hosts no longer

00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,060
or lessons for incoming mail from the

00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:10,890
internet which is a good thing not only

00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,900
because it means we don't have to run to

00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:18,980
spam as has in everywhere

00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:23,870
you know he did this thing diem

00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,870
yes GP yeah

00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:31,650
weasel Peter wanted to do I want to do

00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:36,060
Dane opportunistic encryption for

00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:38,970
outgoing article emails so we're

00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:41,220
experimenting with a bunch of things for

00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,620
the what I was going to say about the

00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,870
main keys is that because we don't

00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,590
provide that going mail service it means

00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:51,810

00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,640
maintain or I'm part of the maintainer

00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,650
keys maintain 80 of the Yubikey tools

00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,070
and in that end I would very much like

00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:15,270
to use them for some things there is a

00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:17,100
bunch of we need to find out how they

00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,230
should best fit into the infrastructure

00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:22,230
if we're going to do that one thing

00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,750
which has been mentioned is for some

00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:26,550
cases we want to do actually to factor

00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:30,590
currently there is there is no

00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:33,720
two-factor authentication anywhere so

00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:39,930
help help us in setting up source

00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:42,060
infrastructure right so yes there are no

00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:46,020
concrete plans but yes we're very much

00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:48,600
