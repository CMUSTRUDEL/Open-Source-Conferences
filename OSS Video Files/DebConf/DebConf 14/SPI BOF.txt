	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
at DEFCON for every year for at least

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,150
that long I don't remember exactly when

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,130
we started doing this I think we

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,389
actually had one in Edinburgh but I

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,710
don't remember before that in any case

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:17,730
what we would like to do this morning is

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,460
talk just a little bit about what SPI is

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,189
and that includes sort of an indication

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,900
of who the people are that are involved

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,060
in software in the public interest a

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,179
little bit about the history of the

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,210
organization what the list of our

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,710
associated projects are we always try to

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,780
provide a little bit of a snapshot of

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,450
what the organization's financial status

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,579
is and then hopefully that'll only take

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,710
a few minutes and we can spend as much

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,930
of the rest of the time as people would

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,850
like answering questions talking about

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,020
other things that spy could do in the

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,780
future and so forth so software in the

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,329
public interest is a u.s. nonprofit

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,629
corporation organized under the IRS 501

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:05,670
C 3 category our purpose is to provide

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:09,060
infrastructure for free software

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,880
projects this is the current list of

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,650
officers and board members those that

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,840
are night Alex are not present here at

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,240
debconf I'm actually very pleased that

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,939
in our recent Board of Directors

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,000
selection greggers Peterson is our

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,610
newest member of the board and yet

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,290
another person not particularly

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,650
affiliated with the Debian project so

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,689
over time spi is becoming a little more

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,579
broadly representative and that's a good

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,509
thing those of you that are in the room

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,780
that our client board members please

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:44,490
Martin Nichol Meyers here and zobo why

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,300
don't you also introduce yourselves and

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,930
say hi

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,030
[Music]

00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,980
great so when it comes time for

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,390
questions I'll drag them all in and

00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,480
we'll we'll see what we can do from

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,040
there so as I mentioned what software

00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,810
and the public interest is is a

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,060
nonprofit organization that was

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,310
originally founded Wow was originally

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,750
founded to help organizations develop

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,370
and distribute open hardware and

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,860
software the origins of SPI word that it

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,010
was created in order to serve a need

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,830
that the Debian project had but the

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,530
people that founded SPI realized that

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,200
these same needs would be felt by other

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,910
free software and hopefully open

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
hardware projects and so the

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,100
organization was set up from the

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,630
beginning to not just be able to provide

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,060
services to Debian but to be able to

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,340
provide it to a number of organizations

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,140
from the Debian perspective SPI is the

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,750
organization that holds Debian funds in

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,850
the US and other assets like trademarks

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,670
domain names and the copyright to the

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:56,640
Debian logo SPI was incorporated in June

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,830
of 1997 in state of New York as I said

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,980
we have 501c3 status which means that

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,140
financial contributions made by

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,380
individuals or corporations to SPI in

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,519
the United States may be tax-deductible

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,810
and I've already talked about the fact

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,940
that we support a bunch of other

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,920
projects and this is the first of a

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,190
couple of slides showing some of the

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,310
logos of the organizations that we

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,750
provide services to if you don't

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,910
recognize all of them that's okay

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,190
because I have a hard time putting all

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,890
the names and faces together too but

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,320
over the last couple of years we've

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,989
ended up with quite a few associated

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,510
projects in the last year the two new

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,370
ones are chakra and the mana world as

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,280
far as I can remember I think those are

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,750
the only two new ones in the last year

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,750
we are currently in

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,510
0id I thought was before that I don't

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,440
know if we've gotten them on the list

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:59,470
but I thought that was oh yeah here it

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,480
is right I think that was before debconf

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,080
last year but not a hundred percent

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,850
certain there are a couple of really

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,830
well-known high-profile projects that

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,890
we're having conversations with right

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:15,640
now but it's premature for us to to talk

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,859
about that publicly the nature of the

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,880
relationship we have with these projects

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:23,680
is that when they become associated with

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,570
software in the public interest they

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,830
have the opportunity to take advantage

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:33,130
of our mechanisms for managing financial

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,320
contributions for babysitting assets of

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,500
the kind that I talked about earlier and

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,260
we have the opportunity to help connect

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,870
them with competent legal assistants

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:48,760
when they need it for contracts and

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:52,090
other sorts of things but we don't try

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,040
to control the behavior of these

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,120
projects we don't tell them how to

00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,680
organize the project internally which is

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,450
one of the things that differentiates

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,130
offering the public interest from some

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,380
of the other financial and legal

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,500
umbrella organizations that provide

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:12,250
services to free software projects in

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,180
other parts of our community in terms of

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,940
financial status

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,419
our most recent treasurer's report was

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,540
as of June 30th which that's the last

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,400
one I saw when I was looking last night

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,260
the funds that were holding on entrust

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,440
on behalf of other projects were sitting

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,000
just shy of 650,000 it was about just

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,250
shy of eighty one thousand in general

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,690
reserves for a total of about seven

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,510
hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,960
this is the first of three pages showing

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:43,450
the balances of the funds held in trust

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,330
for different organizations I will point

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,090
out that the Devcon fourteen earmark I

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:52,300
suspect has been tweaked a bit since

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,729
then since we are all here and I'm sure

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,889
monies have been spent that

00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:00,389
gathered too so what ends up happening

00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:03,389
is for an event like Deb conf sponsors

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,129
who want to who are based in the United

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,219
States and want to sponsor that event

00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:10,050
will channel their funds to SPI and then

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:12,449
we help to get them to where they need

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,779
to go to meet the actual needs of the

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:19,169
event but as you can see there quite a

00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:23,279
few projects and there's the second page

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:27,330
worth and you know at this point Debian

00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:29,129
is still one of if not the largest from

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,779
at least more financial asset standpoint

00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,659
organizations that we're providing

00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,889
assistance to but there are a number of

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,699
others that have gotten to be fairly

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:40,649
significant as well and then there's the

00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,089
mostly defunct to OSU next project that

00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:47,789
we still have two dollars and ninety two

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:51,719
cents from okay so anyone who agrees

00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:54,479
with the principles of SPI is encouraged

00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:55,379
to join the organization apply and

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,899
become a member

00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,729
those who participate actively in the

00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,550
free software community and by the way

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:04,800
if you're here at Def Con no question

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,289
you qualify as participating actively in

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,060
the community may apply for contributing

00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,979
membership and the only real distinction

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,800
is that contributing members get to vote

00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:16,439
and get to help select the board of

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,139
directors and that's the Earl you can go

00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,110
if that's is the about SPI still the

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,919
right place or I'm not sure that URL is

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:29,039
actually right but again checking things

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,169
in the middle of the night in terms of

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,509
getting involved we have a monthly Board

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,669
of Directors meeting that's held on IRC

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:37,229
on the hash SPI channel on the Oh FTC

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,080
network

00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:42,209
there's several mailing lists there's

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,550
one that is only accessible to

00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,159
contributing members and one that's wide

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,749
open but joining those lists is a good

00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:52,169
way to see what's going on they are

00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:55,740
relatively low traffic I've said several

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:58,390
some times in the past that you know

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,520
that we're doing well and the organ

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,990
working the way it's supposed to when

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,320
you sort of don't notice that we're

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,530
there and over the last couple of years

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,140
there have been times when we've been

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,180
sort of embarrassed by associated

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,640
projects that had needs that caused us

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,320
to have to scramble around and and and

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,260
get information and data together and

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,810
that reminds us that we can always use

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,220
more assistance if people have time and

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,560
are interested in helping with our

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,630
various processes those are things that

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,850
we would very much be willing and able

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,310
to take advantage of and then there is

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,320
as I said there are several members of

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,640
the board and officers that are here at

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,340
DEFCON for more happy to answer

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,800
questions so with that I don't have

00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,320
anything else presentation-wise to throw

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:52,090
up I'd love to open the floor now to

00:08:44,320 --> 00:09:00,460
questions comments suggestions oh come

00:08:52,090 --> 00:09:03,250
on I realize it's early but what

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,470
differentiates SPI from other fiscal

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,630
sponsorship organizations and how much

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:12,460
you guide prospective projects to one or

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:14,520
another so there are so the other

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,200
project that I think we probably

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,260
coordinate with or communicate with the

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,750
most is the software freedom Conservancy

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,470
and the Conservancy takes a slightly

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,090
more active role in the projects in that

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,570
they have certain expectations about how

00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:34,980
a project is going to govern itself a

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:38,290
lot of the projects that they provide

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,120
services for are actually paying

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,820
developers to do work one way or another

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,250
and so particularly within the context

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,680
of the 501 C 3 regulations there's just

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,650
a set of constraints about how money has

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,980
to flow to prevent this from being

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:56,260
abused in various ways and they are

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,010
frankly better set up to handle that and

00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:03,370
to take that more active role in the

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,830
relationship with the project so between

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,810
those two organizations we point to each

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,120
other all the time

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,730
you know we often tell an organization

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,460
that's coming and asking SPI about the

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,940
possibility of association that we think

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,740
they should go talk to the folks at the

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,500
free software freedom Conservancy too

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,300
before they make a decision because it

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,450
kind of depends on the nature of the

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:30,000
project and what their needs are as to

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,650
which one of those models is more

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,570
appropriate there are a number of other

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,020
umbrella organizations the Apache

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,120
foundation sort of pops to mind where

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,370
you know the rules of organization are

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,740
yet different in that case they sort of

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,690
have a pattern that they expect a

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,520
project they're incubating that's going

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,770
to become part of their ecosystem to

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,680
follow and they don't really provide

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:55,050
services to anybody whose project

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,640
doesn't fit well within their existing

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:01,620
sort of software hierarchy you know

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,650
there are other foundations like that

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,140
but I think quite frankly within the

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,300
sort of context of the kinds of services

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,920
SPI provides the sort of interesting

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,700
alternative to some projects is the

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,700
Conservancy

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,200
so from the just from from the

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,700
experience you've had if I'm an

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,360
individual software free software

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,770
developer and I say start a project and

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,240
it's just me and then I later I've got

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,640
50 contributors and it's growing to the

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,350
point is there are the particular

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,590
threshold events or things I should be

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,090
looking out for in terms of oh I should

00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,130
get become affiliated with some umbrella

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,590
organization or at what point do you

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,360
recommend I be looking at doing

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,430
something like that so one of the real

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,040
triggers is what's the first time that

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,980
you solicit or accept a financial

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,200
contribution because if someone just

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,630
sort of hands you some money then

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,370
there's two things that happen one is

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,570
there's the question of what are the tax

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:08,690
implications of that gift / donation and

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,370
then the second really is what's going

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,810
to happen from a governance snap line I

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,130
mean okay if you if you've decided

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,260
you're gonna have a little meet up

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,060
somewhere and you need you know 250

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,550
dollars to reserve a room at a hotel

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,110
somewhere to have the meeting that may

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,310
be a one-shot event the money comes in

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,820
the money goes out and there's no

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,620
significant consequence but if somebody

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,630
says oh can I sponsor that event to the

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,840
tune of a thousand bucks and now you

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,580
spent two fifteen you've got 750 left

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,170
whose account does that go in and how

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,140
does it get looked after and how do you

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,520
know the person that provided that

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,810
donation is gonna feel good in the end

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,750
about what happened with that money

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,180
those are that's probably to me one of

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,830
the strongest potential trigger points

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,600
for deciding that it's time to sort of

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,370
get your act together and get associated

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,270
with some kind of an umbrella

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,040
organization

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:59,690
I think the key message is I don't think

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,330
fledgling free software projects should

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,910
ever start by thinking about creating

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,860
their own nonprofit entity this has

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,710
happened various times in the past with

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,810
projects large and small thanks to

00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,850
various shenanigans of different kinds

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,300
in both directions in the u.s. the IRS

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,920
now looks very very carefully at

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,019
nonprofit organization founding

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,079
processes particularly for

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:28,739
things that you know matter to us and as

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:31,199
a consequence I think that both because

00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:34,529
it can take a long time be expensive to

00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:36,179
get a separate nonprofit set up and

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,100
because of the fact that most people

00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:39,959
starting free software projects would

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,299
really like to focus on the software and

00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,459
not think about all of those things that

00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:46,110
picking one of the set of currently

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,939
existing financial umbrella

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,610
organizations to associate with would be

00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:53,459
the right answer now from SPI standpoint

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,259
if you're a developer and you've started

00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,549
a project and you think it's going to be

00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:59,809
the greatest thing since sliced bread

00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:03,299
it's not yet time to come talk to us

00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:05,489
because one of the sort of criteria that

00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:08,369
we apply is is this a substantial and

00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:09,540
significant free software project what

00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:11,670
does that mean well we have some

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,699
projects that only have a half dozen or

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,799
so participants so it's not really about

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:18,689
headcount it's sort of something we have

00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,179
to decide on a case-by-case basis it

00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:22,589
might have to do with the volume of

00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:24,720
money that's flowing through in

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,189
donations it might have to do with how

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,769
many people are involved it might have

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:30,299
to do with how many non-financial assets

00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:33,449
are out there that somebody ought to

00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:37,069
help babysit so there's no sort of hard

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:40,199
and fast criteria really for that but I

00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,639
think anytime you get to the point where

00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,049
you're crossing a threshold and the

00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,179
number of people involved in the

00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,639
organization where you're starting to

00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:51,089
think about how are we going to sort of

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,040
make sure that as we go forward assets

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,569
that matter to us are being well taken

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,179
care of and that somebody doesn't run

00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:59,160
away with them those are also times when

00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,470
it's good to to start thinking about

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,740
it's generally do it sooner rather than

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,990
later but not when you're one person

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,169
with a key pala code you just put up on

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,169
github

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,980
other questions

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,980
[Music]

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,329
[Music]

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:24,060
you mentioned free software and you also

00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:27,750
mentioned open hardware it's interesting

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:31,019
that we're in a point in our movement

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,360
where the open source initiative has

00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:37,889
deliberately said they do not want to

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,230
tackle open hardware licensing and so

00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,819
what that's meant is we've had tapper

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,579
open hardware license and we've had

00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:47,040
other various open hardware licenses

00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:51,329
come along right and so my question to

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,709
you is based on your experience what is

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,269
that what does the future look like

00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:56,279
especially now with the so-called

00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:58,430
Internet of Things coming on and and

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:01,769
hardware hacking becoming very popular

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:06,300
what does freedom look like for hardware

00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:09,750
projects and how can SBI help that's a

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:14,279
really good question so when SPI was

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:17,730
started the founding documents talked

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:20,970
about open hardware an open software the

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,680
only activity that I can recall that SPI

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,290
has been directly involved in around

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:29,180
Hardware was an early attempt that bruce

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:33,029
perens was spearheading to create a

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,459
hardware branding program and this was

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:38,130
it was way too early to really have a

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:39,750
chance of working but it was in some

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,689
ways analogous to what the Free Software

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,519
Foundation is now doing with their

00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:46,589
respects your freedom branding program

00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,130
and it never really got off the ground

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:53,180
and frankly since then our attention has

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,319
been almost entirely consumed by

00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:00,660
services being provided to our

00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:02,850
associated free software projects so to

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,309
some extent I don't think SPI is an

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,809
organization has a great answer to your

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,309
question and certainly doesn't have

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:14,189
well-formed organizational opinions

00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:16,409
personally as you're aware and happy to

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:18,780
tell other folks in the room the open

00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:20,689
hardware products that Keith and I and

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,509
others are involved with on

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:25,509
the Altos Metron banner are all licensed

00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:28,359
under the tap or open hardware license I

00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,799
happen to think that license is

00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:34,700
interesting in that it's trying very

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,999
hard to provide GPL like behaviors

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,889
around hardware designs and I like that

00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:42,499
a whole lot better than gee I slapped a

00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:46,340
creative commons attribution share-alike

00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:49,700
on it and walked away but we have to the

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,859
best of my knowledge zero examples of

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,229
any legal precedent being formed around

00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,779
any of the open hardware licenses there

00:17:54,229 --> 00:18:00,950
people are using right now so all of

00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:02,830
that is little speculative having said

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,169
all of that if an open hardware project

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,789
came to SPI and said we'd like to

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,919
associate with SPI

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,470
I think we'd apply the same criteria

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,570
that we do to you know free software

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:18,379
projects we asked what is it they want

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:21,679
need are there's of transaction flows

00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:23,059
compatible with our processes are you

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,749
know does this feel like something else

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:28,700
we could just say yes to or is are there

00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:29,539
set of needs so different that it just

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,029
doesn't make sense

00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,919
I mean SPI certainly doesn't want to get

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,269
involved in sort of hardware production

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,669
distribution any of those sorts of

00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:40,820
things that's hard and different and

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:43,519
really not appropriate for a 501 C 3 but

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,309
I could see holding project trademarks

00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,320
and domain names maybe managing some you

00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,940
know donation flow for a conference

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,609
associated with a free Hardware

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,279
community or something as being the

00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,720
kinds of things that could make sense

00:18:54,279 --> 00:19:00,519
whether we'll ever have a project come

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,519
to us and ask for that I don't know

00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:07,210
other questions yeah over

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:17,990
so it's regarding machine donation I

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:21,380
would like to donate a machine here in

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,440
u.s. this machine is going to be a power

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:28,400
machine for IBM and the way that IBM

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:32,270
works is they prefer much better to do a

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,590
long term long other than a donation so

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:38,600
is it okay for you and the second

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,450
question is regarding and we have a

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,740
machine other machine in Brazil and we

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,320
are going to have a third machine in

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,780
Brazil as well there are to be some

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,460
building on that beam is there anything

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,840
that we need to do with this machine

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,810
because they are going to be fully

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,240
located for Debian so is there any kind

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,490
of contract that we should do in order

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,830
if we are going to proceed to having

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,470
those machines as because we're students

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,030
customers DSA if we are going to have

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:09,430
those machines or if we are going to

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:12,200
have only you owe us so what is your

00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:15,530
suggestion on this case well the first

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,690
order spi would largely be involved in

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,640
things that are going to be done in at

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,640
the end or hosted in the u.s. I don't

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,460
know that SPI itself has any particular

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,680
value to add or reason to want to be

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,330
engaged in hardware that's being made

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,700
available for Debian in a place like

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,440
Brazil that would actually probably be a

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,770
better question for the Debian project

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,290
leader and or whoever's managing assets

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:45,020
on behalf of the Debian project at this

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:47,960
point in terms of managing something as

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,490
a loan instead of an outright donation I

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,860
see no reason that that should pose a

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,810
particular problem someone somewhere

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,240
just needs to sort of keep documentation

00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,010
about the status of that and where it

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,320
came from and who it needs to go back to

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:03,740
if and when and that certainly seems

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,500
like something SPI advantage so I know

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,450
we have the past and present secretaries

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,660
both in the room if they'd like to speak

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,660
up

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,580
so I certainly remember seeing something

00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,880
about this query come up and I think

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,980
that the response at that time was what

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,630
was the benefit that SPI was adding in

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,640
that kids because it wasn't a noun sent

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,230
that Debian would own there was going to

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,929
be in IBM's us that there was a query

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,790
about whether SPI needed to enter into

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:34,500
this learning contract or whether IBM

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,990
could just give access to the machine to

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,630
DSA without needing the overhead of SPI

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,190
being involved I agree with BDO I don't

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,450
see a problem with that it was just

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,340
wasn't clear at the time when someone

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,919
was asking whether or not it was even

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,410
necessary oh yeah excellent point I

00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,140
don't see any value that's really being

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,510
added by SPI being involved in that kind

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,340
of a transaction as long as the asset

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,340
continues to be owned by somebody other

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,290
than our Associated project we don't

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,540
need to be involved if you'd like us to

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:06,150
be involved to help manage that I guess

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,770
we could be it does tie into one of the

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,960
things that SPI offers in that we are at

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,330
least a legal entity that can sign

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,250
contracts such as that if a donor

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,500
requires that that is yes you can take

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,390
we've had a number of cases in the past

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,309
where one of our associated projects

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,190
wanted to enter into an agreement of

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:24,990
some kind or other and needed a legal

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,660
sum of someone legally authorized to

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,669
sign on their behalf and I and various

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,380
others on the SPI board have been called

00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:32,970
upon at various times to assign things

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,590
and fax them back that's not a big

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,900
problem I will admit that in the context

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,669
actually of Def Con 14 there was a

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,130
request for a signature on a contract

00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:46,740
that I pushed back and said no sorry I

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,620
can't sign that and it had to do with

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,640
the terms that a particular potential

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,470
sponsor wanted to place on their

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,260
sponsorship money and it just was not

00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,870
compatible with a free software project

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,910
and they meant no harm by it it was just

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,340
their standard corporate agreement thing

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,460
they just were surprised that I actually

00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,010
read it and said no

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:16,280
[Music]

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:23,470
but you know sorry it happens other

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,470
questions back here

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:33,290
like I'm just curious if that SBI has

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,530
investments than any kind of so if

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:41,150
there's an investment policy not as well

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:43,160
organized as you'd like the funds that

00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,660
we have are broken into several

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,610
different accounts and they're in

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,050
different places with sort of different

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:53,270
terms associated with them we until the

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,520
last year or so haven't really been

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,370
managing an asset balance that made

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,040
doing something more than parking it in

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,630
you know modestly interest bearing you

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,170
know business oriented account would

00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:08,660
have made sense for and frankly our

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:12,650
advice to our associated projects is to

00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:14,870
not accumulate financial assets we would

00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,090
really prefer that our associated

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,650
projects use the donation stream that's

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,320
coming in and if they need more later

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:25,010
ask for it than to be keeping big

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,740
reserves sitting around having said all

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,970
of that I think as we you know hit you

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,760
know we're now sort of in the

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,080
three-quarters of a million range it

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,390
certainly makes sense for us to be

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,740
considering that and it's something that

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,320
a couple of us have had conversations

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,960
about that we've taken no specific

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,850
action yet there's sort of this

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,100
balancing thing because most of those

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,020
funds aren't really SP eyes they're

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,820
being held in trust for the various

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,090
associated projects and so while there's

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:55,490
a big central balance if you know

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,020
PostgreSQL comes to us and says time for

00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,820
us to run another event drain our

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,490
account we need to go spend all that

00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,980
money the answer would be okay here it

00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:07,180
is and so we have to be careful about

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,680
long term investment vehicles because

00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,270
while we have a more substantial balance

00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,310
now if you saw it it's spread over a lot

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:17,750
of small sort of trust accounts and you

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,670
know trying to do things that have fixed

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,410
duration even like certificates of

00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,540
deposit gets a little concerning because

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,000
we need to maintain the ability to

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:31,000
respond with appropriate liquidity to

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
those project requests yeah

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,770
so what are you doing after you have a

00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,570
an entity that's enrolled in your

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,340
program and they've been with you for a

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,070
couple years and probably never come up

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,870
they ask you to drain their funds you

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,220
provide their trust funds back to them

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,380
and then they're spending the money in

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,260
ways that are not consistent with your

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,400
original program so we've never actually

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:58,640
had an incident yet where an Associated

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,590
project consciously set out to do

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,580
something that was in violation of the

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:07,370
501c3 legal boundary we have had a

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,890
couple of cases where a project started

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,750
with an association with SP I grew to a

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,460
certain point and decided it was time to

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,560
do something different

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,900
one interesting example of that is the

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,390
genome Foundation early in the genome

00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,340
project they were an SPI associated

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:26,360
project and when the genome Foundation

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:29,900
got started obviously you know they

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,210
moved to that context it depends on the

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,790
nature of that transition as to whether

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,160
we have the ability to transfer their

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,170
existing asset balance or not so for

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,100
example if someone wants to move from

00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:44,900
one 501c3 to another 501 C 3 it's not

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,670
very hard for us to arrange for their

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,820
assets to follow them across that

00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,650
transactional boundary if they all of a

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,110
sudden decide wow we're done with this

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:57,530
we want to incorporate and run this some

00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:00,440
other way then we can't just transfer

00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:03,350
their balance out of a 501 C 3 to some

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,520
sort of a commercial context this has

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:09,010
led actually in the last three months

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,750
we've had a couple of interesting

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:15,350
conversations about okay is it time for

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:18,050
us to review and improve our life cycle

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,660
documentation around what happens when a

00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,370
project vaporizes I mean I sort of

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,030
jokingly referred to the project that

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,130
has less than $3 asset left with us that

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,470
project started off with a certain

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,260
amount of impetus they had a couple of

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,450
objectives that were not met all of the

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,100
folks involved realized as a consequence

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,240
of that

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,039
it was never gonna go the way they

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,950
wanted to and the whole project kind of

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,020
vaporized and fortunately we weren't

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,730
left holding six figures worth of assets

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,880
it was you know one figure worth of

00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,880
assets

00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:53,350
Minoo and i think in sort of in the

00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,120
absolute limit

00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,549
that'll fall into our general reserves

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,200
and you know we'll do something

00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:02,380
appropriate with it someday maybe if we

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,970
have to I guess but this does raise the

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,549
question of you know what are the

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,070
criteria under which we are willing and

00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:11,320
able to declare a project defunct we've

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,510
never really done that before we had a

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,400
couple projects where they seemed to go

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,110
inactive they didn't have any assets we

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,460
poked them and they said yeah sorry we

00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,400
should have told you but we're often

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,140
other things now and we just quietly you

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,960
know passed a resolution to take them

00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,909
off the list and that was easy but when

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,820
that happens and they're still assets

00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:32,830
being held it's not so easy so I think

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,190
one of the action items we have this

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,590
year is to try and review those elements

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,650
of our sort of existing process

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:45,539
lifecycle documentation and and work on

00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:47,950
them some in all honesty you know I

00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,200
consciously did something that violated

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,510
our 501c3 status we'd have our legal

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,850
counsel involved quickly and we would

00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,580
take whatever the actions were they were

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,140
deemed appropriate because protecting

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,270
the ability of the rest of our

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,820
associated projects to retain their

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,770
current legal and financial status is

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,270
far more important to us than you know

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,590
looking the other way when somebody does

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,590
something Pro inappropriate

00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,170
yeah as a spy affiliate project the

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,780
experience I've had is that the spy

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,970
funds management is not as hands-off as

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,120
as it would appear from this

00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,650
conversation every every expenditure

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,880
from one of the spy affiliates is

00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,920
actually managed directly by this

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,710
treasurer of spy and the funds are

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,690
transferred from spy to the target

00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,130
whatever that whatever the project is so

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,170
if I want to go buy a bunch of computing

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,020
hardware the funds are transferred from

00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,580
spy to me and then from me to the to the

00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,780
hardware vendor that spun funds are

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,960
transferred directly to the hardware

00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,880
vendor so the availability of funds in

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,010
inappropriate usage of funds is pretty

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,080
minimal because you would have to you

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,310
would have to confuse the spy treasure

00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,430
into thinking that some inappropriate

00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:59,860
expenditure was conforming to the rules

00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,780
so there are actually very fairly strong

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,880
guarantees that it can't happen today

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,480
I appreciate you bringing that up Keith

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:11,940
because perhaps not so obviously I don't

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,940
actually ever use any of spies money so

00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,100
yeah any other questions

00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:23,419
okay well if there are no other

00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,669
questions I will thank you very much for

00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,499
your time in attendance I hope that if

00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:30,499
nothing else any of you in the room are

00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:33,469
not currently SPI members or have not

00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:35,389
currently requested conversion to the

00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:38,450
status of contributing member we'll go

00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:41,690
back and do that because we would very

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:46,309
much like to have your attention and

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:48,499
involvement in our processes and you

00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:51,919
know some of the questions that were

00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:54,200
asked if there are particular areas of

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,019
expertise or insight that you would like

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,029
to contribute to the organization please

00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:02,089
let us know we're always very

00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:04,159
appreciative of additional help with all

00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:06,169
of the things we try to do on behalf of

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,479
what as you saw is a really

00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:10,749
interestingly diverse list of

00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:13,960
significant free software projects

00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:13,960
thanks again
