[Applause]

00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:12,599
well first of all I just want to thank

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,280
the organizers for doing this great job

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,580
I've done it once and it's really hard

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,180
work and it's been a little bit since

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,240
I've been at DEP comp and it's really so

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,949
so nice to be back here for those that

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,800
don't know who I am

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,070
Gabriella people call me Ella and I've

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,440
spent about the last 10 years looking at

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,000
different hacker communities and my

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,629
first project was on free and open

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,660
source software with a big focus on

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:44,850
Debian and it kind of culminated in a

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,510
book called coding freedom the ethics

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,070
and aesthetics of hacking which is

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,190
available under a Creative Commons

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,980
license if you haven't checked it out I

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,469
was a pretty kind of regular at Deb

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,180
Kampf but for the last number of years I

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,489
got lost in a wormhole and it was a bit

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,400
of a fun wormhole it was a bit of a

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,880
scary wormhole and I feel like I've

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,979
actually only gotten out of the wormhole

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,799
literally about ten days ago and that's

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:22,259
because I finished this book completely

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,500
in about August 10th and the wormhole

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,939
was looking at anonymous and studying

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,250
anonymous and it really took a huge

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,650
amount of my time and effort and

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,909
emotions and compared to something like

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,840
Debian was a much much tougher puzzle to

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,479
crack and the talk I'm giving today is

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,340
primarily about anonymous and you may be

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,520
wondering what does anonymous have to do

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,290
with Debian or free software and at one

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,360
level it kind of has nothing to do with

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,509
these but at another level it actually

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,790
does have a lot to do with free software

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,820
and hacker politics and also the

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,799
questions of access and openness and I

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,829
wasn't really planning on giving a talk

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,599
in part because I was exhausted while I

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,480
was traveling through this wormhole for

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,270
three years but some folks suggested

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,720
that

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,660
I went to this other galaxy and I've

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,520
emerged back that I should give a talk

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,500
about it and what I'm going to do today

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,460
is focus quite a bit on anonymous but

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm going to try to make some

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:34,360
connections between them and open source

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,250
and also contextualize anonymous within

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,320
this word of flourishing of hacker

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:44,670
politics that we've seen in the last

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:47,860
couple of years my talk has a warning

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,260
we're entering a politically incorrect a

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,209
zone all personnel entering the premises

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,780
will encounter a thing called freedom of

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:59,160
speech and in fact Anonymous is quite

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,230
known for their offensive speech and I

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,550
will admit that Anonymous will be of

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:08,410
violating the code of conduct because of

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,970
their offensive speech I think that they

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,760
would be very happy to hear that they

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,980
violating the code of conduct if you are

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,220
concerned with adult language or

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,260
expletives and this is a problem you

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,550
might mean you know want to leave I

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,150
don't actually think it's going to be

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,280
too much of a problem but I think it's

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,870
important to mention it mention it at

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,360
the start of the talk so the talk is

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,989
divided into three parts how is it that

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,630
Anonymous turned to activism it's a very

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,970
interesting story a second part which is

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,940
about their sociology their politics

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,620
their political significance and then

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,530
finally I'm going to get to weapons of

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,650
the geek and talk about the broader

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,840
milieu but to start we're going to start

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,700
with a question of an accident in the

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,280
accident because I really do think that

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,380
Anonymous is a tale about a crazy

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,690
aberration perhaps one of the weirdest

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,510
political accidents ever to have

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:10,269
occurred now this is not unusual to

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,450
anonymous only even free software at

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:16,959
some level has these accidental elements

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,620
and so for example when Richard Stallman

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,460
dreamed up the idea of free software and

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:26,230
eventually architected a legal element

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,030
to free software he didn't invent

00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,710
in free software to be a kind of global

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,560
collaborative project and it was Linda's

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,410
Torvalds who accidentally initiated that

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,670
right so these are pretty common things

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:42,670
in the history of politics but as we'll

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,280
see in a moment I think the accident was

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:49,420
really on overdrive with anonymous a

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,470
good place to start is in 2007 fox news

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:55,740
featured anonymous one evening and a

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,530
general new segment and they called

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:03,130
Anonymous hackers on steroids

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,140
a bit hyperbolic and then they also call

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,440
them the internet hate machine as well

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:11,680
which was a term that anonymous kind of

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,220
embraced somewhat ironically but not

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,600
entirely ironically either the question

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:22,450
is was Fox News being just colorful were

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,790
they exaggerating as Fox News often does

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:30,280
right well yes and no Fox News was

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:35,080
reporting on anonymous because at the

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,410
time in 2007 anonymous was purely a kind

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,850
of trolling outfits they were really

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:48,130
well known for causing discord eeeh for

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:50,620
choosing targets to humiliate them and a

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,170
lot of the activity came out of 4chan

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,570
org and if you haven't been there please

00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:59,890
enter at your own risk

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:03,280
and this trolling activity was done for

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:05,640
the lulz for the laughter to take

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,940
pleasure in the suffering of others and

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:14,290
Anonymous was only known for this

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:17,890
activity now as an academic I strive for

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,050
some precision in my definitions and

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,240
actually think that one definition

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,560
provided by anonymous as to what

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,980
trolling is really captures the spirit

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,620
of trolling and that's ultra coordinated

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:37,780
 II so that's what they were

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,850
doing from about 2004 pretty much until

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,430
2000 and

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:47,380
so one example of one of their trolling

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:49,930
raids was done against habbo hotel habbo

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,710
hotel is a social networking site that

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:57,490
is popular in Finland among the youth

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:59,650
apparently and anonymous once engaged in

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,740
a trolling raid where they created a

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,440
bunch of avatars where everyone was um

00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,390
you know african-american with afros and

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,840
suits and they blocked access to the

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,840
pool because the pool had a aids and

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,700
fail and this is classically you know

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,300
extremely offensive

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,590
and what Anonymous did this was in 2006

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,750
now what's interesting actually about

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,900
the habbo hotel raids was there was

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,330
actually a slight political sensibility

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,840
there were rumors that the moderators in

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,900
habbo hotel were blocking avatars if

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,020
there were dark so they were using very

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,200
offensive means to to protest have a

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:46,710
hotel but it was primarily about

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:51,340
trolling so now let's fast forward to

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,250
today literally today last week when

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:58,660
Anonymous is now a name used primarily

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:02,890
to instigate revolution protests around

00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,720
the world and in order for me I'd like

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,400
to actually show you an example related

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,610
to one of their most recent operations

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,350
which relates to operation Ferguson in

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,000
Ferguson Missouri and this operation

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,760
concerns a young African American man

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,300
Mike Brown who shot six times by police

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,460
officer an anonymous swooped in and they

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,310
do what they do now which is engage in

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,650
distributed denial-of-service attacks

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,320
and hacking but they're also very well

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,930
known for helping to organize protests

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,270
and create videos to kind of raise

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,910
political awareness and consciousness so

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,100
let me now play about one minute of a

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,700
video that they created for operation

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,700
Ferguson

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,149
you know within 24 hours of Robin

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,980
Williams death we knew more about what

00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,810
happened that we've learned in four days

00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:06,510
of the very public shooting of Mike

00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:10,570
Brown they're threatening to mace you

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:12,730
yeah media do not that so if you're

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,140
getting Nathan I'm you pass up the cure

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,140
gap is pretty pretty thing

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,560
greetings citizens of the United States

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,720
we are anonymous

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,700
in recent light of the situation in

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,800
Ferguson Missouri where the people's

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,810
right to protest has been usurped by an

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,060
illegal curfew and the deployment of the

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,950
National Guard were committed to stand

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,170
hand in hand with the people in Ferguson

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,480
where peaceful protesters have been

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,850
arrested journalists threatened and the

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,130
right to protest criminalized using

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,560
jammers to disrupt communication of live

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,450
streamers letting plum rule the streets

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,390
like dictators in the Middle East to

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,880
hurt people no-fly zone in a word of

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:55,510
military force will not ensure peace and

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,500
justice in Ferguson jay Nixon this is

00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,450
not democracy

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,100
this may be your right but not your

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,690
right to fight us and that's what why

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,450
the dosage of online and offline

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,450
protests will continue so that's pretty

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,060
remarkable I think to go from these you

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,730
know extremely offensive trolls that are

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,240
all about pranking to this which is

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:20,140
about protests and political awareness

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,850
and this is just one example of over 200

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,829
operations that Anonymous has been

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,990
involved in the last number of years so

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:28,060
for example they were involved in the

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,800
Arab Spring they were one of the first

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,940
kind of outside groups to report on

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,790
Tunisia in January 2011 shuttling and go

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,940
furring videos out of the country to the

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,060
Western media they were an informal

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,640
protest

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,630
or I mean public relations wing for the

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:50,060
Occupy movements and Anonymous is quite

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,880
well-known to be triggered into action

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:56,510
when it comes to any sort of intranet II

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,730
issue or censorship issue so for example

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:04,700
they were quite involved in stopping

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:07,730
SOPA which is about piracy and engage

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,390
quite extensively so the question is how

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:13,910
do these trolls pivot towards activism

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,890
right and one of the fascinating things

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,040
is that it really has a lot to do with

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:22,550
Tom Cruise we have Tom Cruise to thank

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,790
for anonymous and what happened and

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,830
really because he believes in xeno that

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,780
is really part of it because really what

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,780
happened was that there was this video

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:38,730
was has brought to this world there

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:42,949
still remains one more word on the man

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,070
Kollek Tom Cruise on Tom Cruise

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:49,079
Scientologist

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:50,490
I think it's privileged to call yourself

00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,430
a Scientologist as something that you

00:11:50,490 --> 00:12:00,930
have earned and because Scientologist

00:11:53,430 --> 00:12:02,490
does where she has the ability to create

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,060
new and better realities and improve

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,800
conditions being Scientologists you look

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,639
at someone and you know absolutely that

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:14,250
you can help them okay so that video was

00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,170
leaked by little a anonymous it was

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,820
members of the Church of Scientology who

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,709
were critical of the church who got the

00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,139
video out of this church was meant only

00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,899
for internal consumption for Scientology

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,470
members it's spread like wildfire and

00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,600
news establishments like Gawker

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,820
published the video and Scientology is

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,029
known for its very litigious nature and

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,070
so they got out there they got out their

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,820
lawyers and the lawyers threatened

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:44,670
websites like Gawker with lawsuits and

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,399
once they did that anonymous the

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,339
trolling outfits like hey what a perfect

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,350
target let's troll the heck out of the

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,540
Church of Scientology and to this day

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,230
it's probably their mothership trolling

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:01,079
raid I mean basically they ddosed every

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,540
website related to Scientology they sent

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,990
hundreds of pizzas to Scientology

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:11,160
churches across the country they pranked

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:15,089
the Dianetics hotline they scanned their

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,480
you know butts and then sent faxes of

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:21,360
their butts to churches these sorts of

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,120
things they had a great time doing it

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,720
and as part of this trolling raid they

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,220
created a video and the video was done

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,380
for the sake of the lulz

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,660
and it was a very important video and

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:37,440
now I want to show you leaders of

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,990
Scientology that is over the years we

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,000
have been watching you your campaigns of

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,220
misinformation your suppression of

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,470
dissent your litigious nature all of

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,209
these things have caught right with the

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,730
leakage of your latest propagate

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:52,559
video inter mainstream circulation the

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,209
extent of your malign influence over

00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,970
those who have come to trust you as

00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,199
leaders has been made clear to us

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,059
Anonymous has therefore decided that

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,639
your organization should be destroyed

00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,379
for the good of your followers for the

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,959
good of mankind and for our own

00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,389
enjoyment we shall proceed to expel you

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,800
from the internet and systematically

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:13,290
dismantle the Church of Scientology in

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,350
its present form we recognize you as

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:19,740
serious opponents okay so this video

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,019
also took off it was like wildfire and

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,990
the interesting thing is that within

00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,420
Anonymous it helps spur a debate and the

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,059
debate was shall we stay faithful to our

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,579
madcap roots and continue to be these

00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:35,160
you know gnarly internet trolls or

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,569
should we actually earnestly protest the

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,449
Church of Scientology I mean this is

00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:41,550
truly a debate that started to happen

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:43,889
after this video and after some critics

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,420
of the church also said hey you guys are

00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,689
kind of powerful why don't you jump

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:51,179
aboard the ship of kind of protest and

00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:53,490
activism well they made a decision and

00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:56,600
the decision came in the form of a

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,850
global day of protests on February 10th

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:04,920
2008 where over 7,000 geeks and nerds

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:09,509
showed up across 127 cities in front of

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,819
Scientology churches and protested and

00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,799
it was really interesting I went to the

00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:15,779
protest in New York City and it was

00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,179
pretty clear that first of all a lot of

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,850
these like internet nerds came from

00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:22,470
4chan and 4chan truly is kind of

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,279
anonymous and they just wanted to meet

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:28,470
other kind of people from 4chan but on

00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,249
the other hand what also happened was

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,569
that the media validation that they got

00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:35,369
as well as just the feeling of

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:38,720
empowerment when you kind of hit the

00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:42,360
streets was enough to constitute a new

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,040
activist project a long term activist

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,399
project and it went by the name of

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,860
Operation chanology and this was the

00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,470
kind of name of the anonymous operation

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,959
that started to earnestly target the

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,019
Church of Scientology and people from

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,160
anonymous every month started to protest

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,889
the church now is

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,440
for a slight detour how is it that I

00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:09,379
kind of got involved right these things

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,990
were happening but why was it that it

00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:14,029
caught my attention well I'm going to

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:19,490
confess I myself have had a relationship

00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:21,410
with Xenu and it happened in 2007 when I

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,800
ended up at the University of Alberta

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,569
for a postdoc and I found out that the

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,180
largest scientology archives in the

00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:31,910
world are housed in this university and

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,579
i was like oh oh this is wonderful

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,860
because during my research with free and

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:39,379
open source software hackers a number of

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,519
people had told me that they were

00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:45,649
involved in protesting the church in the

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:49,009
1990s and that they had released secret

00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:50,750
church documents and that in fact the

00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,839
very issues i was interested in

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,750
copyright and Trademark were actually

00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,259
explored because of the battles that

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:03,319
occurred in what is humorously referred

00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:05,900
to as internet versus Scientology and

00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,390
there was a very popular Usenet group in

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,270
the 1990s that circulated secret church

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,699
documents and Scientology when after its

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,880
critics in a very kind of hardcore

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:20,030
fashion and here I was at the University

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,370
of Alberta and I was studying these

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,130
early battles but it was actually quite

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:28,339
secretive about the project because you

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,620
know Scientology is and was a little bit

00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:35,000
creepy and they went after academics and

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,980
journalists and at the time what I found

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,799
so interesting when I was doing the

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:43,130
project wasn't simply the fact that

00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:45,799
Scientology went after its critics but

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,990
as an anthropologist I was interested in

00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:51,440
the fact that Scientology seemed to be

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:54,380
the perfect nemesis for the geek in

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,020
hacker world it was like Scientology was

00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:01,190
the evil doppelganger of the hacker

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:04,370
world now I'm gonna now offer you one

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:07,490
tiny morsel from Scientology that I

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,539
think will prove very immediately what I

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,130
mean by this hackers have a very

00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:13,760
particular relationship to Science and

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,580
Technology

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,140
and Scientology is a religion about

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,570
science and technology whose

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,850
relationship to technology could not be

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,370
more different than the way that hackers

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,380
treat technology so I'm going to show

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,610
you a document called keeping

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,800
Scientology working which one might say

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,340
condenses again the view that

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,230
Scientology takes on technology so

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,230
keeping Scientology working consists of

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,980
getting the correct technology applied

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,950
consists of having the correct

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,760
technology knowing the technology

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,410
knowing it is correct

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,450
teaching correctly the correct

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,670
technology applying the technology

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,040
seeing that the technology is correctly

00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,080
applied hammering out the existence of

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,330
incorrect technology knocking out

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,980
incorrect applications closing the door

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,830
on any possibility of incorrect

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,260
technology and closing the door on

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,710
incorrect application and this is you

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:13,070
know done with no irony whatsoever right

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:15,830
this this is the truth and so what was

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,170
really fascinating to me was the way

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,720
that you know geeks and hackers in the

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,690
90s had found their perfect nemesis and

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,880
so when anonymous came into being I was

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,550
like oh this is like proves my thesis

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,950
that one Scientology goes after this

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:36,920
population there is this true enjoyment

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:39,500
in in in protesting your nemesis so I

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,200
decided to start following anonymous I

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,870
was also really just intrigued by that

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,850
and that transformation from you know

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,790
these trolls that were living in the

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,940
kind of underbelly the underworld of the

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,590
Internet and that they decided to sail

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,860
on the ship of activism

00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:01,370
so let's now fast forward to 2010

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:06,140
this is April 2010 where the were the

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:08,230
kind of very famous hacker institution

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,800
that was involved in politics was not

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,860
anonymous

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,960
it was WikiLeaks at this time and

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:17,960
WikiLeaks released collateral murder it

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,980
was provided by Chelsea Manning and for

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,100
those that don't know what collateral

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:24,670
murder is it was a US military video

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,990
that in fact the Reuters news

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,880
organization was trying to get access

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,409
- they had requested it through a

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,600
Freedom of Information Act and they

00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:35,419
could not get it and the reason why they

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,610
wanted it was this video shows us

00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:40,039
soldiers gunning down a couple of

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:43,520
journalists and children and it shows

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:46,880
the cold-blooded pathological reality of

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,909
war that tends not to be shown anymore

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,559
in our news organization and it really

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:57,799
caused quite a bit of controversy and it

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,399
was something that really put hackers on

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:04,580
the political map at this time anonymous

00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:08,029
was geopolitically insignificance now

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:10,309
let's now go to the fall of 2010

00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:13,520
September there was something by the

00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:16,070
name of an on ops which is an iron Chua

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,500
Lee became an IRC server and what

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,240
happened was chanology was still

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,520
protesting the Church of Scientology

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,309
there was still some trolling under the

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,700
name of anonymous but a new wing a new

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:30,679
node came into being and what was

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,130
interesting about this new node was

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,559
first of all it wanted to defend

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:40,899
file-sharing and piracy that became its

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:43,190
issue of choice but the more significant

00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:45,169
innovation was that they started to use

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,669
digital direct action in the form of

00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,830
hacking and distributed

00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:49,909
denial-of-service attacks to make their

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,370
political points

00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:55,370
these were tactics that were dropped by

00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:59,659
chanology chanology really stayed within

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:02,029
the legal domain now how they came into

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:04,580
being was also very much like that

00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:07,070
accident I just told you about and I

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,010
don't have time to go into the details

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,590
but I do go into it in my book but very

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,080
soon after the constitution of Anan ups

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,200
they come to intersect with WikiLeaks

00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,039
and it has to do with Cablegate so

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,390
Cablegate is when WikiLeaks releases

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,640
diplomatic cables again provided by

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,490
Chelsea Manning it really causes this

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,549
huge firestorm the US government

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:35,360
pressures financial organizations like

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:37,279
MasterCard and PayPal to block WikiLeaks

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,879
it was known as the banking blockade

00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:43,149
Amazon also pulled the plug on Sir

00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:47,679
says an anonymous anonymous this new

00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:50,919
wing comes in support of WikiLeaks and

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,109
basically initiates the largest

00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,169
distributed denial-of-service protests

00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:57,879
in the history of the web so freedom of

00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:00,940
expression is priceless for everything

00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:03,789
else there's MasterCard right and what

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,889
is really amazing about this moment

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,719
there's a couple of things first of all

00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:09,940
it was also a bit of an accident I'll

00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:12,639
tell you what it was very briefly anon

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:16,089
ops was only going to mirror WikiLeaks

00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:18,609
like many other geeks and organizations

00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:21,339
were doing but someone went ahead and

00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:24,879
ddosed PayPal they probably had access

00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:27,399
to a botnet they did it and then someone

00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:31,269
in the secret cabal because there's many

00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:35,529
but many cabal's in anonymous decides to

00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:37,619
claim that ddos as anon ops and so he

00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:40,690
went to a blogger and said that was us

00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:42,909
let the world know that that was us and

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,739
then this guy goes back to the little

00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:47,409
cabal who actually makes decisions

00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:48,999
through consensus and everyone is livid

00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,619
they're going to shred him to pieces or

00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:53,379
like that wasn't us we did not make this

00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:55,690
decision we're just mirroring WikiLeaks

00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:57,999
and then this savvy clever person said

00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,079
hey that ship was sailing I wanted to

00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:01,059
jump on that ship

00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,339
come on the media's all over this let's

00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:05,279
just say it was us and then finally

00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:09,459
they're like yeah let's say it was us

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,519
and then they decide to to try to claim

00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:15,849
at their own and also do a lot more

00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,019
ddossing right again imagine if that had

00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:19,299
never happened and this was quite

00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:22,769
significant because this detached

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:25,539
anonymous from questions of file-sharing

00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:28,269
also what was quite interesting was that

00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:32,499
the ddos was really only made possible

00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:35,699
by very cheap botnets that these hackers

00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:39,069
were venting or had control of but

00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:41,709
thousands of people were angered at this

00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:45,069
blockade and so thousands of people also

00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:47,199
joined this IRC channel there was 7,000

00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:50,529
people on one channel that's a lot of

00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:52,340
people there was over a hundred thousand

00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,710
people who downloaded

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,110
orbán ion cannon which was a tool that

00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,730
you can use to contribute to the ddos it

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,010
wasn't necessary and a lot of people

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,320
gotten a lot of trouble for using it but

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,419
it showed or made palpable the kind of

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,279
widespread discontent that people had

00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:10,610
with what the government and

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,010
corporations had done it was after this

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,110
that things got really interesting with

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,210
anonymous first of all this was the

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,610
architecture that anonymous took it

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,010
began to look like a Hydra they were

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,779
competing political nodes with different

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,169
political cultures there were regional

00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:30,980
nodes in Italy in India popping up it

00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:33,289
really became a complex geography and

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,270
then the other interesting element was

00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:38,330
that anonymous became anonymous

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,340
everywhere this was the time where along

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,429
with WikiLeaks they got involved in

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:46,340
Tunisia Zimbabwe Egypt Venezuela

00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:48,590
it was unbelievable the fountain of

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,620
activity that was coming out of

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,600
anonymous and following them basically

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,539
became my life

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,700
24 well not 24 hours a day but you know

00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:01,250
when I was awake and thankfully I was on

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,409
sabbatical that year otherwise my

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:07,399
teaching would have suffered quite a bit

00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:10,370
so then just very briefly you know

00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:13,750
anonymous mutates a lot it changes and

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:17,179
two of the big changes were in May of

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,899
2011 a number of the hackers who did a

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:22,399
lot of the political technical work

00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:25,190
decided to break away and form a group

00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:27,409
called LulzSec and the reason why they

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,899
broke away was Anonymous had become so

00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:31,610
associated with the activism that if

00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:34,220
they did hacking that didn't have a

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:37,039
political purpose people anonymous would

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,200
get upset so they decided to break away

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,970
with their own little group where they

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
would hack for the lulz for the fun of

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,789
it

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,740
and they went on a fifty day hacking

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:52,880
spree and hacked AT&T Sony Pictures a

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,409
bunch of video game companies and it was

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,039
interesting because even though many of

00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:59,600
the hacks had no overt political purpose

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,429
they were enacting a politics of

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,620
transgression they were also

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,779
demonstrating to the world the crappy

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,399
state of intranet security and

00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:10,940
were a little bit like a performance

00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:17,539
troupe as well they disbanded at the end

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:21,200
of June and then soon after through some

00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:23,539
leftover members created the group ante

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,379
SEC which unlike lull set became a

00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,969
political of militant hacker group

00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:31,609
militant in the sense that on Fridays

00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:33,919
they would try to target the governments

00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:38,539
for example and the hash tag for their

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:42,469
dump was FBI Fridays on Mondays it

00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:44,690
was you know Monday military meltdowns

00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:47,379
right like they were really just trying

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:52,389
to target governments and security firms

00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:55,339
and they they really went on a

00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:57,619
unbelievable hacking spree now I can't

00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:59,509
go into detail about all the operations

00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:01,879
under the banner of anonymous or

00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:05,269
lovesick or anti SEC but to give you a

00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:07,609
flavor of what anonymous does and how it

00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:10,279
does it I would like to just go in-depth

00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:12,440
for a second in one operation that I

00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:14,749
think is representative of the different

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,710
tactics that Anonymous uses in its

00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:21,830
operation Bart from August 2011 now this

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:25,129
happened after Bart's officials decided

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:27,200
to basically shut off cellphone access

00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:29,599
in their stations because local

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,320
activists were protesting Bart and the

00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:36,080
police after Charles Hill a homeless man

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:41,269
had been killed by a police officer and

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:45,099
so they were protesting Bay Area Rapid

00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:49,190
Transit sorry and they were protesting

00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:51,469
the killing of Charles Hill the local

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,359
activists and the Bay Area Transit was

00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:55,039
going to shut off cellphone access for

00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,710
the second protest in the hopes of

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,389
quelling protests so anonymous is like

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,119
Oh censorship we're going to get

00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:05,450
involved a small team called the cabin

00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:07,849
crew initiates it anon ops gets quite

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:12,200
involved like they often do what they do

00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:13,549
is engage in an organized street protest

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,739
this actually is not from the first

00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:19,690
protest this is the year anniversary but

00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:22,820
I just like the picture and it's also

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:26,630
paying homage to another man who had

00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:30,190
been killed before Charles Hill but they

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:33,470
also some people took the initiative oh

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,090
this was also during the protests and I

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,820
guess the point I was going to make with

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:41,150
this is that though many of their

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,990
tactics are legal they like to retain

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:46,760
their abrasive screw-you edge and I

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,490
think that this is a perfect example of

00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,950
that so along with protests some

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,860
individuals decide to hack into the Bay

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:58,130
Area Rapid Transit websites and they

00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:02,060
release customer data customers that had

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:04,070
nothing to do with the police brutality

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,260
and this of course causes enormous

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:09,110
controversy inside and outside of

00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:12,200
anonymous because generally let's just

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,990
say information is procured through

00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,150
hacking that reveals corruption most

00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,960
people anonymous are like down for that

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:23,030
if hacking has collateral damage there's

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,940
a few people who decide to move forward

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,610
with it for the purposes of media

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,690
attention this lands them literally on

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:34,280
CNN but this act initiated a press

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:38,120
release from anonymous that you know

00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,640
anonymous is not unanimous and finally

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,600
if someone can do something in the

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,630
classical style of trolling they often

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,060
will if they can and in in the case of

00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:53,480
operation Bart they were able to the

00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:56,210
gentleman who announced that Bart's was

00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,390
going to shut down cellphone access his

00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,880
name was Linton Johnson and he was the

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,710
public spokesperson for Bart and someone

00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:10,580
happened to find a photograph of him

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:14,030
that was a bit racy and published it on

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,410
a website called Bart lulz and said if

00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,240
you're going to be a dick to the public

00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,720
then I'm sure you don't mind showing

00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:23,240
your dick to the public Bart lols so I

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,730
think that this is a really good kind of

00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,200
example of the way in which Anonymous

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,630
integrates legal tactics

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,000
illegal tactics morally great tactics in

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,880
one operation this is not being

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,639
necessarily coordinated by the same

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,019
people although they may be on the same

00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:45,570
RC server okay now I just want to move

00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,340
away from a from their history and talk

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,460
a little bit about your kind of

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,409
sociology and their political

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,860
significance I don't have time to go

00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:59,700
into this I'm going to skip that so

00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,720
initially it was it was quite fun to

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,200
study anonymous

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,279
it was quite pleasurable it really is a

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,679
unusual subversive subcultural world but

00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,970
eventually this was definitely not a

00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,980
mother cracking game with over a hundred

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:20,490
arrests around the world there were

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,529
about two dozen people in the United

00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,380
States who were arrested with numerous

00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:28,080
numerous convictions and it's so

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,149
significant the number of arrests again

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,610
in North America and Europe in much of

00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,710
the world that a number of the lawyers

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,980
who are representing people from

00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:40,500
anonymous have called this moment the

00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,960
nerd scare that is something like the

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,480
Red Scare where the US government went

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,179
after and demonized communists during

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,409
the McCarthy era and I would like to

00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:55,350
mention it's not simply just anonymous

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:57,899
that is targeted as part of this nerd

00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:01,380
scare I think a great example of this is

00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:03,929
Peter Sunde who is part of the Pirate

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,330
Bay who's currently in jail in Sweden

00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:08,820
serving a year sentence simply for

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:11,909
running the Pirate Bay

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,929
you know with Anonymous if you're going

00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:15,210
to have arrests

00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:19,139
it also means that there's a lot of

00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:22,350
snitches that are obviously going to be

00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:27,090
within anonymous and one of the most

00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:28,860
famous was this fellow here actor

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,980
monster gear who was better known as

00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:35,580
Sabu who was part of LulzSec who had

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,309
been arrested in June and the day of his

00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,429
arrest he flipped and became an

00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:43,159
informants and he would

00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:45,110
really pivotal in catching a lot of the

00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,470
hackers who were arrested in the United

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,820
States and the UK probably the most

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:53,149
significant of all of them with Jeremy

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:56,090
Hammond who is currently serving a ten

00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:58,759
year sentence for hacking many kind of

00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:00,769
American corporations so that's

00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,259
obviously something that's part of the

00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:05,960
sociological landscape but what has been

00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:07,879
interesting is that even though there's

00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,520
been major arrests even though their

00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:14,139
snitches everywhere Anonymous has not

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:21,169
been entirely stopped they're quite

00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:23,929
strong and going strong and I decided to

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:26,690
kind of make a list of ingredients that

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:29,629
kind of can help explain the secret

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:33,379
sauce of Anonymous's success and here it

00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:35,510
is so I think part of the reason they're

00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:38,599
successful is because they have bold and

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:41,839
recognizable Hollywood aesthetics there

00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,119
is a really kind of strong participatory

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,669
open thrust in Anonymous which I'll get

00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:50,030
to they function like an anti brand

00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:52,639
brand there's a lot of mystique and

00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,919
misinformation that helps create a drama

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,899
so people want to follow them they

00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:59,839
they'll and a tremendous amount of media

00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:02,920
attention but I think the most important

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:07,730
has to do with their unpredictability

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,760
and in fact if there was one word if I

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,549
had to pick one word to describe

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,520
anonymous it would definitely be

00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:18,920
mercurial they're changeable volatile

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,040
fickle flighty erratic animated lively

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,960
sprightly quick-witted these kind of

00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,329
characteristics really capture what

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,890
Anonymous is about and what's

00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:30,200
interesting is that I don't think that

00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,559
they're random there's many logics to

00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:37,400
anonymous but they're very malleable and

00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:39,109
fickle and flighty and this kind of set

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,710
of characteristics is not unique to

00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:46,190
anonymous either in fact if you know

00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:50,349
about trickster lore the trickster being

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:51,570
figures like coyote or Anansi the spider

00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,960
or

00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:57,450
or Loki if you've seen you know Thor the

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,640
Hollywood film tricksters kind of

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:04,110
embodied these characteristics and in my

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:07,470
book I do a lot of kind of conceptual

00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:10,320
work of relating the trickster to

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,600
anonymous but these characteristics are

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,610
really animated by they're an amazing

00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,440
artwork which on the one hand is

00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:22,560
functions like memes and so far as their

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,590
stock images that are just tweaked and

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,080
redone so a lot of people can contribute

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:30,090
on the other hand there is a kind of a

00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,060
lot of artistry that goes into it and

00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,860
their videos in particular as we've seen

00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,950
whether it's that first Scientology

00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,960
video or the videos that they create for

00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,520
their operations are incredibly

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,830
important

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,410
just like with any kind of domain of

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:49,080
political organizing you have to have

00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:51,750
teamwork and that is no different in

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:55,350
Anonymous and it comes at many different

00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:58,110
levels so for example Anonymous is often

00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:00,420
described as being hackers hackers

00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:02,490
hackers and hackers hackers hackers and

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,540
in fact compared to something like

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,920
Debian

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,140
actually what makes Anonymous

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,390
distinctive is that many people are not

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,950
hackers many people who show up our

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:15,210
students and janitors video makers

00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:17,460
designers like people with really

00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,740
different backgrounds and one of the

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,980
reasons why they've had such a forceful

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,560
presence is because they're quite good

00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:27,750
on mediums like Twitter and one of the

00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,600
biggest activist accounts in the

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,880
english-speaking leftist world is your

00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,310
anonymous news it's got over 1 million

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,160
followers and this is based and

00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:41,430
predicated on teamwork they've had up to

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,730
25 people behind the team there's a

00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,770
style guide there's rules and consensus

00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:50,070
they have to follow there's big dramas

00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:52,590
they explode they get reconstituted

00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,590
right so that's really important and

00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,480
then of course wealth sec ante sec you

00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:01,380
know there's a lot of teamwork that goes

00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,300
into anonymous another kind of

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,569
factor behind their success is their

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:10,839
openness they really combined an

00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:13,210
open-source logic in the context of

00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:15,309
organizational obscurity or downright

00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:19,150
secrecy and I know that this may not

00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:21,160
seem like a pair that can go together

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,230
like how can something be really open

00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,050
and also really secret at the same time

00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:30,099
right and it's because it's two

00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:33,700
different elements that are in play

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:36,730
so really Anonymous is this idea that

00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:39,430
cannot be controlled it's free for

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:42,819
anyone to take and I think it was really

00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:45,550
embodied well when Jake Davis who was

00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:48,280
known also as topiary a member of

00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:51,790
LulzSec before he was arrested he

00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,059
tweeted you cannot arrest an idea and

00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:57,670
this is the only tweet that now stands

00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:59,950
on that old account and what this has

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:04,119
meant is that you have anonymous in

00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:06,790
Indonesia in Singapore in Canada right

00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:10,089
it really is this Commons for anyone to

00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,890
take and there are limits to who can who

00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:14,680
can take it I once heard a good story

00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:17,770
from some intelligence officers who told

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,390
me that jihadist actually admired

00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,990
anonymous for all the media attention

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:25,450
they got but really they probably

00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,910
couldn't embrace the idea of anonymous

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,549
or lulz right the cultural differences

00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:33,010
between kind of jihadist terrorists and

00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:34,990
anonymous are too big so it doesn't mean

00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:38,230
anonymous can travel anywhere and

00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:40,660
everywhere but nevertheless it has real

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,799
wide appeal and can circulate and I

00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,079
think the crysta

00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:48,760
the most crystallized example of this

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:51,849
was when Polish parliamentarians who

00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,190
were protesting the anti-counterfeiting

00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:56,140
trade agreements which was being

00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,210
considered in Europe

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,130
well they protested it and one of the

00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:03,040
ways that they protested it was by

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:06,010
taking the anonymous mask now they

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,339
weren't claiming to be anonymous but by

00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:12,640
this time the mask had become equated

00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:14,190
with popular descents and again was a

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,319
symbol that could travel

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,500
in many different parts in the world and

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:25,020
it was because no one claims ownership

00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:27,930
over it however the architecture of the

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,960
actual networks like Anan ops is like a

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:34,140
maze it's unbelievably complex there's

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,119
cabal's within cabal's it makes the

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:40,410
cabal's and Debian look like child's

00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,579
playing in comparison I mean to give you

00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,920
one example

00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,710
there was once a channel that I believe

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,549
was called kitten core which at first I

00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,710
thought was about cat porn but it wasn't

00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:55,020
and there was another one called

00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:58,140
upper deck and they had the same exact

00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:00,059
people - one person because at the time

00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,710
they were splitting bitcoins and this

00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:03,900
was a new person and they didn't trust

00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,460
them and so for a while you have like

00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,450
these two channels that are exactly the

00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:11,369
same - one person right and really the

00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,049
only reason why I've come to know about

00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:15,359
many of the cabal's is because people

00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:17,130
were arrested and they were able to talk

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,069
freely in a way that they weren't able

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:24,089
to do so before and even though I've

00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:26,250
written a really big book I feel like

00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:29,010
I've only captured like a fraction of

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:32,880
this maze and that's what it really felt

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:35,069
like so now I just want to move to the

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,980
ethics and politics of anonymity

00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:39,569
you know whenever Anonymous intervenes

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,880
in a certain area of the world or

00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:45,119
operation there's an effect to their

00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,309
operation but at a more meta level I

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,500
think Anonymous is really interesting

00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:52,289
because they came into being just at the

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,650
moment where anonymity and privacy are

00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:58,770
truly going extinct and dying and

00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:02,130
possibly are going away and sometimes I

00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:05,730
really do think Anonymous is simply the

00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:07,529
kind of party at the funeral of privacy

00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,559
you might as well go out having a good

00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:12,990
time if you're going to do it but what

00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,079
is really fascinating is not simply that

00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:18,900
they incarnate visually this importance

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,420
of privacy and anonymity but that there

00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:25,029
is an extremely robust anti celebrity

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,849
ethic that

00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:29,919
at the heart of anonymous and I think

00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:33,579
that there's real strong virtue in

00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:37,059
embracing opacity eligibility anti

00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:40,029
celebrity in the age of celebrity and

00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:43,869
surveillance and there were many many

00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:47,759
kind of examples in which people who

00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:50,380
were seen to kind of be acting for fame

00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:52,869
recognition or who was who were self

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,789
promoting were literally kicked out

00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:57,459
banished chastised

00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:59,829
thrown to the corner as a result of

00:42:57,459 --> 00:43:02,709
doing so this was really a living ethic

00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:04,929
and I have many instances it instances

00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:07,119
in my book and I'll just give you right

00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:09,669
now a short conversation happening

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,839
between one person accusing another

00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:16,449
person who D mast of trying to seek fame

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,999
and recognition and again there's gonna

00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:21,819
be some strong language so this person

00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:24,400
says hey II can I say you really love

00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:25,839
attention or just some wannabe you know

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,809
would be surprised if you're not some

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,939
 fed just like Sabu who was this

00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:33,549
person working as the informant the

00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:36,339
other person tries to defend himself say

00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:37,989
whatever you want but you you'd be wrong

00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:40,599
and then this person says you're like

00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:44,439
this other person on Twitter who seeks

00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:46,749
attention and so really this was

00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:51,159
something that was really incredibly

00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:54,969
important now another logic of anonymity

00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:57,729
that is alive in anonymous actually has

00:43:54,969 --> 00:44:01,029
a very long heritage and it has to do

00:43:57,729 --> 00:44:04,109
with the fact that speaking anonymously

00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:07,259
is important for the vibrancy of

00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:10,689
democratic societies and this has been

00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:13,089
enshrined in the Supreme Court probably

00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:19,059
my favorite example is captured in a

00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:20,890
frizam by Oscar Wilde who says man is

00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,669
least himself when he talks in his own

00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,249
person

00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:26,679
give him a mask and he'll tell you the

00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:31,509
truth but I think that there is a pretty

00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:34,390
strong sentiment as well that's acting

00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:36,759
anonymously is cowardly this is

00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,180
something I hear quite a bit sometimes

00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:40,100
when people are critical

00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,410
I actually disagree I think that there's

00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:45,560
good political reasons to try to protect

00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:47,660
yourself and I think at its best

00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,960
anonymity puts the attention on the

00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,940
message rather than the messenger and in

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,280
many cases when it comes to political

00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,320
movements whether it's in the past or

00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:03,500
it's in the present so here we have

00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,030
Hoffman who was one of the founders of

00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,200
the hippies which is a kind of

00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:11,690
countercultural 1960s pranking sort of

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,030
movements who was made into a celebrity

00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,880
leader Abbie Hoffman and then there's

00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:18,830
Julian Assange who was very much kind of

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,840
embraced by the media and Julian put

00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:24,260
himself in the spotlight and in both

00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:27,080
instances when the leader is tarnished

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,270
his or her reputation the whole movement

00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:33,440
can be tarnished so there's real kind of

00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:36,620
powerful reasons why one might want to

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,560
embrace anonymity in in political acts

00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:42,740
but a final kind of element about

00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:45,110
anonymous interactions when you're doing

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,050
it politically in small groups is that

00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:50,090
there's a great psychological burden

00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:52,910
when you're interacting with others very

00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:55,250
closely but you can't share much about

00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:57,610
your life with each other and in fact

00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:01,390
some of the hackers who were caught

00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:04,010
simply share too much about their lives

00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,350
because they couldn't sort of hold back

00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:08,870
when you are under such intense

00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:12,490
conditions you want to talk about your

00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:15,230
you know past and your and your desires

00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:18,020
and what you've done and and this is

00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:21,500
exactly what people did because it's

00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:24,290
truly hard to remain truly anonymous and

00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:27,920
the next quote I'm showing you is from a

00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:30,950
hacker who did manage to remain

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,470
anonymous and he's never been caught but

00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:38,000
he was telling me what they how hard it

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:40,490
was to bear that burden and he said the

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,740
hardest is the silence when we have

00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,630
trouble and stress unlike family or work

00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,600
tensions there's no one to talk to knew

00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:50,330
no friends who understand or who I trust

00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,040
with it the advantage is that anons can

00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,840
resurrect you can go away

00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,540
they come back with a new name if you

00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,940
don't share anything for you he was

00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,630
talking to me I'll keep following Biela

00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:06,940
there's no neck changes for you and so

00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:10,790
it is definitely not necessarily easy to

00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:12,800
work under the veil so just to finish

00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,440
now I'm just going to talk very briefly

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,260
about weapons of the geek and

00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:22,340
contextualize anonymous within this

00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:24,830
larger field very briefly this title is

00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,900
inspired by an anthropology book called

00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:28,880
weapons of the week every day forms of

00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,530
peasant resistance in which an

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,460
anthropologist by the name of James

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:38,120
Scott looked at interventions like minor

00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:40,520
acts of sabotage or foot-dragging that

00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,190
on the surface do not look political

00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:46,160
it's someone being difficult at work for

00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:49,100
example but his arguments is that in the

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,050
aggregate they do have political effects

00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,870
and that in many different peasant

00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,910
societies there's many different types

00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:58,640
of weapons of the week but they all

00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:03,440
share some similar characteristics and

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:06,380
in part inspired by the fact that in the

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,630
last aid and especially the last five

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,390
years there's been this unbelievable

00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:14,990
kind of flowering of hacker political

00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:17,140
activity I am really interested in what

00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:19,850
are the points of similarity and

00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,550
differences between let's just say the

00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:24,020
world of free and open source software

00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:26,240
radical tech collectives the pirate

00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:29,030
party the whistleblowers right what

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,800
unites hacker and geek politics and in

00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,200
what ways are the different modalities

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,920
quite different and I was really struck

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,600
by Zacks earlier talk because on the one

00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,030
hand I think that there are these two

00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,720
opposing trends on the one hand there

00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:47,240
are these very very strong forces of

00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:50,240
depolarization in the hacker world I

00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:53,750
think also bolstered by startup culture

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,530
as well but on the other hand there's

00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:59,720
also been this unbelievable flowering of

00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:04,190
kind of very direct action politics in

00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,840
the hacker world and so first of all

00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,870
just very briefly in term

00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:11,900
some of the similarities some of the

00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:14,090
similarities or not so much similarities

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:17,150
but one way to account for the fact that

00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:19,910
we have a kind of explosion of hacker

00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:22,940
politics today has to do with the fact

00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:25,400
that courage is contagious right you

00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:28,310
have these very dramatic acts such as

00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,640
what Chelsea Manning did giving all this

00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:34,460
information to WikiLeaks and what Julian

00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:38,360
Assange did and that literally inspired

00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:41,390
Jeremy Hammond in anonymous to return to

00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:44,510
political hacking we know probably that

00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:47,090
Edward Snowden was at least partly

00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,550
inspired by what came before him right

00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:51,020
so these very visible acts and this is

00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:53,030
very different from weapons of the week

00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,640
which are very invisible hacker politics

00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:57,980
weapons of the geek are very visible on

00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,960
the other hand and this visibility has

00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:08,180
allowed for this kind of courageousness

00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:11,600
to be infectious now I think there's

00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:14,780
about a half a dozen characteristics

00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:17,900
that help explain some of the different

00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:20,540
connections between something like the

00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,820
pirate party The Pirate Bay

00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:25,190
Debian and Anonymous and don't worry I'm

00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,650
not going to go into all six of them but

00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:30,890
I'm going to mention one of them and one

00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,390
element that I do see marking hacker and

00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:36,050
geek politics is different from other

00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:39,770
domains is that hackers often work on

00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:41,870
projects together and they're there

00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,900
different motivations don't get in the

00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:47,410
way of achieving a goal so people go to

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:50,450
projects for very different reasons and

00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:52,460
additionally their offline political

00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,380
affiliation like are they Social

00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,930
Democrats or they're libertarian are

00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:59,690
they anarchists that tends not to matter

00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:01,580
so much for many different domains of

00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,550
hacker politics whether that's Debian or

00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:07,100
anonymous and generally I think that's a

00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:09,800
really powerful thing and to give you a

00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:12,500
great example of this in action I'm

00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,420
going to show a very short clip from a

00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,640
movie on The Pirate Bay

00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,530
where each of the three kind of main

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,070
people behind the Pirate Bay

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:25,270
they are explaining why they contribute

00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:28,490
to this project and each one of them has

00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:33,470
wildly different reasons it's in Swedish

00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:35,750
so there's subtitles at the bottom oh I

00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,780
actually have to escape it because it's

00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:46,340
too large

00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:49,100
okay cyclin Oh Satan and he'll tomb

00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:51,230
citizens corpuscle I'm gonna Alva Ivy

00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:56,660
Leaguers integer something's in sportin

00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:58,760
I didn't say it wrong if I helped your

00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:01,070
schoolers snipe attractor for some

00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,530
franticness perspective of them Rhiannon

00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:08,630
familias chanced familiy chest yeah

00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:10,970
circa Monica home yeah your brain of a

00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,120
kingdom in your game or computer copying

00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:16,210
a loop to stress the mounting

00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:20,090
realpolitik you're you're half the

00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:22,400
current society where the victim i repel

00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:26,300
you the democrat the sierra MagnaCare

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:28,730
the skarner bra third setting for it on

00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,560
the fee hit proof let's go through that

00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:32,570
in matthew all it at your are there some

00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,610
paper your l think is the re-emerged

00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,160
certainty until individual today LMAO

00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:39,890
material ever known the opposite freedom

00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,250
now they and rocky felt felt to be a

00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:50,540
model let it came almost a diskette here

00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:51,890
okay so they're under oath i just like

00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,200
that slide for weapons of the geek

00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,220
they're under oath I have no reason but

00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,350
to believe them

00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:00,850
the first person is interested because

00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:02,960
he wants to run a neutral political

00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,550
neutral communication infrastructure

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,500
this and by the way

00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,060
anakata is another person who's been

00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,770
caught up in the nerd scare he was in

00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,780
solitary confinement for quite a while

00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,940
I'm not even completely sure why he's in

00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,270
jail but he's someone else who's in jail

00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:19,850
the middle person is into it because

00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:22,280
it's fun and then Peter Sunde is like

00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:25,190
this is political for me and I see that

00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,280
in many different domains of hacker

00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:30,289
action you have that kind of extreme

00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,019
flexibility and Malian

00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:37,789
ability and I actually think that this

00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:40,489
is generally a really positive thing but

00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:42,079
there are some limits to it as well at

00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:45,650
times and this is what I'm going to I

00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:48,499
promise finish would you know I think

00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,279
it's really interesting with weapons of

00:53:48,499 --> 00:53:52,249
the week

00:53:49,279 --> 00:53:56,179
I mean geek you have these very

00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:58,400
different domains like free software

00:53:56,179 --> 00:54:00,890
like anonymous like whistleblowing and

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,679
there's these amazing moments where they

00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:06,679
cross pollinate and I'm going to show to

00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:10,519
finish a video by Edward Snowden who

00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:13,309
basically videoed into hackers on planet

00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:16,759
earth and he basically pays massive

00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:18,799
homage to free software installment and

00:54:16,759 --> 00:54:24,199
he talks about the importance of

00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:26,630
creating technological tools for the

00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:29,719
fight against surveillance and basically

00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:32,779
he's issuing a call to arms and the

00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:35,179
question now is what free software

00:54:32,779 --> 00:54:37,849
developers what Debian is going to do in

00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:41,329
response and there seems to be a strong

00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:45,829
need to bake in security defaults that

00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:49,150
provide enhanced privacy to protect and

00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:52,669
enable things like crypto so that

00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:55,219
governments cannot so easily snoop on

00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:57,829
the population and I think that this is

00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:59,829
a really important call but one of the

00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:03,589
things is that this can't necessarily

00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:06,169
arise magically but needs to be a kind

00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:08,779
of concerted effort if not for a whole

00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:10,459
project at least a team in a project in

00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:13,119
order to make it happen

00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:16,369
we're basically different motivations

00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,739
need to align in order to make it happen

00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:21,529
but again what I really like about this

00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:25,999
final video that I'm going to show is

00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:29,239
that different areas of hacker politics

00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:32,329
do cross pollinate do come together do

00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:35,719
speak to each other and again Snowden is

00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:37,489
a perfect example but the limits or the

00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:40,189
problem is that he's just in an

00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:42,390
individual who did a tremendous amount

00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:44,369
by exposing

00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,299
this kind of blanket surveillance and

00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:50,039
the kind of close relationship between

00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:52,859
corporations and governments but he's

00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:55,049
very well aware that there are armies of

00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:58,549
geeks and hackers and it is they who

00:55:55,049 --> 00:56:02,549
could find who can finish the kind of

00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:05,039
job that is necessary to restore privacy

00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:08,130
if not we're definitely just going to be

00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:11,190
at the party at the funeral of anonymity

00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:14,670
and privacy so to finish I'm just going

00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:17,430
to play the video and then I realize

00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:19,440
I've gone over time so we can just break

00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,809
it up but if people have any questions

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:30,869
or comments I'll definitely be around

00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:32,670
afterwards topic and I think when we

00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:36,329
talk about whether or not the government

00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:37,650
begins going after journalists this is

00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:41,130
the real sticking point for me because

00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:44,760
in terms of my political philosophy as

00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:47,640
it relates to technology here is I would

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:51,690
say almost all men ask when we think

00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:54,480
about speech laughter when we think

00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:56,880
about free software we need to think

00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,000
about software as a means of expressing

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,940
our freedom but also defending our

00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,400
freedom governments rely on the same

00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:08,039
technologies we do they adopt the same

00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:12,059
standards they use the same problems and

00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:17,430
this happens worldwide so the solution

00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:19,650
to that when you ask me is whether or

00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:22,109
not the United States government can

00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,910
manage to behave itself to restrain

00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,950
itself against violating the

00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:28,470
Constitution against bringing suits

00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:30,359
against journalists against limiting the

00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:32,789
freedom press other governments will

00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,990
make different decisions and if we want

00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:36,450
to live in a better more enlightened

00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:39,089
world what we need to do is we need to

00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:41,690
remove those capabilities from the

00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:44,099
governments by enshrining our rights

00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:46,710
into our means of communications by

00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:49,289
denying them those capabilities at least

00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:51,359
on a massive untargeted level because

00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:52,920
you know you can't pitch his zero day at

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,390
every mobile song whatever computer

00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,530
that's out there or it's gonna get

00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:57,450
caught it's gonna be

00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,390
a final research it's gonna end up on

00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:03,390
you know the verge Ars Technica or any

00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:04,650
one of these other sites and there's

00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,300
gonna be a post-mortem their mouth

00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,380
that's gonna be reused and repurpose

00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,920
their to find it out then you trace back

00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:13,830
to you um but governments can still

00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,330
pursue their legitimate needs for law

00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:18,150
enforcement for intelligence collection

00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:20,820
on a targeted basis by using those zero

00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:23,580
days only when they are the least

00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:26,490
intrusive and essential means of getting

00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:29,790
okay so he goes off a little bit but I

00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:33,770
just wanted to end there and just thank

00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:36,060
everyone for the work they do and again

00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:38,910
gonna be here all week so if you have

00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,740
any questions or comments um help happy

00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:42,900
to engage and take them thank you very

00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:58,820
much

00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:58,820
