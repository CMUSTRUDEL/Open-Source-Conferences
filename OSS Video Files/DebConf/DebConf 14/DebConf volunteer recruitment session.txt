	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,549
for the audience someone for the speaker

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,870
and then somebody with a microphone move

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,269
in d yeah

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,880
for whoever asked and this actually

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,130
helps the people you know yeah that

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,750
couldn't make it to the VN 2 to the 2

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,470
that comes to actually follow the talk

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:24,269
and usually they they quite appreciate

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,400
it and the video team provide training

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,210
so there's no requirement at all to have

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,130
video experience or camera experience

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,840
anything like that you can just say it's

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,329
son something it sounds fun to do and

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,329
you also get a special yellow t-shirt

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:54,649
there's a question in the audience or in

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:57,059
the participants rather over here or

00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:00,870
intervention from the from it from

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,520
someone my microphone please I know I

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,930
think this is not really necessary for

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,549
this session necessarily but let's get

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,510
into the habit of using the microphone

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:15,689
correctly hi my name is Roy Wright so

00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:17,970
this is more of an inquiry about not

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,689
specifically with you but I kind of

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:26,460
interested in photography stills

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,090
and while I see the hard efforts of the

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,780
video team

00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,670
not sure if they're really like oh so

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,229
maybe if we had the microphone to the

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,229
person sitting at the front of the room

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,429
yeah I'm I guess basically the photo

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:49,060
team yeah but I think you can probably

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,829
take more members exactly yeah I've been

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,130
running around and taking pictures of

00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:56,439
everything and so most of the time I end

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,619
up missing most of the talks so if

00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:02,110
somebody else would take up some of the

00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,450
slack and have more pictures taken that

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:12,790
that would that improve the coverage

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:15,880
perfectly and reduce the stress how do

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,180
you plan to publish the photos and so

00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,180
forth

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,790
well yeah photos are basically all from

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,230
the previous day are already published

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,630
and my Google+ stream and I'm tweeting

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,549
them and posting to our sea and stuff

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,350
like that and they'll be promoted

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,239
through more official channels later on

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:42,519
as well especially when they were

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:45,160
finished for all of that yeah as far how

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,230
to cooperate explicitly with the with

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,560
the other photographers taking taking

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:53,350
pictures that specific point has not

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:59,850
been worked upon yet before so and

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:59,850
that's a very open area of coordination

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,680
have you ever been involved as a

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:10,780
photographer of that for several

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:14,380
editions of Def Con for all the ones

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:19,180
that have been to which is how many

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,450
years unfortunately since Oslo yeah I

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:28,209
think that's Darfur

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:33,959
Oslo was 2003 three so yeah for a long

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,959
time but yeah there's there's plenty of

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,230
plenty of moments to take and not enough

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,410
eyes to see them and not enough cameras

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,290
to take them maybe it's not the key

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,910
focus of day of the conference but it

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,380
helps for people to also at the

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,170
conference to see what's what's

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,820
happening be where the cameras don't

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,280
have the coverage the video cameras

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,770
don't have the coverage and also see

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,300
some some more details and more insights

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:07,290
as well you may have been involved or

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,660
attending some kampf have you like been

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,459
differences in in the photography

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,070
aspects so to speak like or have you you

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,000
mentioned you were more or less their

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,460
only photographer here right

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,850
artistic a that confess is kind of are

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,060
you used to this or have it like give a

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:34,220
little historical perspective basically

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:37,500
well back to the the topic of this of

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,470
encouraging volunteers but when I

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:45,210
started a came to deviant games Beppe

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,919
conf I'm not a great coder let's just

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,390
say it like that I'm much better at

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:55,229
taking photos and what I what I try to

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,440
focus on at Def Con is try to provide as

00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:01,500
best photo coverage so that the rest of

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,510
the of the participants don't feel the

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,540
need to bring their cameras and take

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,120
pictures so that they can focus more on

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,990
the coding and I feel that by this way I

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:17,370
I can provide more overall code impact

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:21,539
than by coding myself and so that's the

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,940
that's why I became involved so one of

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,690
the ways that people can get involved in

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,210
volunteer for Def Con for always to see

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,090
what people what color what people are

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,850
in depth that would like to be coding

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:40,039
what are they doing instead of coding

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:42,529
and maybe you can help them reduce that

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,619
non-productive time

00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:47,659
and help with that I found the

00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:50,259
photographer Aneesh maybe there is some

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:52,879
other things that are not covered and

00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:55,399
you know maybe somebody else can you can

00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:59,119
find something else yes I mean a lot of

00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:01,399
the most of the volunteer jobs during

00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:03,109
DEFCON of our non-technical ones there

00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,169
are in fact some technical things that

00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:07,729
need help as well if you are sitting in

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:09,229
this room but really looking for a new

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,139
technical project then there are things

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:14,539
like helping with the improving the

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,829
conference management system where

00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:18,259
there's actually been some coding time

00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:20,509
during this week to fix a couple of

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,489
things even the find they were noticed

00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:23,479
during def cons but most of the roles

00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:25,759
are non-technical things I mean other

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,139
things you can see again if you walk

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,669
around the conference you'll see people

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,519
doing different things like for example

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,509
the front desk ice at the moment the

00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,519
front desk actually seemed to have

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,679
already found a lot of volunteers by

00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,359
recruiting people as they arrived so I

00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:40,849
don't know if they heavily need people

00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:42,019
or not but certainly that's something

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,999
that people some people may be

00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:49,699
interested in if they've if they're more

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:55,579
he wants to say something oh yeah yeah

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:58,159
yeah great there are lots of things

00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,539
where I just another point about with a

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,849
volunteering yet because it's just that

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,699
a lot of times there's you can spot

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:07,969
something needs done or in fact some

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:10,009
local team person may just be looking

00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,539
for someone to help do something boring

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,319
like carry some stuff around and

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,479
obviously most people are kind of

00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,529
willing to do that but again it's good

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,349
if there's some people who are really

00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,609
actively kind of looking out for little

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,399
instances where they can help and just

00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:27,229
make sure everything work smoothly I

00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,999
think there will still be some extra

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:31,789
volunteers possibly wanted for things

00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:33,469
like helping get people to the right

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,899
place on the day trip this kind of thing

00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:37,339
as well I and the cheese and wine party

00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:39,739
as well yeah the cheese and wine party

00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:42,889
should I expect students volunteers

00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:45,139
that's another important event in the

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,299
DEF CON calendar can we pass the

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:51,409
microphone over here then for to hear

00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:53,169
something about front desk work so front

00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,120
desk is a very easy place to volunteer

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:58,120
we usually have one

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,370
who has access to the the internal

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,960
system where you have to tick off the

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,850
people who have registered but the main

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,919
thing we need help with is just pulling

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,330
out the right t-shirt size pulling up

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,669
the person's badge

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,070
we've kind of got an assembly line going

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:14,500
for that you also get people wandering

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,919
up just looking for help like where do I

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,300
find the room for this session or what's

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,770
coming up on the schedule so we have

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,320
like a printed piece there so a lot of

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,419
it the rest of its just kind of pointing

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,820
people in the right direction that's

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:32,349
pretty much it so after the people well

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,900
isn't doesn't want to ask a question

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,900
back about that or you kind of happy

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,500
maybe you can repeat the question as

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,390
well on the microphone he's asking how

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,310
did I get involved in front desk I'm

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,810
actually one of the local organizers for

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,310
this year so that's why I'm helping out

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:52,600
but there's other folks who just

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,540
wandered up instead of volunteering so I

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,760
think that's we can probably let you get

00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,920
back if you're if you want but out to

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,100
the people in this room are there people

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,420
who are Jen who has the kind of if the

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,010
article purpose of this session should

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,910
be are genuinely looking for something

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:12,520
to do or are you is a people too scared

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,830
to where is that raise I have to admit

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,810
that I see some new phrases to me but I

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,640
don't know whether you're just using the

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,459
rimless somewhere convenient to IRC from

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,850
or whether you actually would like to

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:26,320
find an episome volunteer thing to do if

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,380
there's anyone in particular then we can

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,029
probably find you something that's all

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,820
but if you prefer to lurk that's also

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:36,370
fine there's anyone raising their hand

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,110
apparently not so for the people other

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,520
people I see quite since I see quite a

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,410
lot of people in the room who are I

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:46,180
think actually have been around in Deaf

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:48,760
conf and in Debian for some time while

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,830
leaving open the option for anyone to

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,470
jump up and say I really need to find

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,620
something to fill my time on Tuesday

00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:00,190
afternoon or whatever it happens to be I

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,140
was gonna say a little bit about the

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,360
fact that some of the people in the room

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:08,279
I know are again long-term Def Con

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,560
participants and may have helped too

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,970
our greater degrees at different

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,649
individual comps but as well as helping

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,480
at the dev cons we are also always

00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,240
looking for people to get involved more

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,290
with the longer term year-to-year

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,579
debconf processes although clearly a lot

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,939
of the work needs to be done by people

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:32,999
who are local to actually be able to go

00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:35,069
and speak face-to-face with venue

00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,839
managers or this kind of thing there's a

00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,970
lot of stuff in dev comp that happens

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,410
that makes the conference a success when

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,029
it happens but it's done in advance

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:46,319
remotely this is that this talk can you

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,389
tell me when it's big enough to actually

00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:50,879
read anything I don't know how bad or

00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:54,629
good people's eyesight are is is that

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:57,449
legible okay so I mean this is a page in

00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:01,649
the dev conf wiki with the imaginative

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:02,999
title of jobs and this was a load of

00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,319
different ways people can help on

00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:05,790
different things again some of these

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,819
alessa's things that are better done

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,300
locally although even within those areas

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:14,250
it's actually good if people from who've

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,779
got longer-term debt kampf experience

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,809
also get involved to give advice and

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:21,839
help do things that's things like the

00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:24,779
venue arrangements helping people

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,339
arrange that go get traveled information

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:30,559
helping people get visas if they're

00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,519
coming to some country that requires it

00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,600
there's a lot of things actually where

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,980
we we really don't have enough

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,899
volunteers at the moment for some of

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,309
these boring tasks I say boring but I'm

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,050
sure they are very very interesting if

00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:43,259
you can approach them in the right

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,149
manner so Martin was saying that he's

00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,059
been doing for example some of the kind

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:50,370
of accounting for debconf and that's the

00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,300
kind of thing where it's really vital to

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,529
have it happen but it's hard often in a

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,970
out of the set of people who are just

00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,100
coming to a DEFCON play it's hard to

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,220
find some find people who have the right

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,170
experience and the right and are willing

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,819
to actually spend time to do that even

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,920
though clearly is completely vital that

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,970
we have a good set of accounts to show

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,730
where the money is actually gone at the

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,319
end of the conference the same ID I

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,940
think at this I don't think actually

00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:16,650
this year we have a we

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,630
managed to get a real volunteer to do

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,130
kind of invent specifically to do

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,100
inventory tracking for example that just

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,010
means keeping track of all the equipment

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,540
that we put into the into the building

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,690
lots of which comes for is lent from

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,700
into individual people or comes from

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,700
some standard Debian equipment used from

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,140
year to year that's an example it's

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,820
really good to have some years we've had

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,010
someone who focused on that and made

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,930
sure everything was labeled and listed

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,970
and documented and then at the end of

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,920
the conference it's and very easy to get

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,120
it all back to the right place in the

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,500
years when that doesn't happen you

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,170
suddenly find that three years later

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,330
your start trying to get the power strip

00:12:52,170 --> 00:13:00,780
back to someone or whatever happens to

00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:01,890
be conference volunteers stuff is what I

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,170
was talking about to start with but

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,000
again at the moment we again kind of

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,420
don't have enough people well we tend to

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,790
get people to do the individual jobs the

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,580
task of coordinating those people tends

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,440
just to fall back on the local team

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,840
people so here is kind of falls back on

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,600
maybe Steven pati but they obviously

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,890
actually have a lot of other things that

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,570
they should they have need to think

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,660
about during the conference period so

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,980
again if if we have anyone who's

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,750
interested in just helping to coordinate

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,850
other volunteers that's also something

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:39,350
that we could really do with more help

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:41,790
on this year we don't have a specific oh

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,400
oh Debbie and they are open day from the

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,200
conference but again in some years

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,670
someone has taken has taken that of

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,100
saying well how can we really try to

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,330
interact with the local community in the

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,640
place where we're holding the conference

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,350
and maybe have a day with where the

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,140
talks that are scheduled that that day

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,580
are more ones that are more more

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,339
understandable from people from outside

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,600
the project morale general interest to

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:08,220
people interested in free software but

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,780
again it's something that it kind of

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,420
when it's happened in the past is mostly

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,890
fallen back on the local team people to

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,900
do it but they have so many other

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,310
priorities in the period leading up to

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,330
DEFCON four that is if we're going to

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,490
have it it's something that could really

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,550
do with someone who wants to push that

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,940
from year to year maybe he's even if

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,940
they're remote

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,630
the day-tripping conference dinner tend

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,250
to be actually something is quite fun

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,810
for the locals to organise but they

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,450
still always need help to actually make

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,150
the practicalities work and again just

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,589
someone who's willing to equally in the

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,690
period leading up to the conference is

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,020
good to have someone who's interested in

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:49,089
those topics men can make suggestions do

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,089
research check prices whatever is needed

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,470
then a lot of the other areas of debconf

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:57,110
organization you don't even need to have

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,180
any particular there doesn't need to be

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,290
any particular local work done but it's

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,210
something that needs to happen and again

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,830
these are the kind of things where it

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,779
really is a big help if we can get

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,180
people who want to help in these areas

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,700
and push them again to relieve the

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,240
pressure from the local organizers a bit

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,130
so one of the biggest areas there again

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,140
I don't know if anyone in this here has

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,630
who's not already helping with it has

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,460
experienced in the area but you may have

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,330
noticed that DEFCON doesn't have a

00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,890
compulsory registration fee that we pay

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,110
for food and accommodation for a lot of

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,120
participants that we pay travel for some

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,440
number of participants and obviously to

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,730
make that possible we needs to a lot of

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,350
fundraising again in debian in general

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,970
most people are not experts in

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,440
fundraising a lot of people find it

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,959
something that's kind of scary or

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,300
doesn't sound at all interesting to do

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,830
because it's basically hassling people

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,110
about giving you money which is not

00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,270
really the what is a productive thing to

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,900
do but not the most relaxing way to

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:59,420
spend your time but again we we're all

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,820
we're we're short on people to help in

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,959
that area and I'm sure there I don't

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,279
know I don't know about people in this

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,750
room that I'm sure maybe you know

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,000
someone else in Debian or someone else

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,440
at DEFCON who you think would have an

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,910
aptitude for that and could help out

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,860
there again Treasury accounting some we

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,089
have some some people who do a little

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,020
bit but we can all wait we could do with

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:26,060
a lot more help so I think more people

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:27,650
more hands would be useful again in

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,930
another area and most most people in

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:34,430
DEFCON are not at all expert on dealing

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:36,810
with media things we could do with if

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,270
the if you or no if you are a havoc

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,550
doing things with media or as in dealing

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,230
with press or if you know someone else

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,670
who is even if they're not really

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,890
involved with Debian at the moment then

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:51,060
maybe that's a good way to get them to

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:53,220
make a contribution because again it's

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,080
it's not well it's not strictly vital

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,839
it's really a good thing if we can have

00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,279
some local coverage or some kind of

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,870
international coverage to show that

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,610
Debbie and is having a conference and is

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:07,110
doing useful things maybe a few again

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,030
there are more technical ways again to

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:14,640
help remotely things like helping design

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:16,380
websites helping with in admin is an

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,560
infrastructure for various servers that

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,170
we have I think I mentioned video team

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,650
already at one task that will be coming

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,510
up imminently and is again not a is

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,090
something that often gets left behind a

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,610
bit is the production of a final report

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,640
for the conference basically that's just

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,370
a collection of articles about different

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,429
aspects of the conference plus some kind

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,310
of budget information other more

00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,600
numerical stuff about what's happened so

00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,490
again we're always looking for people

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,960
who can volunteer to write one or two

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:54,990
articles there maybe on just just once

00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:03,990
to say something well it's fine if we

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:06,090
have to make fun about the final report

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,440
there isn't really like there are a

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,720
couple of articles that have to be

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,810
written but what is also incredibly

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,730
usefulness if you feel super happy about

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,350
a day and you just want to write you

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,720
know a paragraph or three sentences

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,540
about what you experienced on that day

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,550
and how it really helped you contribute

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,100
to Debian or whether you forged

00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,230
friendships and whatever write that and

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,760
send it to us or commit it directly I

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,560
mean maybe it's not gonna end up in the

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,120
final report maybe it's gonna end up in

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,890
another final report in the future years

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
a quote or in their sponsorship brochure

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:40,020
but materials like this coming from

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,730
attendees is very very helpful and then

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,100
applies to photos as well which I guess

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,250
is taken care of but some people also

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,920
are doing photos and sometimes they

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:52,610
shots that are too good to pass up the

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,350
opportunity something then coming again

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,970
coming just down the list there's a lot

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,210
of job different jobs to do with talks

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,070
in the conference in practical terms I

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,660
don't know exactly I don't actually know

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,490
how it's being coordinated this year I

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:09,140
didn't if Martinez or someone else about

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:10,250
the kind of talk master stuff a we is do

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:22,060
you know what does anyone know if what's

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:25,310
happening video team so over the last

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:28,990
few days we've been short quite

00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:31,760
dramatically of people on video team

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:34,400
ideally there wants to be somebody to

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,250
look after each talk let somebody know

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,020
at the start how long they've got want

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,010
people when they've got ten minutes five

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:45,590
minutes to go introduce the talks this

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,750
year video team seem to be doing that to

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,070
an extent so please let yourself be

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,250
known if you know if you just sitting in

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,870
a conference and you can spend five

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,180
minutes in a room with us starting at

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,120
the end of the talk volunteer just for

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,630
that talk we could always do with the

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,690
help yeah dog she wanted to go to

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,920
anyways yeah the two guys are cameras

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,060
literally didn't know the wrong cameras

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,340
until they walked into the room and just

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:14,150
said I can help them yeah

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,290
so well thank you then at a wider level

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,570
of talk stuff

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,060
there's even during the conference

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,090
period there's a need for kind of people

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,510
who are checking about talk scheduling

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:28,460
which can means scheduling new events

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,110
but it also includes again is it's very

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,730
useful if someone actually checks

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,800
whether the people who are speakers have

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,780
genuinely turned up to the conference

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,690
and whether they are awake that

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,070
particular day for example we have at

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,710
some problems before or why we had to

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,300
try and drag speakers out of bed 10

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:50,150
minutes after that talk started which is

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:51,770
not really ideal and again in the cut in

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,510
the period leading up to the conference

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,700
more than just now but it's something

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,140
you could volunteer for now and be

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,990
involved with in future years there's

00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,760
the need for

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,159
whoo look at the talk submissions we've

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,130
got and do the kind of filtering and

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,110
scheduling of the main program to say

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,190
what do we actually want to include in

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,600
the schedule for the next year's

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:14,279
conference and also there's a space to

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,230
go out and actively encourage a few

00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,789
people where where it seems some there's

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,200
maybe there's a topics that seems to be

00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:20,580
particularly relevant in Debian at the

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,529
time and we can actually go out and

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,750
reach out to someone to try and persuade

00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:26,760
them to give a talk on that it or again

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,279
to get people who are high profile

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,490
within Debian in particular key roles to

00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,470
actively encourage them to agree some

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,720
kind of talk idea that would be good for

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:42,779
everyone to have the time to hit listen

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:45,000
to and to discuss again again in terms

00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:46,529
of filtering or ranking and so on

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,299
there's the need for people who would

00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:54,960
volunteer to help with allocating who

00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,490
actually is eligible for the different

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,279
kinds of sponsorship and bursaries we

00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,809
give obviously for that is good if

00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,250
you've been maybe if you've been

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,679
involved in Debian a few years already

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,260
so that you have some idea who people

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,149
are just mean a lot of the information

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,520
you should have to get by just searching

00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:12,990
for people but I visit a lot quicker to

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,390
do it if you have some idea who they are

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,700
and does what they're saying about their

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:21,899
plans for dev conference would make

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:24,960
sense again it's it's it's something

00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:26,220
that actually has some kind of power or

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,890
influence but it's not something that's

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,620
necessarily attractive to everyone to to

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,440
spend the time to do but clearly these

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,340
are all jobs that we really need some

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,000
they need to happen to make the

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,679
conference work well again during the

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,850
both in advance of the conference and

00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,059
during the conference again we need

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,980
people who will do things like allocate

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,690
the rooms in the accommodation and again

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,760
make sure who hasn't actually turned up

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,289
should we is there some problem that

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,600
means we need to move people around this

00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:57,059
kind of thing again often we'll get a

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,549
few some attendees who need to cancel at

00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,340
the last moment and other people who

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:03,840
turn up with three extra family members

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,399
they hadn't expected to bring and we

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,539
suddenly we need to find some solution

00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,700
of how this how all these things work

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,950
each of these each of these roles

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,139
doesn't necessarily need to be

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,299
I'm consuming but it does become too

00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:15,740
much if you have one a couple of people

00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:19,159
trying to do too many of these things at

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,990
once so for many of these jobs the best

00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,970
as if there's really one person who can

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,799
just take take a particular role and

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,870
just be the be the known contact for

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,510
attendees for that area

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:31,070
and just can't just again enjoy the

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,169
conference as normal but when there's an

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,730
issue in that particular topic they can

00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:37,429
deal with it calmly because they're not

00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:42,500
already being busy with twenty other

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:44,090
jobs as well and again on technical

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,600
things we would we could do with more

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:50,570
people to help with the administration

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,289
of various the websites and so on to do

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:56,779
with Def Con and also for things to do

00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:58,490
with the DEF CON email lists in fact for

00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:00,019
quite a lot of stuff to do with the

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,110
websites and email lists there's been a

00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:05,240
an agreed agreement since a couple of

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,880
years ago that we would do a migration

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,250
of these from the current depth

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,889
comfortable infrastructure on to more

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,470
standard Debian infrastructure but again

00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:18,370
we need some people to actually take

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,539
that and do the work there which is

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,860
again it's obviously easier if it's

00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:23,299
people it's easier in a way if it's

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,919
people who are already familiar with the

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,710
relevant infrastructure but it can also

00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,799
be a way for someone new to the project

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,360
to get familiar with the infrastructure

00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:34,010
generally and dellynne debconf as in the

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,799
rest of debian if you take any of these

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:38,960
kind of jobs of course it's you you meet

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,330
the other people you can learn how

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,970
things work in the area learn some

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:48,289
technical things get some just normally

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,240
people find them that if they start

00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:53,570
doing one thing is easy to expand it to

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,980
doing others later i don't know again

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,389
some of the people here who are new

00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,769
faces maybe hits they're still looking

00:24:56,389 --> 00:25:01,730
for something to do with in debian in

00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:03,799
general I'm not sure I I don't really

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,240
want to say a lot more for myself that I

00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,720
don't as some people have other points

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,720
or questions

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,650
I'm well I was just gonna add a little

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,820
bit to what you just said and

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:22,050
specifically in regards of the future I

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,780
mean we're at this conference right now

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,030
and it's as you said people are who are

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,350
already helping are probably like to

00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,050
stress to actually be able to manage

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,530
volunteers so that is an important

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:37,770
aspect to keep in mind and that goes

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:40,080
very well with the with the spirit of

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,210
the conference itself which we like to

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,340
call an unconference every now and then

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,260
so it's really your conference if you

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,230
want to do something just do it and

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,240
generally that works until somebody of

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,010
slaps you because you've got something

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,540
wrong but you know that you have to do a

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,460
lot of things wrong before that happens

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,020
so if you want to organize an event do

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,270
it if you want if you see someone

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,010
carrying stuff help you know that that's

00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,200
the sort of way to get involved but in

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,380
terms of the future

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,120
we already know that there is TC 15

00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,190
happening in Germany next year and if

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,530
you are interested in getting involved

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,060
then pop onto our Channel

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,890
onto our mailing list and just you know

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,420
just idle have a look maybe there's

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,660
something you can pick up and then

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:24,210
beyond TC 15 there is TC 16 and TC 17

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,010
and well one of the greatest waste I

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,020
have to say to get involved in Def Con

00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:31,230
is to become a volunteer by organizing a

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,930
conference from the radar dancer if you

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,820

in my town and find a venue and so on I

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,750
think you can I think you can do it it's

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,400
a lot of work but if you started early

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,860
and and you're committed to it then you

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,470
can do it and I'm at least for my part I

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,140
