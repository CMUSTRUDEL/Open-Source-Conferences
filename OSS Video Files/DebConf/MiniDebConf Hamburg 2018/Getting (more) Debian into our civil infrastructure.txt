welcome back the next talk will be very

00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,000
young kinesio

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,139
fisca kishka kids go Kiska on getting

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,230
more debian into our civil

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,720
infrastructure yeah thank you Mike oh

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,490
yeah so my name is Yann Kiska you may

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,440
not know me I'm not Debian developer not

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:27,510
Devi maintainer I'm just an upstream

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:30,000
hecka I'm looking for Siemens and part

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,969
of a Linux team there for now 10 years

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,120
actually more than 10 years we are

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,789
supporting our business units in getting

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,999
Linux into the products successfully for

00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,829
that long time even long actually and

00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:46,140
today I'm representing a collaborative

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,350
project that has some relationship with

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,719
Debian and even more soon I'm treasurer

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,940
so first of all maybe surprise to some

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,579
of you and our civilization is heavily

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,059
running on Linux and you may not think

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,129
about these kind of devices where some

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,800
kind of Linux inside or you may think of

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,340
all the cloud servers running Linux

00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:16,259
inside but actually this is about

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:20,969
devices more closer to us in all of our

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,189
infrastructure there are control systems

00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:26,789
there are management systems included

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,820
and and many many many of them run Linux

00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:33,630
inside so maybe if you are traveling

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,329
with a Deutsche Bahn to this event these

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,820
days there was some Linux system on the

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,479
train as well as they were on the

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,450
wayside so on the control side any

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,020
generation so power plants they are also

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,789
run with Linux in very interesting ways

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,950
and positive ways industry automation so

00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:58,530
the factories they have control systems

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,200
inside and quite a few are running Linux

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,439
inside and also other systems like

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,560
health care diagnostic systems so these

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,030
big bows up there the magnetic resonance

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,640
imaging systems they are running or

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,640
Linux for over a decade now building

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,520
automation so not at home but in the

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,819
professional building area

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,830
so actually as I said the train systems

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,280
they are going to be even more on Debian

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,560
soon

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,000
we have Debian for quite a while and

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,930
power generations will be in this case

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Siemens we have the box underneath on

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,760
the third row and industrial switch

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,290
there is running Debian and the

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,140
healthcare device is still on the bun

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,560
too but soon be Debian as well just to

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,420
give some examples and yeah these are

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,030
the areas where we as a group and we

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:53,750
assume interactive but there are some

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:56,010
problems with this just take an example

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,380
former railway systems usually these

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:04,860
kind of devices installations they have

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:06,360
a lifetime of well 25 50 years well it

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,250
used to be quite simple with these old

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,970
devices simple in the sense that it was

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,489
mechanic

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,049
it was pretty robust and you can I was

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,790
once told at one of these locking

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,459
systems they were basically left in the

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,890
booth in a box out there for 50 years

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,310
and no one entered the boss no one

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,930
touched the whole thing for 50 years

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,299
these times a little bit over nowadays

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,209
we have more electronic systems in these

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,540
systems and they contain of course

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,190
software and what does it mean does it

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,260
give you an idea how these kind of

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,329
development looks like in this domain so

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,790
it starts that well development takes

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,340
quite a long time until the product is

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,010
ready three to five years

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,930
then in the railway domain it's mostly

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,609
about customizing the systems for

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,070
specific installations of the railway

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,829
systems not only in Europe they are kind

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,510
of messy regarding the differences so

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,269
you have specific requirements of the

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,829
customer means the railway operators to

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,519
adjust these systems for their needs

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:08,250
and you see by then after five years

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,769
already a debian version would be a lot

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,859
of maintenance and if you add another

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,900
years well you can start over again so

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,780
in the development time you may change

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,519
to the system but later on it's getting

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,109
hard to change the system for the

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,639
medically because then the interesting

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,870
part starts in this domain not only in

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,870
this domain that's safety and security

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,230
assessment and and approval for these

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,790
systems and it also takes time and so

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,250
for example in Germany you go for the

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,750
eysan bond buddhism and you ask to get

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,940
the permission to run that train on the

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,450
track and if they say ohm I'm not happy

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,850
with it

00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,800
you do it over again and it takes time

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,960
and if you change something in the

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,150
system it becomes interesting because

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,880
then some of these certification aspects

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,400
become invalid you have to redo it and

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,260
then of course these trains on the

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,030
installations they have a long lifetime

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,680
as I mentioned before so how do you deal

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,570
with this in electronic devices and

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,360
software driven devices over this long

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,400
face that's all a challenge and it's

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,380
just one example and they're more in

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:16,880
this area at the same time what we see

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:20,000
now is these fancy buzzwords from cloud

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,260
business entering our conservative

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,810
slowly moving domain and we talk about

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,210
IOT industrial IOT so connect the

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,180
devices we talk about edge computing

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,280
means getting the power of the cloud to

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,280
the device in the field closer to where

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,260
the real thing happened so networking

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,030
becomes a topic so in the past you

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,090
basically build a system you locked it

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,470
up physically you never touch it again

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,720
except the customer complained that

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,540
there was some back inside these days

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,100
the customer asked us to do a frequent

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,750
update and actually on the customers

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,580
also the regulatory bodies asked for

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,530
this so you have to have some security

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,880
maintenance concept in this which means

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:03,530
regular updates regular fixes and and

00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,870
that is of course challenging for these

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:10,450
kind of Dwain where you have a slow

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,450
running and long-running support cycles

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,760
so to summarize there is a very long

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,520
time we have to maintain our devices in

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,350
the field and so far this was mostly

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,900
done individually so each company and

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,090
sometimes not that sometimes quite

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,050
frequently also inside the company each

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:32,180
product group development corner did it

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,650
individually so everyone has having its

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,110
own kernel everyone is having its own

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,120
base system it was easy to build up so

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,730
it should be easy to maintain of course

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,680
it's not yeah so this was one thing well

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,639
this is one important thing and then of

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,379
course we

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,060
not always are completely happy with

00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,069
that the free-software gives us there

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,719
are some needs swab to make things more

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:54,139
robust to make things more secure and

00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:56,539
reliable so we have to work with these

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,210
components and and improve them mostly

00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,469
upstream and that of course is another

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,229
challenge we have to address in this

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:05,569
area and catch up with a trend that

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,490
coming in from the server space on the

00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:11,539
cloud space

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:13,849
so with these challenge and oops it was

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:18,069
the point where were we in this case a

00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:20,990
number of big users of industrial

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:23,240
open-source systems came together and

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,539
created a new collaborative project as

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,460
you do in the open source area and this

00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:32,750
project is called civil infrastructure

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,539
platform it's among the or it's under

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,159
the umbrella of the Linux Foundation so

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,750
there are many project MINIX foundation

00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,840
you may have seen but most of them are

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,719
more in the area of cloud computing or

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,909
in the area of maybe automotive

00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:48,440
computing this one actually is even more

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:51,139
conservative than the other ones and

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,650
it's it's also compared with small and

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,509
our goal is to build this yeah this

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,289
open-source base layer for these

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:04,699
application scenarios based on free

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:07,729
software based on on Linux we started no

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,740
two years ago and that's basically our

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,750
structures give you an idea so member

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,020
companies so the the three on the top

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,860
are the founding platinum companies

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,710
Hitachi Toshiba and Siemens we have code

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,029
sink and a plat home on board we had n1

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,979
board from the first time as well and

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,770
where as I joined us and just recently

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:29,750
also moxa so if you compare this with

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,909
other corporation kauravs product it's

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,130
pretty small one apparently small ones

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:36,829
our budget is also limited it's still

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,680
it's decent enough but well we are

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:43,089
growing and based on this budget we have

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,040
some developers being paid so part of

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:50,660
pen is paid this way we will see later

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,370
on why and we have people working from

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,920
the companies in the communities and we

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,250
are ramping up on on working with

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,230
communities yeah

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:03,000
to improve the base layers for our needs

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,430
everything is open sauce we have a

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,110
Gibbler paper as well and you can look

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:12,170
up there what's going on there so the

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,010
main areas activities where we are

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:20,400
working on right now so four areas

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:23,220
current maintenance so we started with

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,700
declaring one kernel as the CIP kernel

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,160
to have an extended support phase for

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,860
this kernel of of ten years so this is

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,440
what we are aiming for which is feasible

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,300
already for some enterprise distros in a

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,130
specific area but here we are talking

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,670
about an industrial area in a bedded

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,870
area so there is some some challenge

00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,760
well I'm saying ten years there

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,620
sometimes within fifteen years we will

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,560
see after ten years if we prolong to

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,990
this along with this of course comes the

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,120
need for for real-time support so we are

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,290
also currently it's a separate branch

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,260
but it's going to be indicated

00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,540
eventually have Prem that he branch

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,760
colleague of mine is doing this and as I

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,630
mentioned before Ben is currently our

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,790
forward for CIP kernel maintainer so

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,430
yeah this is the core basically where we

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,770
started activities we continued in

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,190
extending this on test infrastructure so

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,720
we invest it a bit in improving on

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,890
labyrinth first structure we are now

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,810
ramping up in internal lava lab just to

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,210
enable the kernel testing of course and

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,790
then that's actually what I am going to

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,280
talk about today it'd be more there's a

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,750
CIP core so the color alone doesn't make

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,150
the systems you need a user space and

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,089
you need a user land and that's

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,060
basically where we are now focusing on

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:45,240
or in our ramping up our activities is

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,400
to define this CIP core means a base

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,500
system user space based system which we

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:55,980
wanted to maintain as long as the kernel

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:58,440
so another 10 years thing so and our

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,740
group had a couple of members which were

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,990
already familiar was there been before

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,080
and so it was pretty easy for that group

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,870
to decide on choosing Debian as the base

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,960
as a base sauce for our core

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,450
a CRP core package package set so why

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,060
was it being Shuzhen well it has an

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,920
outstanding maturity and and focus on

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,420
stability so you are pretty much aligned

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,790
regarding how conservative we see

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,370
certain things which is a positive thing

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,670
for us and it has very professional

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:32,070
security properties but we also rely on

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,250
heavily and also another interesting

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,670
aspect for us is a license hygiene that

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,440
you are after to ensure that there is

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:43,830
yea only free software in these packages

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,570
and that is properly documented we when

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,420
we are using and redistributing software

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,620
but in contrast to for example the the

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,839
server space where you don't usually

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,550
redistribute things we are

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,110
redistributing devices so we re

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,850
distributing software we have to take

00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,010
care of the licenses that we re

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,310
distributing and that we are compliant

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,810
with all these licenses included so it's

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,730
very important for us that this is a

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,310
consistent picture we get from the

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,600
package someone took a look at this

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,520
already and we are still looking

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,250
ourselves on this but that's a very

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,760
important thing so with these characters

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,440
we chose Debian as the base system so

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,300
what does it mean right now we are

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,950
currently and the processor said to

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,070
select the core packages from Debian

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,620
packages there is to be some little bit

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,810
of stripped down obviously so we are

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,360
already working with Debian on certain

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,770
long-term support aspects just to

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
mention two activities so we were

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,120
sponsoring already the staging repo for

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
security master actually I'm personally

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,200
aware of the current city of this

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,330
project but we've got the feedback that

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,330
is apparently a valuable thing for LTS

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,450
activity we just joined LTS project

00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,700
Platinum sponsoring and we are now

00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,550
involved in the discussion too for this

00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,000
extended LTS activities so anything

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,860
beyond five years and well in the end

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,320
that's what we committed to our users

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,779
and we want to ensure that for the basis

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,900
then the ten years is reached of course

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,270
ideally in the community not only based

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,330
on our or personal activities but in the

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:19,130
end we have to fill the gap and that's

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,130
basically our commitment on this

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,329
don't take this literally what is

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,399
written here so this is basically to

00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:30,449
reflect the the package set we are

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,670
discussing and there are well there's

00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:35,639
some 30 to 300 packages on a discussion

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,319
so to say right now which is we are

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,660
condensing basically the input from our

00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:41,040
users from our members what they are

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,629
using already and there's a difference

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,579
we will see later on where these comes

00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,350
from in the amount of packages in the

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,199
way they are using so the kernel

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,999
currently is not part of the Debian

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,589
thing we import although some of our

00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:55,559
users will directly use the Debian

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,019
kernel but as I said when there is a

00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,239
need for additional activities that's

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,769
what I see a peak owner comes in and

00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,869
then we have a set of base packages and

00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:05,519
then of course we also have to have a

00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:08,879
certain set of packages that we need to

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,220
keep in a usable way to ensure the

00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,439
reproducibility of this base set because

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,269
if we want to fix something after nine

00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:17,249
years in the field on the basis then

00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,869
produced the past we have to ensure if

00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:25,079
you can come up with the same result

00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:28,739
plus the Delta so there are different

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,899
ways how to build a system and compared

00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:32,129
to the classic installation you may know

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,889
from a desktop on a server you're not

00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:37,139
installing we are pre building images

00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:39,209
and then deploy these images on the

00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,970
device rather than the factory or out in

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,889
the field so the challenge for us is if

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,769
we have this package list how to get to

00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,449
the to the device image so just to give

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:52,169
you a brief idea so of course there is

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:55,739
some input from the CRP kernel in songs

00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:58,319
from and then we are using predominantly

00:14:55,739 --> 00:15:01,230
pre-built binary packages from Debian

00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:04,110
and or source packages off the sauce

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,269
feet from Debian so the the Debian sauce

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,039
the upstream sauce plus the Debian

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:11,129
patches as input feet and that comes

00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,019
down to a minimum base system to be

00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:18,480
generated and we are currently working

00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:21,059
on this there is no defined way of

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,549
producing this image with ncip at this

00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:26,779
point we are basically following two

00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:29,369
paths one of them is the path which is

00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:32,100
dominated by the idea okay we have to

00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:33,510
ensure we in this case the corporate

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,640
environments have to ensure to

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:39,360
produced image ourself the binaries

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:42,030
ourself so we take the maintained

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,400
sources from a Debian community but we

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,860
rebuilt and then generate a new binary

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,990
so to say out of these that's one way

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,080
and that's an activity which if you

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,450
heard about it made a debian project

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:58,860
prominently predominantly driven by

00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:01,800
Toshiba which uses the Yocto like bit

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,570
back like way of producing a base system

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,230
but out of Debian sources so that you

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:11,130
have a maintained source input feed for

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:15,480
this production that's one path the

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:17,970
other path is using predominantly binary

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,950
packages and personally in specific user

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,770
daemons we are more following this path

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,550
here so that is for example the ease our

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,880
project

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:30,390
Bojan is one of the developers here as

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,260
well we are working on this path means

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:37,260
that 95 or 99 percent of your image

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,660
consists originally of binaries Debian

00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,240
binaries as they are shipped as they are

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,490
released and then there is often the

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,560
need to modify a little bit maybe the

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,750
kernel maybe the bootloader may be a

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,080
special patched package for whatever

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:54,420
reason hopefully good once you have an

00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,310
infrastructure to to assemble the binary

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,340
images and to produce the source

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,290
packages on demand and install that into

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,750
an image that you then can flash on the

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,630
device that's the second path we are

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,400
following as I said that's just to

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,380
describe the workflows and the

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,140
technology behind it is not yet

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,209
standardized in the CIP for us at

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,770
Siemens currently the main strategy as I

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:19,980
said is the easier path so it's also

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,500
bitbake based job - like production but

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:27,140
based on the Debian binaries producing

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,140
ready to install the device image

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:37,460
so if we look at the situation so what

00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:40,610
is Debian providing well a large set of

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,450
packages a nice level of support three

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,769
plus two years LTS mostly that's already

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,419
great I mean there's everything

00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:49,460
available almost everything in the world

00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:55,940
with full free software we can get me a

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:58,429
Debian the built well it support native

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,549
built that's also advantage because

00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:03,139
while fighting after 10 years 15 years

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,840
with cross pillow there's always the

00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:08,029
problem with cross building even a

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,389
little bit so this is a good strategy to

00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:13,250
go to go although you're also working on

00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:14,950
cross builds that may be interesting for

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,120
certain scenarios as well for us and

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,710
we're all discussing this these days

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,409
reproducible build is also very

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,690
important for us because we also have to

00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:25,820
prove that the Delta is really only on

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,379
the Delta that has to be changed and not

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,090
anything else and we have to rebuild

00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:30,799
something for whatever reason we don't

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,200
want to produce a completely different

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,669
image in the end so it's a very

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,919
important topic I mentioned already

00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:40,580
before the license compliance topics um

00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:42,080
I'm not really the the deep expert in

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,000
all the licensing thing except when I

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,190
have to be because some customer asked

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,419
us internally how to be compliant and

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,049
how to solve certain compliance findings

00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,970
colleague of mine

00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:55,399
McCrea for example who's maintaining the

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:58,009
force ology project is way more in this

00:18:55,399 --> 00:19:00,919
because we have our also infrastructure

00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:03,799
to ensure license compliance and

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,679
identify packages package ideas and the

00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,679
idea as far as I heard is that to

00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,480
combine these kind of activities so that

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,940
Debian can also use the information that

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,059
these kind of scanners produce like SP

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,419
dekes formats and and built it into the

00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,580
Debian 5 next-generation and and in turn

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:24,350
we can extract these information and

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,240
ensure that they are still valid when we

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,720
when we take a package so there's a lot

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,210
of activity already great in this area

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,309
and of course testing not to mention so

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,350
what we need to require here as I said

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:39,139
one thing is what we need longer support

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:43,490
phase the number of packages fortunately

00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:44,090
is then much lower so yeah as I said so

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,390
something

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,429
a couple of hundreds at most is what we

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,029
are currently heading for for most of

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:55,159
our devices we have the need to both

00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,320
build natively and cross cross

00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,659
predominantly and the development phase

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,820
but there might be also cases where it

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,380
might be useful for production image but

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,940
predominantly it's for development phase

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,919
you want to quick turnaround time when

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,730
you're building on XD six forearm for

00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:13,580
example yeah the binary source packages

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:17,380
should be managed and reproducible the

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,669
last compliance already mentioned and

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,440
yeah the testing activity is also

00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:23,450
something that we want to improve on

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,730
further so where we see the

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,210
collaboration yeah already mentioned

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,190
longer term maintenance for packages

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,360
that's definitely an area where we we

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,409
are reaching out and we are in

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,429
discussion contributing to Debian cross

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:41,750
there's activities going on this area

00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:44,120
reproducible we had some discussion hug

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,279
and and Chris these days where we could

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,590
possibly support you on this it's not

00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,200
our topmost priority at this point but

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:54,740
it's obviously it will become in the

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,240
future and also a way possibly

00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,159
interesting for you I think there is a

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,549
good chance that these activities also

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,799
open up more adoption in the bedded

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,419
space of Debian so because we also

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,039
discussing these kind of things with our

00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,409
suppliers means the silicon vendors

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,270
pushing them to be more upstream in

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,970
order to have it easier for us to

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,909
integrate their work in our systems and

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,890
eventually also enabling them to well

00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:21,110
use the same magnetic mechanism that we

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:25,340
are using for building our images to

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:27,559
build their our customer SDKs or however

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,080
they call them and that can create a

00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,580
large ecosystem and we have discussing

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,590
already with some of these vendors and

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,740
someone actually are interested in in

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:40,159
Debian as well as as a default image to

00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,510
replace those not so successful sauce

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,799
built approaches that are out there in

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,679
the field

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,940
eventually with something more easy to

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,789
use the another area I really like to

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,159
see that we have collaboration on is the

00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,450
regarding the license results so we at

00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,650
seam is currently running through with

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,550
these subs

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,320
package set to a force ology run and I

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,059
would like to see the result of this run

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,860
comparing it to what Debian is currently

00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:09,290
reporting in the metadata if there's any

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,800
gaps anything that our experts say okay

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,050
you should document it more that way or

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,670
there is something missing and of course

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,610
report these issues upstream because

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:21,290
eventually I don't want to rescan every

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,980
single security update package

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:26,960
internally again if you did already that

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,030
should just run through and we should

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,309
have the trust that these information is

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:34,429
accurate and and we can rely on them

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,220
that's the vision behind it and yeah

00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:40,929
test cases would be also an area where

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,220
we see a chance to contribute something

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,900
further things we are discussing might

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,400
be not that interesting for Debian but

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,260
it's interesting in general functional

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,910
safety activities you'll be surprised so

00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,220
many people ask me for functional safe

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,720
Linux these days may it be for

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,410
automotive but also for industrial

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,780
purposes worth mentioning actually is

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,040
the secured standard this way so even if

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,840
you're not involved in all this ICT

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,570
whatever stuff it's interesting because

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,790
this is pushing us in industry to do

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:10,610
things like update strategies even more

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:12,860
system consistently and ensuring that

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,620
the image that we ship is Integra so

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,840
that is really the original image um up

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,150
to the questions how to secure the boot

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,270
and and how to secure the system is

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,370
running so that helps us to argue

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,250
internally and externally for

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,020
consolidation and that helps us

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,210
currently to push a lot of these users

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,179
and towards the Debian solution so one

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,700
of our units did wants a survey recently

00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:40,670
actually about how many Linux systems

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:44,330
they have out there and they counted 99

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,770
balloons and Linux systems actually and

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,900
of course you can imagine it's pretty

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,420
hard to maintain 99 variants in the

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,970
field out there so they are one of the

00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,220
most prominent drivers inside our

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,020
company to consolidate the systems and

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,670
we are currently consolidating over

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,429
Debian not everything but most of it

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:06,679
yeah and then there is this doomsday

00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:08,540
date as well which is praising and

00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,520
creating an increasing concern because

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,149
you can imagine that if you are building

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,059
a device

00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:15,440
today maybe it's out of business in ten

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,809
years okay you are lucky maybe it's

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,159
still running in twenty years and is not

00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:21,739
yet ready for twenty thirty eight and

00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:24,259
then we have a problem so that's things

00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:25,609
in butts going on currently already so

00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:28,460
one of our units for example is

00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:31,279
sponsoring activities in GFC to prove

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,839
the topic and as a consortium it's a CIP

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,639
group we are also looking into this we

00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:36,200
would not jump in on things which are

00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:39,259
already been happening but if there are

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:46,639
gaps up there then we will possibly jump

00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:48,649
in here as well so to summarize we

00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:50,509
believe I personally as well is very

00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:52,940
strong that our infrastructure Student

00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:56,599
Success it's way too critical to run our

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:59,179
tre software it which is happening not

00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:02,989
everywhere fortunately and we can

00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:05,719
improve on this together because there's

00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:07,279
a strong interest in our group to enable

00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:11,509
and preserve an open-source base layer

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,549
for this environment we choose Debian as

00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:16,219
a solid foundation because we believe

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:18,229
that it is technically a good solution

00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:19,820
and it's also a good solution because

00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:21,649
it's a community approach that we are

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,979
also following we see that we don't

00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:28,399
differentiate over these base layer we

00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:29,899
differentiate between our competitors on

00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:32,330
the higher functionality on the

00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,950
integration but not what is in details

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,839
running underneath and this is a very

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,899
great point to occur operate and to work

00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,599
together and see appears we're looking

00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:44,629
forward to deepness support off and the

00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,619
collaboration with Debian community so

00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:50,179
if you have any ideas or if you have any

00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:51,979
suggestions how we should approach

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:54,469
certain things what we should also think

00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:56,989
about feel free to approach me to for

00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:59,450
you to approach the community there are

00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:02,509
some resources I think I put it

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:06,169
somewhere here no it's gone

00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:08,269
and wordly there's marinus we have it's

00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:10,489
currently dominated by by kernel patch

00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:11,929
reviews the back paws that we are doing

00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:13,519
for the fork fork owner but they are

00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:15,499
also other times being discussed so this

00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,549
is one of the channels we have our get

00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:21,019
labs yeah and we are persons around

00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:22,759
meeting us maybe once in a while on some

00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,530
conference or whatever feel free to

00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,900
approach us and talk to us would be

00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,010
very much appreciated and with this no

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:37,970
thank you

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:40,900
and I'm taking questions thanks Ann for

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,900
the talk other questions

00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:50,750
one one question you said you have like

00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:54,740
100 riff and Linux variations do you

00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:57,740
plan to replace them with Debian or is

00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,680
is the plan only for the new devices you

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,600
you chip to use Debian so unless you are

00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,430
really forced to for whatever reason you

00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,870
usually do not replace since something

00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,900
which has been deployed to the field

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:11,450
that usually causes more turn than to

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,510
keep with it and and right in the dust

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,430
and try to prolong the support and so

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,120
this is more about the new things coming

00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:21,380
up it's a step moving forward so

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,810
currently we're discussing maybe a

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,660
handful of in this specific domain where

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,490
this 99 variants come from a handful of

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:31,790
applications ranging from virtual

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,230
machine images on embedded servers to

00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,610
the embedded servers themselves and the

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:39,290
smallest thing I currently am working on

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:41,720
is a is a box for being a data diode so

00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,730
it's a device which ensures that the

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,560
critical network is not infiltrated from

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,910
the outside physically but it's still

00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,010
enable certain kind of logging

00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,570
functionality for things so these are

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,830
the range of the account dealing within

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,120
that domain only and there's more coming

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,880
including hopefully at least for our

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,830
company even for some of our platforms

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,570
which are open platforms means you get a

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,790
hardware and you get a software stack on

00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:07,600
top which might be Windows or might be

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:10,930
Linux and and that Linux might be Debian

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,930
most woman

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:19,620
thank you for this really insightful

00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:22,200
talk I'm totally excited about such big

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,450
companies putting some pressure behind

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,940
Linux and Debian and the free software

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,440
in general in industrial applications

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,600
and I remember my heart jumping when I

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,790
saw a Debian spill too two weeks ago on

00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,140
one of those info displays in the s-bahn

00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:39,680
bringing you home from work actually

00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:44,850
even if that device was malfunctioning

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:47,760
it was displaying a Debian spool and my

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:51,270
question is what is your vision about

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,480
the SSL situation in in this very

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:57,360
long-term maintenance I mean we still

00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,810
have the vast majority of software using

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,180
optimises l with its problematic license

00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:06,060
and we have a gazillion of alternatives

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,880
where are things going on the SS outside

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,440
of industrial applications that's a very

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,260
good question I don't have a definite

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,990
answer to this as well so currently

00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,930
there is quite a bit of open SSL being

00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:21,080
deployed it's not really new it has been

00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:24,000
happened I think for ten years already

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,360
and that's a state of the art so to say

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,250
with all the pros and cons involved we

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,020
are a little bit involved in working

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,290
certain certain features in upstream but

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:37,530
in the end it's a question if I have to

00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:40,050
see hopefully these libraries become

00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,960
more compatible so eventually you may be

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,780
able to even replace certain aspects of

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,700
them in the field but if all goes wrong

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:51,060
we really have to invest also in the

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,880
maintenance of these things so well

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,440
we are currently also facing this with

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,810
the distribution so hopefully the

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,340
distributions will work on this as well

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,370
and where there is neat we can

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,630
collaborate on it technically I would

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:08,010
say it would be great to have something

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:10,800
clean shiny and targeted but then again

00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:14,940
it's a pretty hard challenge to solve

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,830
this and to work on this so I don't

00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,020
think that the major push will come from

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,530
industry at this point our domain is

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,840
still rather small compared to others

00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,770
but if we can individually support

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,200
something without

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,180
- initiative F never have to initiative

00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,980
for to write a call thing or goes a

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,020
different way that would be great yeah

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:40,440
so that I don't have a different bounds

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:45,330
on this right now so my questions are a

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:47,670
little bit of licensing GP re is mostly

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:51,170
a concern in the industry what is the

00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:54,330
policy or how is CRP handling this

00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:57,300
special license so we don't have a

00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:00,870
definitive license exclusion list except

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,970
it has to be free software we have a

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:06,090
preferred license for own activities

00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:08,370
actually which is permissive license but

00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,650
we also do GPL licensing in our group

00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,240
but then the question is what do we

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,190
include in our package set which is

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,100
already there so just these days I had

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,260
two discussion with an internal user who

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,050
came around with aha these gplv3 this

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,330
evil stuff and I said because in the

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,640
context of we want to ensure that our

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,820
device is video original so we have to

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,270
walk down we have to encrypt it and we

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,910
have to do Siskiyou boot saying okay yes

00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:38,250
the license says explicitly that there

00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,050
is the need to unencrypted the device

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,700
and that has of course complications

00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,590
when you think about the liability at

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,120
behalf for our devices so we run through

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,790
all the certification processes and we

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,000
stand for that and if now the someone

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:54,120
changes this and how can we prove that

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,800
it has been changed and so they were

00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,380
very concerned about gplv3

00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,420
and and I said okay it might be more

00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,690
explicit in that license but gplv2 has

00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,430
the same idea and you are at least in

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,130
the in a gray area as well in business

00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:10,500
license if you think about locking

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:13,020
things down fortunately there are

00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,360
patterns if they will work is something

00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,520
we have to see and that you can enable

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,520
an end customer to replace the software

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,560
be compliant with the license but of

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,930
course then avoid your Verity of

00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,270
warranty on the device and on all these

00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:29,030
yeah legal obligation that people film

00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,410
this hopefully this pattern it will book

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,890
if it doesn't work but we are not alone

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:36,750
with this problem by far but we are very

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,000
accurate with this that can be sure so

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:41,700
if we do this we do it accurately

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,920
the concern I hear often is also with

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:49,440
functional safety in that concert yeah

00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:52,700
so yeah how to handle that so I'm not a

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,320
lawyer so I can answer this definitely

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,540
but I think the discussion I had a

00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,710
couple of days ago triggered some ideas

00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,230
and there was love one lawyer on the

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,910
table as well so the units are thinking

00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,460
about these patterns and if they can

00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:08,670
evolve a legal construct from this idea

00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,890
okay and abling the end user whoever has

00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:14,190
the device to replace the software and

00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:16,560
install their own thing without granting

00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:20,430
the same liability on the outcome of

00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,720
this thing we will see so I'm really

00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,440
interested in that outcome

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,860
so there's lack for it any further

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,860
questions

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:39,120
I just wanted to add two small notes

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,240
you mentioned voiding the warranty if

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,289
the user changes the firm we need to be

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,929
careful with that because that's

00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:47,909
actually not legal in the EU you cannot

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,770
avoid warranty exclusively because the

00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:51,330
user has changed the software have to

00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,179
prove that the change of the software

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:59,760
yeah made something wrong with the

00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:02,279
device basically so and another note at

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,710
kelabra we develop a few tools which you

00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:07,710
may or may not find useful for Debian

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,129
derivatives for like creating images for

00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,790
example

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,500
it's called Deb OS so I use a slightly

00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,859
different work for than we do because we

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,419
have a no BS which builds the binary

00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:21,270
packages out of the dipping sauces and

00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:23,909
then we like use the apt feeds and we

00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:27,359
build images out of that but still you

00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:29,790
may find the the little useful that's it

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,099
yeah yeah we definitely look into what

00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:34,619
Debian tools being used in the community

00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,210
we don't try to divide a v8 from this

00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,619
wherever possible but yeah there are

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,109
some special requirements that we are

00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:44,879
dealing with that sometimes make it

00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:47,330
easier in the other way yeah any further

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,330
questions

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:54,989
if not then let's thank young again

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,989
[Applause]
