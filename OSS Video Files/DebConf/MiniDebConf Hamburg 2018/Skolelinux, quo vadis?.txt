enact the next talk will about Dominic

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:20,150
goryeo and my cap here on Debbie Nadeau

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:22,060
is scolding knocks yeah welcome to our

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,949
talk thanks for being here

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,689
yeah she already heard in the

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:29,420
introduction we will be talking about

00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:33,890
Debian II do who of you has already

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:38,719
heard about the Debian IDO project very

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,960
cool okay who of you has heard about

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:48,739
scholarly gnomes

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:53,829
okay for those who have no whom can you

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:58,100
use a small refreshment on what this is

00:00:53,829 --> 00:01:02,000
debian edu is a project inside inside

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,339
Evian it's a it's a pure blend and cares

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,149
about everything that has to do with the

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:13,490
use of Debian in in schools and in

00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:19,119
education in several regards

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,119
first of all Debian neither of us

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,700
pre-configured an installation media

00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:28,149
that can be used to install and and

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,459
operate a full fully featured

00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:35,300
educational network for schools both for

00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:38,239
operating servers we're including all

00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,989
the nice things like managing host and

00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:46,039
group groups of computers for computer

00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:51,700
labs for example users access rights for

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:55,039
the users and stuff around that like

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:59,440
doing doing backups having internal

00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:02,569
email for the users stuff like that and

00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,550
also which is probably the most

00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:08,420
important part network good environment

00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:10,819
so computer labs can be booted over the

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,160
network using PXE or can be installed

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,060
over the network and on top of that

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,230
there's a desktop environments that is

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,239
that can be installed pre-configured to

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,900
very well with this with this Network

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:29,310
and it offers quite a huge set of

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,420
educational software that can be used by

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:37,549
in the different different subjects that

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:40,890
its school from yeah we're starting from

00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:45,090
from informatics of course but also

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:48,690
office an office huge educational

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,400
software for geography biology chemistry

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:56,250
and now all that I think do you know how

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,099
many packages are appreciated say I

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,260
think it's not secure statistics I think

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:06,000
it's something around 100 that are

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:09,329
pre-selected and of course as it is as

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,060
it basically it is just a beyond of

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:19,049
course there are tons of other packages

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:25,040
for educational use available today we

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:28,280
want to mainly talk about what what will

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,810
what we in what we intend to happen to

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,819
Debian II do this year or in the

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,310
foreseeable future what has already

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,200
happened give us more update about what

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:44,099
what happened what's happened in the

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:47,760
past and to to get started with that we

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,980
will start by telling a bit about

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
different groups of people who are

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:57,389
interested in the video or maybe should

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,069
be or sadly aren't yet who knows and I

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,840
can you tell a bit about the development

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,669
of schooling works and what is what is

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,949
special about it what makes it special

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:08,879
inside Debian and what developers do

00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:11,340
what we care for him yes thank you so

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,730
I'm I'm one of the Debian developers the

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,410
Debian - but of the Debian developers

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,160
and there are other people here in the

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,570
room that actually receive our highest

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,789
appreciation one of them is actually

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,080
Wolfgang who has been keeping the

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,900
development up for the last three years

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,250
then it's Holger who is sort of involved

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,450
in everything and also in Debian Edwin

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,320
is doing a great job as a release

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,320
manager so

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,650
the the main thing for the last like two

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,139
years we have to mention is that Debian

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,860
adore is really has really traveled back

00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,510
inside W so it was some overlay thing

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,910
with extra packages outside of Debian

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,070
for quite a few years and the release

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,830
cycle of Debian arrow was sort of laid

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,740
back in comparison to Debian so at the

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,630
moment it's like there is the first

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,280
release of the next step in stable and

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,530
with the first point release or the

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,620
second at the latest you have the Debian

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,229
a tow system ready for installation so

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,810
and I guess that's Hogue and Wolfgang

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,030
who mainly earned the credits so if you

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:19,479
want to clap your hands that's the point

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:22,610
you should do thank you and and also

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:24,650
over the years that I've sort of either

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,289
contributed or observed the Debian

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,150
editor development it's it's really like

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:32,000
chasing a moving target all the time so

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,979
it's it's it's quite a hard job to

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,349
actually sort of follow up what is

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,150
changing in Debian over a release cycle

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,710
and then the free account and then you

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,770
have like four weeks or up to eight

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,330
weeks maybe to actually put the last

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,870
chicks or pieces together and get the

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,389
system up and running so that you put in

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,500
your ISO image or your USB stick and

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:55,729
install from that and then you mainly

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:02,120
have something like a small business

00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:05,180
server for school so so plans for

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,310
technical plans for development so at

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,710
the moment on the school level or the

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,740
municipality level in different counties

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,050
of all over Germany you have the

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,410
challenge or they they actually give the

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,539
challenge to us to not set up and insert

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,270
a school system at one school but they

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,560
want to actually connect their schools

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,990
have a user identity management system

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,599
across the municipality or even across

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,060
the county and we are not ready for that

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:35,060
but we are looking at it on a technical

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,729
level to actually hook different it's

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,229
called a Linux installation together

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,570
either with another school in your

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:44,719
installation as a master server or a

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,039
dual master server setup or which is

00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:49,490
quite

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,409
at the moment is that the unive Anton

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,800
people with the UCS at school product

00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:59,349
they actually have a foot at their foot

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,699
in the on the on the county level so the

00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,889
educational ministries they sort of get

00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:06,379
in touch with Univ engine get to know

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,360
the UCS server and start deploying an

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:12,680
identity management system for teachers

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,389
and students and they are interested and

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,159
we are interested actually on hooking

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,379
those two systems together like the

00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:21,639
skeletal system being a slave machine

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:26,479
for a countywide or municipality right

00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:31,009
UCS anything else development wise that

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:40,999
we should mention here okay yeah thank

00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:43,520
you so there's obviously one one group

00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:51,860
of people who are interested in schools

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:54,759
as users which are teachers and yeah you

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,759
know how that goes

00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:01,279
teachers have lessons to do they have to

00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:06,080
prepare lessons they run their lessons

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:11,169
and sometimes they want to do those new

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:15,610
shiny digital things sometimes they even

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:18,050
do and don't only want to do and then

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,959
most important thing for teachers is

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,149
that they are offered a system that that

00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,449
simply works there's no there's no time

00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:28,939
for digging around in the system making

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,329
making something work trying endlessly

00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:35,870
whether something will will be fine at

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:38,569
the end and I just want to basically

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,240
enter the computer lab sit a class down

00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:43,909
good machines have them log in and it

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,449
and the system works and sometimes

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:50,649
there's quite a big difference between

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:54,380
what developers think works and what

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,910
users think works sometimes there's even

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:00,870
a bigger difference in what teachers

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:04,889
think who works so

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,649
one of the important things that at the

00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:10,139
at the point where they where we as

00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:13,440
developing community you come together

00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,360
with with schools is finding out what I

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,240
want what what issues they have and

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:29,190
tailoring the system to to the special

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:32,389
needs yeah students are using the system

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:36,000
as well they are using they are used to

00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:38,100
mostly used to the Windows desktops or

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,380
sometimes Mac OS or their smartphones

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:46,079
there are some there's there are some

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,420
some issues that are that are new to new

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,420
to me that that there are new issues

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,720
every year I work with many children and

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:59,639
anatella sons in in different projects

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:05,730
and I think one interesting story is

00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:09,180
when that like 10 years ago when I

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:14,089
started no more 12 years ago when I

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,089
started giving lessons to children they

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:21,389
there was a half of a classroom that did

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,329
not use a computer on regular basis at

00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:26,220
home then two years later everyone was

00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:30,319
using a computer on a regular basis at

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,329
home and they all knew their way around

00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:35,639
basically they could use mal a mouse and

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:40,170
the keyboard they could basically writes

00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:42,259
textin and office application and what

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,519
what in that regard there was basically

00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:51,000
refinement of these of this knowledge

00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:56,069
going on and for a few years now I have

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,089
been stumbling across students in fifth

00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:01,319
or sixth grade or something and they are

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:05,610
about to type something on the computer

00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:08,569
and tell them yeah there is a there are

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,860
spaces missing in your code and you say

00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:12,220
what is the they ask what is the

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,410
spacebar

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,110
and this is because they have this is

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,269
because they they are used to their

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,319
smartphones they type in Word and it's

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,800
just out a correction in the

00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:27,110
auto-completion and then it yeah and the

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,899
user interface is changing and maybe

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,470
this is also a difficulty that will that

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:35,449
will become bigger and in that regard

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,920
and then if some more regards it's very

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:40,489
important to also listen to students

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:51,100
when it comes to a system deployed and

00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:51,100
huge it's good yeah so Mike well I guess

00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:02,420
okay so about the support system um my

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,939
tea at school used to be something for

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,980
one or two teachers if you were lucky

00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:09,290
you were two of you there were two of

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,019
you who could set up a network one

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,410
server and some workstations I think

00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:17,720
this time has passed so I tea at schools

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,939
you wouldn't you wouldn't fix your sink

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,709
you would call a plumber so if the

00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:24,610
computer labs broke me you normally

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:28,970
these days you call an IT company and

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:31,699
and promoting scholarly nooks in Germany

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,499
means that there needs to be at some

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:37,160
point we need to be really quick setting

00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:38,299
up a support structure and in former

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,610
times there was a stall any nook

00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,589
certificate so if you wanted to become a

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,009
school in next admin administration

00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:48,470
company or admin on a personal level you

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:50,649
had to obtain your certificate and there

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,819
were coaching's consulting sessions

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,329
training sessions for those companies

00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:59,360
providing professional support we are

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,889
thinking about reviving that we have in

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,740
northern Germany we have a couple of

00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,389
schools and there was one company what

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,490
that was doing first level support that

00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:09,970
was supervised by me and at the moment

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,189
there are more companies coming in and I

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:17,449
am about to start a like third level

00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:19,970
support concept so that you can book my

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:24,410
company or actually my service person to

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,730
support scholarly nooks and I think and

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,579
and that that we

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,410
if you want to facilitate people using

00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,480
free software at schools we need to sort

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,299
of consolidate that on a highly

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,040
professional level in fact and this is

00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:44,299
something that you might be talking in

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:46,309
two minutes about as well yeah so we

00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:49,040
need to think about professionalism here

00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:51,019
and get people into scholarly nooks in

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,209
terms of how to configure that system

00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:55,209
because it's not Debian it's different

00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,790
yeah that's me too um

00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:08,269
brief history so I came to scholarliness

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,160
in 2011 and that was at a quite well was

00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:13,249
quite difficult of time actually there

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,439
was a a countywide solution in one of

00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:18,109
the more southern counties in Germany

00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,089
that sort of well the overall result was

00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:21,799
it failed because there was a lot of

00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,350
work done for scholarly knows or with

00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,119
scholarly knows actually and it ended up

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:30,589
with none of that being upstream back to

00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:32,209
Debian so and we also had the

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:35,059
observation that there was the

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:37,429
international team which was like the

00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:39,649
developers hanging around on hash Debian

00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:42,439
IDO on IRC and on the Debian IDO English

00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:44,839
mailing list and there was a say

00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:47,980
marketing group in Germany at least not

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,720
sure about other countries that attended

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,399
Linux days and set up a booth there and

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,679
talked about school in nooks and these

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,279
two groups they sort of got actually

00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:59,720
they diverged they well there was the

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:04,639
there was a lack of communication at

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,089
some point and I think here and also

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,929
with previous meetings we are about to

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:13,309
change that because the scholarly nooks

00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:16,939
representation in Germany has just been

00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:21,199
moved over to the Tecates NGO in Germany

00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:22,639
and and we have two developers Debian

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,679
developers there one day be a NATO

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,589
developer which is Nick

00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,480
so that the what was sort of split apart

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:31,609
a bit has been split apart it's now

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,910
actually rejoining again which is really

00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,910
good

00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:49,110
okay so at the end of last year yeah

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:52,860
things I have to be honest on regarding

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:59,010
regarding the use of of school Enochs

00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:01,339
Debbie NATO and publicity and the

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,490
community support community meetings

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:08,940
everything looked very sad and that's

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:13,290
why we start an effort to revive some

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,180
things and what we watch what happened

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,839
this year I running out of time so I

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,279
have to hurry hurry Blitzer the

00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,980
community coordination was transferred

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,389
to an NGO tickets

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,339
evie some of you might hear about it

00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:32,279
there's also a lightning talk scheduled

00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:34,350
for ya later and we care about many

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:37,680
things concerning education and entry

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,660
software and what we want to do is what

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,050
Mike already said we want to bring these

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:47,540
different groups the users people who

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:51,360
support the system people who represent

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,360
the software that the project at at

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,709
conferences and developers in Germany

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,269
and other countries we want to bring

00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:03,390
them closer together which has started

00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:07,169
to work quite well there have been there

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:09,660
free meetings in the past with in Norway

00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:12,299
that we tended and here is Deb it's a

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,240
DEP conf and yeah there's quite a bit

00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:17,760
going on we have updated a website

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,679
there's a nice landing page for people

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,500
who are looking for a product because

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:30,890
that's maybe one important catch word

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:35,070
because part yeah Wilks T because

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:37,559
teachers or people who make decisions

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,000
for the use of software in schools they

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,410
don't want the wiki and the mailing this

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,350
and some that something that they want

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,450
they want to find a product of something

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,950
that looks like a product and that is

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:51,340
one thing that we want to

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,780
want to move the presentation the

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,300
direction we want to move the

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,580
presentation to and we started doing

00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,830
surveys with the companies who once

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,520
offered support for Damon Edo and with

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:05,680
some schools how they use it which is in

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,310
in in quite an early stage I hope that's

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,600
who we will be able to present

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:17,560
successful details about that at

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:19,240
satellite a conference yeah okay for

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,550
those of you who are interested in

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,120
education and children and free software

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,770
in general yo welcome to attempt the

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,050
lightning talk where I will give a few

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,370
details about what Tecates does together

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,540
with children we are very eager to

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,320
integrate children in the free software

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:41,020
community normally there would have been

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,390
some kids around here as well but this

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,750
didn't work out because the travel and

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,500
in the end students all of all of that

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,750
films are just attempted lightning talk

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,820
just a picture all the children

00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:02,740
interested in Debian and free software

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:03,520
it's some conference okay so goes for

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,480
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,340
bring all the groups together on a

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,550
technical level we want to say repeat

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,170
some words again yeah so one go I forgot

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,690
and one person I forgot to mention is

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,890
Phil hands the Lanza's a DD as well he

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,810
is here at the conference and he's

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,880
trying to get the Debian IDO installer

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,820
into the Debian installer sort of

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,040
workflow things so that we actually we

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,230
used to be we used to build the Debian

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,720
EDI so images on a separate machine and

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,460
I was always a bit tricky so we hope for

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,070
the Buster release that we have that in

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,320
the Debian installer build environment

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,750
and that Debian builds the Debian IDO

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,100
installer CDs so that's one release one

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,440
go for for 2018 another goal is that we

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,690
want to promote the remote desktop part

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,890
in Debian a - a bit more so that one one

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,260
outstanding feature that other products

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,780
at the moment don't have is that you can

00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,320
remote log on to your system from home

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,419
as a teacher and

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,450
test what you want to do in class in the

00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:08,450
evening before on the same system

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,950
hardware software it especially compared

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,809
to what you have in school so that is

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,490
one issue that's always breaking they

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,809
prepare stuff at home and have different

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,789
Network conditions and different

00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,860
operating systems and then they are in

00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,419
class and then it takes 50 minutes to

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,730
setup what they want to show or it

00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,779
doesn't work at all so that's one thing

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:29,960
remote desktop that we will integrate

00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:31,309
and it's it's an outstanding feature not

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,950
available in other products at the

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:38,450
moment anything else you want to secure

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,669
the file system level a little bit more

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,549
so we will talk we will not talk about

00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:51,950
that here but there needs to be some

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:58,750
work done okay it's not yet ready it

00:20:51,950 --> 00:21:02,779
needs work okay so most important thing

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,980
every project always needs needs help

00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:08,000
both in the in the device in the

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,399
development parts but also in the

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,309
community efforts we need people who are

00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:16,279
interested in in doing some support in

00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:20,330
promoting Debian edu and school news or

00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:22,460
an even free software and education in

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,330
general if you aren't interested in that

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,940
maybe just talk to one of us today or

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:32,090
whenever you like there are two mailing

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:35,600
lists one one for the for the Germany

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,669
efforts with which is more support and

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,580
community coordination and less

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:44,750
development and the general English

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,000
speaking this Debian edu is yeah it's

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,330
more about about development and

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,009
technical stuff yeah so bronze we are

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,870
interested in the in the community side

00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:58,519
and the presentational side and

00:21:53,870 --> 00:22:01,100
promotion and community you will find

00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:04,340
details about how to contact tickets on

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:09,409
the tickets website so there are many

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:12,320
many ways you can help one one word

00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:13,610
about Germany mailing list we make the

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,870
observation yesterday

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,610
that the technical level on the

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:22,309
manliness was a bit well the art there

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,900
were questions and no answers or people

00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:25,640
answering other people that did not

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,549
really have insight in Debian arrows so

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,549
which is okay but what what especially I

00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:34,700
put on my agenda is that that I provide

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:37,850
support on the German list a bit more

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,950
than I used to do so so that we actually

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,260
raised the Nebo on the mailing list and

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,990
also the frequency of posts and the

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:49,240
response time to posts from from users

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:52,820
and the other thing is that it's also

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,960
the channel for organization and stuff

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,809
around square-enix now so okay that's

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,700
what Nick is doing a lot for more ways

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,400
how to support free software education

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,490
in general can a reference to the

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,650
lightning talk and yeah so times over I

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:19,130
think so thanks for attending and

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:22,760
listening that questions or comments

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:25,040
just one comment which is not so much

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,970
about Debian I do but about other blends

00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,460
as we try to get it builder Debian

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,620
installation image and in that we might

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,840
create a traditional way but the other

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,510
question saw unsolved from the stretch

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,120
release is having a blends installer CD

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,280
in Debian there was some effort but then

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,830
it was too late because fetch was frozen

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,630
Buster freezes on half a year so we have

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,320
half a year to make blends installable

00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,400
and Debian

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,620
somebody's interested please pick it up

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:59,770
so that it blends in general over blends

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,770
okay any further questions

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,560
yeah yes a general question in which

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,620
countries is currently scholarly Lussier

00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,810
used nowadays because I know that

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,550
there's some other or at least at some

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,440
other educational institutions that were

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,700
created years ago back I don't know the

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,950
status having different countries across

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,600
Europe is our so currently where is

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,120
called a lewdness actually used more in

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,500
Germany Norway other countries also

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,960
that's a good question effect do we have

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,150
there was there was on the old school

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,340
Reno's website there was a collecting

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,170
database and schools could you know put

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,630
their names on and then they didn't

00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,950
remove the names so so in fact that's

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,920
something we should put on our to do

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,180
this to get an overview here's so there

00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,320
are a few schools in northern Germany

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,570
that I know of

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,870
a few schools schools in Northwest

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:55,320
failure some in run on files probably

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,000
some in Oslo I know or they do like they

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,220
they learn from the techniques in Debian

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,460
ADA but use a plain Debian system to set

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,740
it up so there's a lot of school and

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,680
Linux stuff going on in in Greece at the

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,300
moment so I guess data talk at the DEF

00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,300
CON in Montreal which was really

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,340
impressing there lots of dots on the map

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:19,230
where Linux with ltsp a debian with a

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:21,230
DSP was the point so but I can't really

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,090
answer your question I'm sorry

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:27,660
so same kind of question about the

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:30,540
support and the organizations around ska

00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,280
Linux do you know if any other kind of

00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,320
organization like the one you described

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,030
like your company who is doing support

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:42,570
but in Germany and take kids

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:44,820
it's Nanji oh yeah so I'm doing that

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,500
really as a business thing so you can

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,510
contact me for third level second level

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,490
first level support the first level

00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:54,210
support I will hand over to a partner

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:57,720
company at the moment you do it on an

00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,210
NGO level so you to write invoices to

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,820
the schools and then you use it for the

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,280
association or for well maybe also have

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,040
contracts with individual persons if

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,170
you're a school you can also contract or

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,300
address me if you want a certain feature

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,680
and you want that in Debian like a new

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,419
software that is free software but I'm

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,850
getting package

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,809
then it's also it could be idea that you

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,999
address me either

00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,350
I package it for you or I know someone

00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:24,999
in Debian who's already working on that

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:27,499
and we sort of you know dispatch then

00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:29,830
also there are some companies on the

00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:32,629
wiki so maybe you want to mention them

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,519
there's a on the on the Debian Vicki

00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:35,149
there's there's an area for for Debian

00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:37,070
EW

00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:39,379
which is also linked on the on the

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:42,590
German schools website and I think the

00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:45,009
screams and oh and squad org point there

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:49,460
there's the least professional support

00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:51,499
with quite a big list of companies all

00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:58,070
over the world who do support for Debian

00:26:51,499 --> 00:27:01,009
IDO we are just working on on on

00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,739
cleaning on tidying up the list for the

00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:05,960
German companies because it is very

00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:09,919
outdated I think this is also true for

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,859
the other countries we know of three

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,019
companies throughout Germany whose who

00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:18,169
gave us feedback that they are or will

00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:20,600
be actively supporting the system on a

00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,309
professional the problem is if you have

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,289
been a scholarly supporter like four

00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,090
years ago and then now it's someone

00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:28,190
approaches you and says I once called in

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,899
your support it's a completely different

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:34,029
system different user management now

00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:36,559
with cameras blah blah blah so so so I

00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,509
really really want to invite those

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,960
companies that want to support schooling

00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:44,149
us to get in touch with firstly the

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,179
developer group on hash Debian 8 or on

00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:49,279
the Debian arrow English mailing list or

00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:51,919
contact either of us and see how action

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,629
interaction can happen so just doing it

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,820
and then promising Devine who will work

00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:57,799
for your for certain customer and then

00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,730
it fades that is not good for the

00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,769
project education

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,769
ok sorry times up thanks again

00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,190
