Title: GIS, JavaEE, Leaflet on OpenShift - Steven Pousty
Publication date: 2016-02-12
Playlist: OpenShift
Description: 
	Learn how to build simple open source mapping solutions using several different languages and datastores. We’ll start by selecting our source data and a db. Then, we’ll pick language and a simple microframework to power a basic REST API. Finally, we’ll add Leaflet Maps for user-facing data visualization and controls.

retaining what I learned myself until I

00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,809
have reached out to solution hyphen D

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,090

I'm are amazing does that is the

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,060
experiment let me clear would how its if

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:22,650
i get a tutorial at PyCon i reek but

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,020
doesn't work i remember seeing it before

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,390
I just go right I sorted it was

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,090
optimistic that we clear and invisibly

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,829
chopped to follow along too many people

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,210
live okay so that went to set up Brett

to do it thanks guys I will be probably

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,380
heading out of the conference over wait

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,840
for me ok once you go by never wait for

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,970

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,590
all i'm saying is the next time go ahead

00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,970
don't like what she's looking at once

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,580

yes

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,959
one hour talk I do that the minute I

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,090
don't want you look I know that people

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,580
out of them and it's not the same fun

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,170
when uses it on a Josh question yeah if

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,709
we see the slides that you don't have

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,209
anybody to watch right it's true are we

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,250
supposed to be starting right now for

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:22,110
sick okay fine are we supposed to start

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:25,549
an hour how when do we start what you

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,819
said that jakub said that right yeah

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:32,130
rock if you have to lead now security

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,750
summit of the principal's office what

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:40,760
are you talking about he does that one

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,760
work and stuff like yahoo can't go

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:53,730
exactly most of all he would be bumpy

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,349
this is the UH in the talk is being

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,730
hosted is live on a website so if you

00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,560
want to actually bring up the slide your

00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,820
stuff you probably want to do that

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,269
because there are some links in it as

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,989
well if you so this is a hands-on

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,410
workshop we have an hour and a half

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:10,140
right so it's two sessions right that's

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,000
what I remember does everybody know that

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,680
they've signed up for an hour and a half

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,760
workshop yes good so now at the time

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,039
this is the flight to the

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,140
hour-and-a-half session if you boarded

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,090
the wrong flight in error please make

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:28,620
your way to the exit and important your

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,970
proper the appropriate flight this is

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,830
going to be hands-on i'm going to

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,150
introduce some concepts and then you're

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,300
going to do some very simple application

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,970
deployment and configuration on open

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,860
should be three okay we're not going to

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,180
do it actually any edit code changes

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,190
although you're quite welcome to do that

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,289
later if you want and i can show you how

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,210
we're also not even going to use the

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,820
command line tools we're going to do all

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,950
of this in the web interface okay so you

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,020
do not in the other sessions going on

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,780
today everybody had to use command line

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,409
tools today we do not have to because

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,989
we're doing a bear

00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:03,029
simple okay so let's go ahead and get

00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:04,919
started let me ask put some quick

00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:08,879
questions you level set how many of you

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,649
used open should be three really the red

00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,409
how people that are on my team aren't

00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:16,679
raising their hands nice how many of you

00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,999
have done spatial work before GI asks

00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:25,439
something like that what did you use

00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:29,580
hose jazz home fun yeah what did you

00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,959
close GIS leave floods okay so when I

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,489
believe the partner allowed to check

00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:37,909
your email but the other part you're not

00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:41,759
left okay nice cooperate Oh Morgan yeah

00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:44,189
anyone else is doing spatial work nobody

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,169
okay so this is I'm going to assume most

00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:47,639
people have not used open shift most

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,569
people have not done spatial work how

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,329
many people have written a web

00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:55,019
application and used in debt like it

00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:59,579
javascript file okay good how many of

00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:02,519
you are a Java developers most okay if

00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,289
you're not I apologize we're going to

00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,599
have to show java code it was kind of in

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,579
the talk titled i believe that i was

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:12,419
going to do snow wasn't in the abstract

00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,589
no I lead to Gemma come out if you

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,240
really don't want to see any java code

00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,279
if it offends you on a deep moral level

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,779
i will understand if you get up and down

00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,319
as well and then we're going to shows

00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,729
how many beanies yeah only the

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
wrap up the only the people who did open

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,379
shifty to know ok so I'm going to

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,029
actually talk about all good so the

00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,399
agenda is very simple a little bit about

00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:36,300
MongoDB spatial only the spatial fit to

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,909
them some java ee and then no that's not

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,039
happening ignore that one yeah we're

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,379
going to actually deploy some code ok

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,499
and have an app for me and then you

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,429
deploy assumptions you you can ignore

00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:50,309
that one because we're not going to

00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:53,749
write any and then you ask questions how

00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,749
many people have already gotten a

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,889
beautiful scarf how many people already

00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:02,699
gotten the beautiful scarf only three

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:06,149
okay so ask a question get a beautiful

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,480
scarf and I give up multiple stars to

00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,310
the same people if you have

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,180
partner at home that needs a scarf or

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:16,660
dog not for cattle what's the scenario

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,730
that we're doing we work for our vendor

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,320
that sells beer baseball stadiums and

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,760
since as well most other countries be

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,700
here's a baseball stadium to the United

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,820
States separate know what baseball is

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:30,910
you throw the it's like cricket only

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,170
just as confusing right if you try the

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,870
ball you hit with the bat you run around

00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:37,480
the bases right and there's a lot of the

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,430
United States we're making a checking

00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,860
service to help drive traffic to our

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,270
crappy beer stands we sell very bad beer

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,530
we want to try to get more people to

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,590
come to the station so hopefully maybe

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,540
sell more beer okay we want to free and

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,080
open source on the whole stash no

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,250
lock-in and it's due next week so your

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,380
product manager comes to you and say

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,400
this have to happen by next week right

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,790
so you have to do this actually

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:04,390
relatively quickly well this is where I

00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:08,290
hate let's see if I can get this to go

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:13,240
smaller can you read that in the back

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:14,860
now though kind of the old men point but

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,630
though maybe the old men should all move

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,340
up to the front of the classroom so they

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,760
can read the stuff on the slide I'm here

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,890
already so the bunch of different type

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,560
of no sequel data stores right so I want

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,510
to put my MongoDB where it sits in the

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,450
ecosystem so i'm assuming everyone's

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,540
heard of no sequel is that about right

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,830
yeah no sequel davis course okay so i'm

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,150
going to go through a bunch of different

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,919
types i'm going to give you an example

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,169
and then usually the use cases that

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,849
they're used for so there's document

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,400
data stores and i'm not talking about

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,620
like a word document or PDF I mean like

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,960
you're actually storing a dot data

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,970
document into the database there's too

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,730
many types of that MongoDB and cap space

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,430
for CouchDB right and they're usually

00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:00,190
used for document storage and search so

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,200
you put in a document of data and you

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,630
store and you searching and we're going

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,270
to cover more today there's key

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,660
value and those are usually example

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,640
about a Redis react memcache right and

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,980
so that's usually caching or an object

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,440
store so you have a key and a value and

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,390
that's all

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,160
you have in the table right you have a

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,720
key and a value so this is really good

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,060
for something like a web page where the

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,640
key is the URL and the value is the

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,950
rendered HTML for the web page right

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,750
very quick and easy to pull out the web

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,010
page and serve it back up and it just

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,140
coming out of memory rather than having

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,480
your server works there's graph

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,520
databases these are new the prime

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,010
example I think of this is neo4j and

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,470
this is used for storing relationships

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,450
between objects so if you think of

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,700
something like Twitter or Facebook where

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,010
there's a social back you can very

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,410
easily do this in a graph database it

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:54,050
stores like you know prime example as

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:57,080
they do like star wars and they say

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,390
Darth Vader is the father of Luke and

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,980
Leia and then they do the reverse on

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,910
that graph which they say Luke and Leia

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,800
you know our children of dark start

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,630
Vader than they have a train with and

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,370
they do the whole raft that's what you

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,140
do with graph databases it's also

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,090
usually very good for certain types of

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,440
geographic data you guys is everybody

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,060
here from the Czech Republic or most

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,940
people if you're not from the US yeah

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:25,310
poulan anybody else besides the Czech

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,750
Republic that wants to get a scarf this

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,120
is an easy question you just say what

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,490
country you're from your country you

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,480
from Russia you already have a scar

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:39,170
you're even wearing a sari yeah holders

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,460
were both at the same time okay so in

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,750
the United States and I don't know if

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,610
you have in the Czech Republic but we

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,380
have when they do the census is ever

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,360
going to know the censuses you know we

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,700
go out and you count all the people they

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,460
break that into geographic entities that

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,350
nest inside of each other right resource

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,360
a hierarchical data set those work

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,490
really well in neo4j because you can

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,440
walk the Leafs down the tree all the way

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,200
down back up and down the tree to find

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,630
which geography you're in data

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,670
processing has things like Hadoop and

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,130
Cassandra and Baltimore these are large

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,980
data processing and then there's miss

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,630
and this I put in things that don't fit

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,700
into the other large category so

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,320
examples in here or leucine solar to

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,470
last a search that's kind of one whole

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,380
thing we've seen in lucena the basis for

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,780
both solar and Alaska search and those

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,769
are that's document in the word PDF

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,660
document or

00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:32,239
it's a free text index for searching for

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,850
things it actually has spatial as well

00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:37,759
this has facial some of these have

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,809
spatial bees have spatial whole DVI put

00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,920
in there because i know it's made by

00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,989
stonebraker but i don't know what the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,399
hell it does so i just put a ninja so

00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:46,339
because stonebraker has done so much

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,230
before that I feel like he earns having

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,239
me mention his database but I don't

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,670
actually know what it does yeah Harrison

00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:56,480
you know what it does yeah optimized for

00:11:52,670 --> 00:12:01,480
high volume so it's optimized for rice

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,480
but is it a relational database it is

00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,889
compliant by it but it's really

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,709
optimized for rice and use something

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,379
else and then circuit backup for reads

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,549
okay thanks I still won't see that in

00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:14,839
the next show I go to because then some

00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,360
don't think I know something about for

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,189
TV so that's the different types of no

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,839
sequel data stores and now i'm going to

00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:24,009
just talk about and now I can make

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,089
this bigger I think so big that MongoDB

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,100
document when we're talking about a girl

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,009
it's just a bunch of attributes and

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,019
values so for those since I assumed you

00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:36,649
were Java developers that's a butt like

00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:39,410
a hashmap in Java right and in Python

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:41,149
it's a dictionary it's just hash value

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,339
of hash value and just like in both of

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:45,230
those languages dictionaries can contain

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,360
dictionaries hash maps can contain hash

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,129
maps they can contain lists the same

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,709
thing is going to happen in a MongoDB

00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:53,749
document and so it's a JSON document is

00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,779
really what it is right except it's

00:12:53,749 --> 00:13:00,850
actually be song not Jason so be solemn

00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:02,809
vs 0 n is binary Script object notation

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,850
and the reason why they're using

00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:06,350
besought rather than JSON is they want

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,889
the ability to actually store dates

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,389
dates are used a lot in databases and if

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,740
you put it in as a string you can't do

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:14,029
as much and beasts on it's actually a

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,490
date and you can do queries against

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:19,910
dates like range data queries on dates

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,799
and stuff like that all right I already

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,139
explained as it can be nested which

00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:27,019
helps to avoid joins the main reason why

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:29,600
people built the founders who built

00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:31,910
MongoDB in the beginning was they wanted

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,639
to get away from my sequel and they

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,649
wanted to avoid avoid joins right and

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,270
this is really good for something like a

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,700
social

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,440
in service right where you have somebody

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,570
checking in at a bunch of geographic

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,760
locations you can actually have the

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,290
person and store all of their geographic

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,660
locations that they've checked in in

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,370
their document so or you can store the

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,530
last three or something like that places

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,150
they've checked in so that way when you

00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,580
say hey give me this person's check in

00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,050
history it just pulls what it does one

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,670
query they pulled back a document and

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,660
can display all of it and you've never

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,220
done a joint subbing sense right then so

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,930
everything that comes with this I'm

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,480
going to give you the bad part about it

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,210
too right I am not necessarily like

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,030
MongoDB all things the bat was the bad

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,340
part about this I'm not going to give it

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:25,450
you're gonna tell me what's the bad part

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:27,340
about not having joins what redundant

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,530
data and updating of it but you're not

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,930
getting another gene another you don't

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,760
need another scarf you have a bunch of

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,820
them you're going to go sell them when

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:41,130
you go back to Russia all right okay

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,130
your two kids is that what you said

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,490
because I'll get another one to give

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,320
another kid so you're right you're never

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,670
done that data so if you think you're

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,770
storing all the locations where the

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,530
person checked in and somehow the title

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,300
of that location has changed you can't

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,160
you have to actually go search for all

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,480
the old locations and update to manually

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,820
rather than updating them in one table

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,030
right so it's a really bad chance of

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,550
getting data orphans in here its key

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:08,980
with us and what I should say is the

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,860
schema is freeform it has a schema but

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,500
it mongodb never enforces its kima at

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,820
all right so another thing that the

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,930
people who are building long ago did

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,550
when they wanted to start was they

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,410
wanted to aim it towards developers

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,020
rather than people who have to deal with

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,670
work right so when you do you work with

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,510
a company with a big Oracle schema and

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,540
you have a lot of database

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,850
administrators or is it just you you

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,170
have just okay but if you want to make a

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,690
change to the schema do you have to put

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,890
in a change request yes yeah so and then

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,220
how long does it take to get that change

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,220
request

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,600
we drive Otis ourselves so we are when

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,430
they go what you do at your end

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,010
customers we don't know that customers

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:49,019
will develop something okay but when you

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,730
have to ask a DB have been for a schema

00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,380
change and you put in a change request

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,680
how long is that it usually take if you

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:59,160
can't do it yourself if it would be just

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,450
a schema changing okay so when I but

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,399
you're still waiting to write your code

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:06,510
for about an hour yeah but if I have to

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,709
read the code and do things more okay

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,980
you have to deploy and all that stuff

00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:13,860
with as soon as you change your

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,930
code it makes the change the database so

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,250
if you say oh I change this table you

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,110
know I need another column which is

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,700
great your product manager comes to use

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,769
hey I need their identification of their

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,029
passport number so when you model the

00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,980
user you didn't have that in there

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,490
before you had a line in your code that

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,170
says insert passport number and the you

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,029
put it into the same collection which is

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,980
like a table and suddenly you have

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,570
passport numbers getting inserted in the

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,579
documents and they go in no problem

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,079
that's pretty nice right you never have

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,459
to talk to a DB and then you actually

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,500
don't even have to write any ddl

00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,390
statements right there's no writing any

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:54,720
schema it just goes what's the bad part

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:57,990
about that that's right so the bad part

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,690
about that is I put the tape I write the

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,430
name to be passport and oh and someone

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,500
else write something to be passport num

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,150
in their coat and now we've got two

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,419
different fields getting pushed into the

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,770
collection and they're not the same

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:12,179
right and you don't and you have no way

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,459
of knowing so there's been times with my

00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,050
code in one piece doesn't match the

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,720
query that i'm doing i'm inserting by

00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,459
hand and I'm like where did my day to go

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,250
and what it did is it actually with

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,110
 you can go all the way up to the

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,199
collection level actually even the DB

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,780
level if your code uses the slightly

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,900
different dbname mom go we'll just go

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,190
ahead and make a completely new DB right

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,720
so you could be writing into two

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,550
completely different db's and you be

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,010
like where's all my data and you don't

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,200
know or if you're putting in numbers

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,340
into a field and someone doesn't get the

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
message that it's supposed to be a

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,820
number and

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,250
start putting any strings manga is not

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,740
going to care it's not going to stop you

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,049
from being stupid right so we're

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,000
basically what is a patently with manga

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,250
is all the stuff that we liked being

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,059
bacon to relational databases you have

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:05,090
to move up into your application tier

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:07,370
that's what's happening it's really good

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:10,850
at fast rights but you give up a media

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:13,100
consistency right so you can toot you

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,789
can tune it so that it actually does one

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,679
phase transactions so it says I don't I

00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:20,450
want you to I don't want you to return

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,000
back to me until you've actually written

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,070
it to the database and it's been charted

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,220
out but at that point your speed is the

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,720
same as a relational database right so

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,950
what a lot of people use model for is

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,559
because it's really good at fast right

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,510
it's you can actually tune it to say as

00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,669
soon as the network stack gets the

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,200
pocket saying they want the writing not

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:42,350
even into memory just as the network

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,950
staff gets it return back to the return

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,970
back to the client and say you got it

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,350
all right so that's really great if

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,270
you're writing some sort of like a

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,559
logging application where you're

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,149
grabbing lot of files where you don't

00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,309
care if you miss a few here and there

00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,870
but you really might want to make sure

00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,149
that you're not blocking on anybody

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,679
trying to write you can basically just

00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:02,029
keep plowing stuff in it is as soon as

00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,159
it hits the network's targets it's great

00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:06,440
go back great go back so look that's why

00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,570
all the node.js people loved it right

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,429
because with all that a sync stuff they

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,980
could just return right back with the

00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:16,309
async stuff right away they're going to

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:20,090
get that mark the problem though is if

00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:21,529
that machine goes down anytime after its

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:26,980
hit the network stack you're not your

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:29,570
data is never going to get rid of this

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,010
supposed to be easy to horizontally

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,960
scale I have not done this myself and

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,470
I've heard burying reports from the

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,510
field about how easy that is it was

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,520
built though at a time when heart the

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,950
developer has already understood that

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,590
the new way of scaling is not vertical

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,909
anymore it's horizontal so it is built

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,070
in with sharding and a whole bunch of

00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:51,200
other stuff and you can do commands that

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,389
just say Shaarawy and it goes in shards

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,789
but I don't know how reliable those are

00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:56,150
the did you ever have any problems with

00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:58,190
that

00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,630
openshift clusters or anything with the

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,270
sharding did we ever do sharding or

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:06,800
anything like that does anybody know now

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:12,700
okay so that's it for any

00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:16,460
questions about we're all good yes

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,560
okay now some spatial so this is like

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,870
you know in the world the spatial phone

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,040
functionality currently has is

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:28,010
very simplistic there's near so tell me

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,780
things that are near me right here's a

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,240
point what's near this point this is a

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:37,700
line show me other points or lines that

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:40,910
are near this line right containment so

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,730
containment says this is the city

00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,380
boundaries of Brno show me all the

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,120
restaurants in the city boundaries of

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:53,030
bernal show me all the post office codes

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,550
that are in and their areas that are

00:20:53,030 --> 00:21:01,370
inside the city of Brno so we're to get

00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:02,720
within right so closely with containment

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,530
though if it has to be completely

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,230
contained what you can also do is

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:12,020
intersection so an intersection says are

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,810
you within or do you cross the boundary

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,870
of all right so this is saying show me

00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:20,150
any postal code that may actually

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:23,120
intersect those city limits of Brno

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,680
boundary but for those of you who've you

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,870
well there's only one person here who's

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:32,030
used a spatial database right in you'll

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:35,510
grow this is not and you guys were to

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,010
push GIS it's horrible spatial I'm

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,140
postgres and it basically is like a

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,330
complete GIS system and you can do all

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,250
sorts of really fancy modeling things

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,750
like buffering so you could say take all

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,700
the restaurants but for 10 meters

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,010
intersect that with all the rail lines

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,600
and show me all the rail lines that are

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,350
actually closed all the pieces of the

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,809
rail lines there

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,320
close to restaurants you cannot do that

00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:59,059
here right because you can only you

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,059
could say show me all the restaurants

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:04,190
that are within 10 miles of this rail

00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:06,770
line or all rail lines but you can't

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,570
actually then say give me back those

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:12,530
pieces of the rail line that are exactly

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,260
there does that make sense so it's

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,270
really about query it is all it is you

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,880
cannot do spatial operations you can

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,559
just query in MongoDB but what that

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,809
turns out to be is that for most that's

00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,059
about 70 maybe sixty percent of the

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,990
spatial use cases most people and

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,340
they're thinking about doing something

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,650
speacial it's what's called pins on a

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,000
map right I put a bunch of pins on the

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,100
map and I want to find things near the

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,510
pins or something like that right most

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,130
of us don't do complex spatial

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,740
operations so this actually worked great

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,419
for this because I said this is up an

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,440
online you can go back and read more if

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:45,530
you want to read more about the details

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,620
later about how it all works okay like

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:52,429
their implementation everything there's

00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:55,640
two types of indices there's Judy for

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,500
flat surfaces and 2d sphere and this

00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,840
helps with coordinates on an earthlike

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,880
sphere right there is very different

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,830
calculations for distance and area and

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,240
all those things depending on whether

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,850
you're working on a flat surface or

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,630
you're working on a skier most of the

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:16,940
maps we look at our 2d but what comes

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:19,250
out of these things GPS coordinates

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,559
which are on a sphere latitude and

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,820
longitude with some particular datum I'm

00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,559
not going to talk about details today

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,200
because most of us won't actually use

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,549
code today but the idea is they have

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,200
built this so that when you're getting

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:33,350
GPS units you can do really good

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,500
distance calculations right where we are

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:39,289
here and within all that stuff this can

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:43,309
be any arbitrary 2d surface so we could

00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:44,990
actually map out this room get

00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,210
coordinates for everybody's position

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,610
relative to that corner or that corner

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,100
so everybody would have a position and

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:55,250
then we could say who is the closest

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,679
person sitting next to mark right it

00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,419
would probably the guy in front right

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,370
but while we can take find all the

00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:03,559
people sitting within 10 meters of mark

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:06,169
or 10 units

00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:07,940
whatever we choose to map the rumen so

00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,159
people can also you could use this for

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,980
things like electronic sports your

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,600
backyard or if you get data from that

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,879
it's already been projected and I'm not

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,269
going to talk too much more about that

00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:24,740
so good to know it handles toj saw

00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:30,289
natively so goj some is the JSON

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:32,360
standard for handling geodata okay and

00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:34,850
it has a particular format and if you

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,220
work with latitude and longitude data

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:41,629
and you're going to do 2d sphere you

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:43,999
have to do Geo JSON okay you don't have

00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:46,759
to do it for 2d but for 2d sphere it's

00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:49,610
got to be in goj song and it'll hit by

00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:53,269
doing that though and what are the units

00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:56,419
on here like one of them units what are

00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:59,980
the units for a position degrees right

00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,980
did you get did you get a scarf yet

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:07,369
people are stealing my thunder okay so

00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:08,960
if its degree so if I asked you how far

00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:10,909
is point one degrees from where I'm

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,259
standing right now how many of you would

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:17,119
be able to figure out when you got to

00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:18,679
about point 1 degrees independent it

00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,350
also would depend where we are the

00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,850
sphere II right it's arbitrary depending

00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,269
on whether you're close to the equator

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:28,519
or close to the pole so that makes

00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:30,799
calculations and how put very hard if

00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:34,129
you're just dealing with these things if

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,480
you put it in an angio JSON Magos smart

00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:37,490
enough to give you the unit's back in

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,159
either meters or feet depending on what

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:45,289
you want rather than back in units of

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:46,610
degrees over two meters sorry it is

00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:48,590
student when you're making the spatial

00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,350
index it as soon as the coordinates are

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,299
between minus 180 and up to 180 why is

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,340
that somebody new who needs a scarf gets

00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:56,840
a first chance at ask why do you think

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:01,700
they made the index range by default

00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:03,529
that somebody needs a scarf someone you

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,860
already have one too just somebody to

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:08,509
not have a scarf okay so we want to do

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,560
one of you want to answer I'll be nice

00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:11,810
why do you think

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,570
x is if you just even talk and give a

00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,160
guess as to why you'll get a scarf why

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,240
do you think they chose this range for

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,300
the index think about a globe exactly

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,040
it's because the maximum degrees you can

00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,400
ever get on the globe of the earth is

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,220
180 degrees either east or west of the

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,070
prime meridian right so if we actually

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,800
did that to ye with the room and we were

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,500
using centimeter accuracy it's much more

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,180
than 180 centimeters to do map out the

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,830
whole room in each direction when you

00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,230
make the index you have to pass in the

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,060
new range for the index okay and then

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,160
just because the only person I don't

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,080
want you going home without a star I'm

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,370
just going to give you one anyway just

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,620
for raising your hands that you didn't

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,000
have a scarf mattered what I don't need

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:01,580
some scarves for tonight's session

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:05,570
please have a scar but not everybody is

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:09,320
star you don't are you staying for the

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:13,670
next session okay well you better stay

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,950
if you want to stop and also there's

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,660
also a formula to convert to human

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,490
readable units that you keep it in lat

00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,230
long right it's called the Hydra time

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,970
formula and that's actually helps you

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,580
convert from right long two feet and

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,080
meters so how do you make it work so

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,340
this is the part where the only person

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,450
who is going to appreciate how simple

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,760
this is is the guy who's worked with

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:37,430
Oracle spatial before because it's

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:40,370
incredibly simple to make it work so you

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:44,060
eat if you're using you either make you

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,440
make a field in your JSON right so this

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,560
is location and those are the

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,200
coordinates this is for 2d if you're

00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,880
going to put it in if you're going to do

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
if you use mods you longitude with a

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,820
default index make sure to put it in

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,110
longitude latitude first because that's

00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:01,340
geo gay son that's geo JSON format all

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,800
right this is just straight you just

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,780
made it location 50 30 I think brand is

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,460
that what we did in our example you just

00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,260
use the straight field like that map goj

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,610
something right we should have used a

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,860
JSON so we're not showing you best

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,810
practices in the example we're going to

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,570
use G this is geo JSON it's very similar

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,840
there's a field location it's got an

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,300
ashen saturday which

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,160
type is point coordinate and then an

00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,730
array of the court heads with longitude

00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,440
and latitude first we may have okay this

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,670
will see later everybody will be we have

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,680
the source code everybody will get to

00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,990
look so that's that you just put your

00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,960
data in and remember yeah we did it

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:39,210
right I love when we're good um so with

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,500
this do you remember you have to declare

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,660
any of these fields beforehand there's

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,550
no DD l during which is part of the part

00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:48,710
that's really annoying and Oracle

00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:52,230
spatial and then after you've done that

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,680
you just say DB your collection which is

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,450
your table and you sure index would pick

00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,290
whatever field has the coordinates in it

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:04,530
and say 2d sphere and it indexes the

00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:07,620
data with a 2d speeder index and you're

00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:10,710
done your data is not spatial so put

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:14,250
your data in make an index on it and

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,800
you're done that is probably the easiest

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:20,400
way ever to get spatial data in am i

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,800
right compared to Oracle spatial yes

00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,410
thank you I know you were to say yes but

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,970
you you get so what they trade it is

00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:32,310
ease of use for power and flexibility

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:34,080
right this is very easy to use but it

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,080
becomes much harder to use if you move

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,690
any way off the normal use case and you

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,880
don't get what you normally want to do

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:44,010
or you can make a 2d index which is DVD

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,150
places entry index the field and just to

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:51,420
be okay and that's it and you're done so

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,890
are now I'm going to switch to je e for

00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,930
those of you who are not java developers

00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,390
you can kind of pay attention we're

00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:59,160
going to go through the code later or

00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:03,180
fewer java developer how do you use

00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:08,210
jax-rs are there any java developers

00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:11,370
who've not used jax-rs you haven't I

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,370
okay I wouldn't consider myself a job

00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,510
over even though I developed some small

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,240
blaze in Java it's not your main

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,350
language how about CDI of all those I'm

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,760
not counting you anymore you can keep

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,680
your hand out but those are you actually

00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,890
written like java web applications how

00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,230
many of you have you not used CDI you've

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,460
not used to contend ok context

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,040
dependency injection I'm not going to go

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,110
do it in a book it is booked two is

00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,420
actually it now there's an annotation in

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,620
the new Java EE where you can just see

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,770
the eyes up and I'll show it to you

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:43,470
later jax-rs I'll tell you what it is

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,090
jacks are has is the anti soap which is

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,490
what java was known for four though ever

00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:50,040
if the anti-soviet to the rest making

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,330
rest interfaces and it's super duper

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,429
easy to make it like when i actually

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,340
started using it I almost felt as hip as

00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:58,650
lion or no jayesh developer like I was

00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,910
like up I'm almost as good as him and I

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,520
mean I don't have the Hat and the beard

00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,320
yet but I'm working on it so it

00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,120
basically do a bunch of annotations and

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,160
you can expose the URL and you actually

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,620
can do all the serialization and

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,880
deserialization automatically on the fly

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,570
and we'll see it later so that's it for

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,400
the jax-rs leap with so we've handled

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,750
the data store we've handled the app

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,640
server and how we're actually going to

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,350
do our business lodger leaflet is what

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,220
goes on the front end to handle maps

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,320
okay and so a quick intro it's a light

00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,059
weight very very lightweight Jim

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,470
JavaScript client side of library for

00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:34,110
doing great max there's a couple

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,760
different JavaScript libraries the other

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,700
big one compared to this one is called

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,309
openlayers openlayers comes more out of

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,020
the GIS world wherever is used for like

00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,820
if you need things like an editing

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,170
toolbar if you want to edit features on

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,610
the map and you want to do that stuff

00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,610
you're going to be looking at openlayers

00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:54,690
leaflet is much more for that people who

00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,210
want to do pins on map or heat maps and

00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,679
quick lightweight JavaScript on top it

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,020
came out later than openlayers which is

00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,270
to its benefit it works out of the box

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,800
with openstreetmap as well as others but

00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,330
do you guys know any liquid street map

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,890
is who doesn't know what open I'm in

00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,500
Europe I always assume people do know it

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,000
open street map is here there's one guy

00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,140
shaking his head so that means that the

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,559
rest of you don't know what

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,090
openstreetmap is correct you do because

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,580
you've done the sample

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:26,279
you expect people you meet so the reason

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,409
I want to keep you it's actually the

00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,240
community here even though you guys

00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:32,580
probably have less people overall than

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,169
all of the United States you have where

00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,330
especially if you just probably in

00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,279
Germany alone there is more contributors

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,350
than there is in all of the United

00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,750
States it came out of the guy who

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:45,360
started each coast was in England and

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,590
then some companies have some countries

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,350
have really got on board it's the

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,659
Wikipedia of Max basically people go out

00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,100
with their GPS in their phone or though

00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,529
when it was first started was Jean

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,380
little handheld GPS units would store a

00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:01,080
track and then come back put it up into

00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,700
the OpenStreetMap write the name on it

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,720
and then you want a map of the world

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:10,110
well that's somebody or something here

00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:12,179
this gave it up all nice Peter not when

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,039
they started them so when open stream I

00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:16,020
first started it was very much this hey

00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:18,149
then gained enough momentum from people

00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,799
doing things that now we have a

00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:21,419
government agencies just getting their

00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,450
data when there is this open data giving

00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,429
it to openstreetmap so it's and it's

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,740
free for anybody to download and use and

00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:30,450
you can go in and edit it if you want to

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,159
so there's a lot of interesting use

00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:35,190
cases for this one is a new clipper back

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,919
in the states actually hired someone to

00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,980
go out for every story and put a point

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,840
in OpenStreetMap where that story took

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,640
place so then the newspaper could

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,220
actually link back that story and have

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,940
people look at that location on a map

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,130
right and they were free to do that

00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,929
because it's an open database the other

00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,500
thing that this is really good for is

00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:57,090
humanitarian arrows Organa therrien

00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,480
catastrophes so like do you know what

00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:02,580
was the latest the tsunami in the

00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,710
tsunami in Thailand basically there's

00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,730
there's no maps of really good maps of

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,649
all the back or the ones that just

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,690
happened in Nepal the earthquake in

00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:11,159
Nepal they put out a call for people to

00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,540
map they divided it up and people just

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,760
go in and start mapping all the roads

00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,300
and basically within a week that entire

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,250
country is mapped just on volunteers so

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,800
if you're just going to put pins on a

00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,119
map it's probably the best data layer

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,849
out there because then you're not tied

00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,470
to putting things into goo right if

00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,700
you're just putting pins on that

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,980
if you're going to be in Germany you can

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,450
actually even do routing with it to

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,399
route Paris Germans have put enough

00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:38,310
effort in to like have turn restrictions

00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,780
and speed limits and all that stuff most

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,369
other countries in the wind check has to

00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,929
yeah most other countries in the world

00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:45,379
like the United States I wouldn't use it

00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,970
for routing except for bikes and walking

00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:50,250
okay and you still might tell you to

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,830
walk off of a on ramp or something like

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,020
that to the road down below and leaflets

00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,520
mobile-ready you can see today when you

00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,560
spin up your app you can go to the URLs

00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,170
with your phone into work it has a rich

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,750
library of plugins so it has things like

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,070
heat maps so everybody know that heat

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,540
map is it's like when you have different

00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,210
colors on the map depending on the

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,690
intensity of stuff so if you have points

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,580
with values in them you can use the heat

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,680
map plugin to change that into a heat

00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,900
map surface rather than a bunch of

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,840
points with different colors which is

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,300
sometimes better for visualization ok so

00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,220
that's it for the slides that's all the

00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,500
chap we're going to use today anybody

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,849
have any other questions I'm assuming

00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,200
you'll have questions as we start to do

00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,609
this and we start digging and looking at

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:38,270
source code but if there's any others

00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:38,270
right now go ahead go forward yeah

00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:48,000
compared to clouded I haven't used

00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:50,849
clouded so I don't know is it very

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,240
similar it's also very similar cap space

00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:57,510
or CouchDB right they're both very

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,480
similar you know it depends on as if

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,369
some of it is religious where people get

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,140
in their head that this is there this is

00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:07,109
the right thing and you must use it I

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,300
think mangu is very popular for what it

00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:12,990
has become less and less popular over

00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,820
time later they believe performance

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,380
trade-offs light performance trade-offs

00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,869
summer so like one example is between

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,030
couch TV and CouchDB you have to

00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:23,099
predefine all of your indexes you can't

00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,900
make indexes on the fly right so you

00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,700
can't do queries off a random data at

00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,230
least it used to be encashed EV you

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,250
couldn't just arbitrarily query your

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:34,320
document and Mambo you could but CouchDB

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,079
actually started up an HTTP server so

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,190
any queries to it were just fatal rest

00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,729
right so out of the box you can already

00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:45,339
serve up your data alright so now that's

00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:46,749
any other questions so I don't know the

00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:48,729
exact you're going to have to look for

00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:51,009
some blog post or some article it talks

00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:52,690
about document data stores and

00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,970
performance benefits everybody ready

00:36:52,690 --> 00:37:01,180
who's going to actually do the exercises

00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:04,210
or try only four people five people okay

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,309
ready for the rest of you you can just

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,309
watch me because I'll do all the

00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:10,509
exercises to UM for the revenue on your

00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:12,099
lap that doesn't mean you get to do

00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:13,809
YouTube and all those other things

00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,119
though okay if you're not following

00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:19,749
along open this repo this is the rican

00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,190
hungry but we're going to use marker you

00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:26,529
can use this one later to in the next

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:28,210
session of you freaking bugs okay it

00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:29,920
you're going to do more accession later

00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,960
are you going to show web books if

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,549
you're going to use mark accession go

00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,869
ahead and actually any of you get hub

00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:37,089
before it I don't have to explain it all

00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,829
to you go ahead and fork this and make

00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:41,380
your own repo and then used to use that

00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:42,789
URL instead if you're not going to be in

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,859
more extension later which I feel bad

00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:47,349
for you that you're not go ahead and

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:50,559
just use this one open it up and then

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,460
also open the web console here this is

00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,660
the incidents that you're going to use

00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,799
if you're going to do the exercise

00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:57,130
please raise your hand I have to give

00:37:53,799 --> 00:38:03,359
you a number okay raise it high until I

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:07,660
give you a number user 0 1 user 02 03 04

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,739
05 06 you want to do it you're kind of

00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,969
jealous of these other people are going

00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:16,960
to go home with working apps and you're

00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:20,349
done here 07 anyone else actually 15

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,180
sort of 50 yeah what you know does this

00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,559
think about like time is kind of linear

00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,059
in our conception and if you had

00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,940
actually told that to be before I

00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:29,890
started there may be possibility that

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:34,839
this already you will also have to make

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:40,930
a new project good okay I'm going to go

00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:45,670
into 00 all right so I don't need my

00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:49,630
sloth keep forgetting that I'm not so

00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:51,309
here's the g shipley open chip okay I'm

00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,869
to start firing up the app with you guys

00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:54,279
and then we'll come back and look at the

00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:56,170
source code because it's going to take a

00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:57,819
little while for things to get going so

00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,609
here we are everybody should be looking

00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:03,700
at something like this I want those who

00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:05,319
are following along to put log in and it

00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,509
was def def comp is the password for

00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:10,599
everybody so the password for everybody

00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:14,109
all lower case we care about security a

00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:16,990
lot and the password for everybody dad

00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:19,089
Tom so don't have each other's accounts

00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,710
there's no competition here it's not

00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:25,740
that giving you do there's no best in

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,740
app ok so please be nice to each other

00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:33,130
so the Ulf does everybody get that URL

00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:34,509
to the web console that's not my

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,960
presentation where to go what's over

00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:40,650
here again if you thought you want the

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,390
app you want the link for the slides I

00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:45,369
was up there too yeah that's so much to

00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,529
type it's really easy to click on the

00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:50,759
link so let me just go back to the first

00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:50,759
page of the slide back

00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:02,170
this is probably easier for you to type

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:08,560
in talks about the speed 0 that's a zero

00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:14,200
com je e map v3 and then go to the

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:20,260
slides that has the links to the various

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:22,270
places he grant since you failed to tell

00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,460
me anything in a proper work and I asked

00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:29,470
your favorite piece if you give me a

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:32,890
glass of water I don't want any bullet I

00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:35,770
like to fold it come on you know goes me

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,120
busy just anything to go okay that's

00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,590
great fizzy water sounds great thank you

00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,640
it doesn't have to be AI thought that

00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:45,430
would be harder oh you can tell me the

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:50,200
bulk of the team is no just get me one

00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:52,030
too even say that please so everybody

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,150
got on the link can I go back to the

00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:56,860
exercise now does anybody not have the

00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,840
link that's I should just ask negatives

00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:03,250
does it may not have the link okay I'm

00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:05,860
going back okay so go here your login is

00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:11,430
use your user whatever at whatever I

00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:17,770
still don't have the this look inside is

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:19,690
a little less melissa's local Wi-Fi the

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:23,860
Wi-Fi is fine for other people everybody

00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:27,250
else is it really quick and fine save

00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:29,320
for certain people okay move them say

00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:33,160
that's good you're using a Mac actually

00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:37,480
some excellent hey never worked but it

00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:41,160
works in working for everybody else who

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,450
still really but Harrison doesn't count

00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:48,010
I'm just going to go forward very slowly

00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:49,390
then user 0 0 or whatever use your you

00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,040
are is very well please decided they

00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:55,180
want to follow along since it's going so

00:41:51,040 --> 00:42:00,850
well okay and then the password is dev

00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:03,550
conf enter and you're in and you should

00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:08,190
see something that looks like this is

00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:10,829
that what you are seeing yes and we're

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:13,200
all thank you very much and then we're

00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:15,060
going to make a new project because

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,160
there is already the MLB parks in here

00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,829
if there is one in yours we're going to

00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,810
make it up in the top right there is

00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:24,690
this blue button that says new project

00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:26,880
click on it and you're going to name it

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,760
you can name it whatever you want i

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:34,349
don't care i'm going to name mine grant

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,390
is rude and then you can put in a

00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:42,300
display name or and then i'm going to my

00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:47,970
display name is grant was raised by

00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:50,670
wolves and then that day okay and you

00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,750
take great and you should be looking at

00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:55,910
something like this is this what

00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,910
everybody's looking at is still waiting

00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,970
get ready mark are you hearing I'm he

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,990
still waiting to login he's still

00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:09,480
waiting to login are you still waiting

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:12,359
to log into what can you stop and then

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,240
restart try reload and doesn't like 75

00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:20,849
times and it hasn't still hasn't changed

00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:22,680
a thing no difference okay 80 is the

00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,300
server actually slow I got that back up

00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:29,880
its useful life it's just the wide

00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:31,440
variance this ever since okay no I think

00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,630
it's wife every person working even

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,460
afford edit the presentation to load as

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,839
well and I just on certain people's

00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,880
machines and I don't know how that ends

00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:40,980
up like I'll get disconnected and come

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,300
back and whatever so sorry you can

00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,829
follow along I'm going to keep going

00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,859
because I got to keep going there are

00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:48,390
some see chakra people going in selling

00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:49,980
stuff they probably have viruses all on

00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:53,310
your machine okay so the thing that

00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,230
you're going to search for here is we're

00:43:53,310 --> 00:44:01,050
going to search for in the filter by

00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:04,980
keyword you're going to do e AP right

00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:07,020
and you're going to pick let's see as

00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,260
any grant have you tried it with one dot

00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,260
to

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,120
we're going to we're going to all be

00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:20,750
guinea pigs we're going to pick jboss

00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,840
EAP open shifts one two so this is a

00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,460
docker image built by the S the stl and

00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,370
the developer experience even open shift

00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,980
so its fullest reported its EAP 64 and

00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:32,720
the version of it is one got to actually

00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,690
pull about James it was built by the

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,710
jboss team not the SEL team so SEL team

00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:41,300
you can stop looking so smug what

00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:42,800
exactly this is filled by the jboss this

00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,490
is nobody like build the cost of his

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,160
team I guess so we'll say yes so go

00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,930
ahead and click that so then the name

00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,900
this is going to be in the name of your

00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,190
application right over the name of your

00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,050
product if it's going to create a label

00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,130
I'm not talking about those right now

00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,260
because all we're trying to do is bring

00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,780
up the spatial app so the name for this

00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:05,780
will be mapi you can call it whatever

00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:08,510
you want map map that's my name in my

00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:13,100
map it's nothing that map and the git

00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:16,160
repository URL is the is this one right

00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:18,080
here you can use the one up atop but

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,930
i'll use me you want to give me your

00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:26,380
copying grants git repository if you

00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:33,110
forked it use your URL instead ok and

00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:36,110
then paste that it be here everybody got

00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:41,120
that for those who've actually can get

00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:45,140
to the page ok and then say create and

00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:47,360
that's all you have to do and so what we

00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,000
have done that image that we were

00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:53,150
talking about the docker image is

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,700
actually a builder image so it has the

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:59,120
functionality inside of it to say I'm

00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:03,170
eate but I also know how to build if you

00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,970
give me a pom.xml and so what we did is

00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,640
we gave it a git repo that has a palm

00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,620
dot XML on the base of it and now what's

00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,230
happening behind the scenes is this

00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,090
image the IMP the original image is

00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,730
pulling in that source code in a tar

00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:18,920
ball into the temp directory unzip on

00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,369
tour again and then proceeding to run

00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,569
maven build against it

00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:25,559
and then when it's finished it's going

00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:27,839
to push it into the EAP deploy location

00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,970
and then save that out as a new docker

00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,180
image and push it into our registry all

00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:35,940
behind the scenes so if I say it quickiy

00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,829
quickly and simply is taking source code

00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,279
in a docker image and creating a new

00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:42,960
diaper image that we can run right with

00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:46,230
the source code in it and that's what

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,499
we're doing right there okay and this is

00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:53,190
the step that actually takes the longest

00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:56,160
so if we go back to the overview you can

00:46:53,190 --> 00:47:05,670
see that we have it built running you

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:08,670
can click on your bill right and we can

00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:13,440
actually look at the logs this is new in

00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:17,249
31 of openshift 311 or just 31 we wanted

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,140
this before men you have before 31 you

00:47:17,249 --> 00:47:21,210
actually had a ssh into your builder

00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,519
bottom look at the log files there now

00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,920
we can watch the bill happening so for

00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,140
those of you are a job at direct a job

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,130
of people please explain to the non Java

00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:34,589
people what we're waiting for right now

00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:35,640
what does this look like to you you

00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:37,319
don't get you don't have to answer I'm

00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,519
not considering you on the hook come on

00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:41,460
some of you said you were Java

00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:43,529
developers you used me even right that's

00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,059
linear some pic inches from mainland

00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:47,519
building yeah it's pulling me an

00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:49,710
internet using maven and I'm not sure

00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,900
about the food exactly this is basically

00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:55,440
made in downloading the entire internet

00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,789
and putting it into our image okay so

00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,859
we're going to that's why i said i'm

00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:04,499
going to start this first because this

00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:08,869
is going to take a while mine's not done

00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:11,809
whose is done is mine done

00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:14,509
or you're pushing server you're watching

00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:16,220
me or you like the creepy sysadmin that

00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:19,670
goes into everybody's project and mix it

00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:21,589
stuff okay so then once it did that

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,019
building we in open ship we run an

00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:28,099
internal docker registry right and so

00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:30,109
when that image was built right where

00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:33,470
did it do this there are with the

00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:35,930
building being done and it's pushing

00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:38,089
here into our eternal death resulting

00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:42,170
docker image in your doctor registry and

00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:47,569
so now if we go back and we look there

00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:50,499
are project overview again we should you

00:48:47,569 --> 00:48:53,480
know I of it yak about I have another

00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:58,099
feature request although there it is

00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:01,430
it's on the right side go to the top you

00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:04,549
can go to overview again then you can

00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:06,740
see we've actually this hasn't scaled up

00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:09,019
here so we've got a pod now running the

00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,519
build is done we can actually go to the

00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:16,460
deployment so go to browse deployments

00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:18,410
everybody see that left side browse

00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,329
deployment so we built a docker image

00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:22,220
and now we've moved into the fleet the

00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:25,039
phase of deploying that docker image

00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:27,890
into the infrastructure if you don't

00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,480
have your own run if you don't have your

00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:31,789
own bill cycle you could actually just

00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:37,519
deploy a straight docker image so here's

00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:40,849
the deployment is it done it's creates

00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:43,390
running so let's look at that and we can

00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:43,390
look at the logs

00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,579
so it looks like it actually looks like

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,869
it's deployed it and it's actually now

00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:59,519
doing a readiness check is that correct

00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:02,970
is it is that what is that what it says

00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:05,880
it's doing here yeah thank you that's

00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:08,220
what me is a developer I understand that

00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,710
it has deployed the docker image you can

00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,440
actually send a readiness hook for the

00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,390
docker image to say hey when I returned

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,849
success that means I'm actually ready to

00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:20,430
serve up responses for those of you who

00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:25,109
are java developers nephews EAP how long

00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:27,140
does it take for EAP to start up no

00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:29,759
matter what the middleware team tells me

00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,039
something it takes some time this is not

00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:41,519
starting Apache so we might actually be

00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:49,890
waiting but I don't know okay that makes

00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:52,440
playback oh my own laptop yeah they are

00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:56,250
turning it ever has anybody else is here

00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,170
turn blue in the audience there's a blue

00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:00,509
circle around it so yours is working you

00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:03,269
may find that the push times out it hit

00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:05,369
me during mine awesome so for those of

00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:07,410
you who are ready blue you can click on

00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:10,019
this link that's up on top that's your

00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:12,930
URL to your app we created a route to it

00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:16,799
and you should see a map with no pins on

00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:20,339
is that true isn't it awesome you

00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:22,140
wait got Mac I don't know if mines

00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:23,220
actually I maybe I should just I have to

00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,349
wait for it to die or should I just

00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:28,680
deploy it again yeah and like you can do

00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:30,450
this oily no you will not show me the

00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,339
other day again this is browse deployed

00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,890
go back to my deploy and fire up another

00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:38,279
deployment just just do that zeros

00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,869
feeling too long you say in Vietnam oh

00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:43,799
that's a good pattern see this is why we

00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:46,170
like having the dev see ya scale down so

00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:49,710
when I scale 20 that says get rid of

00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,210
anything that's running right now Wayne

00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:54,089
always hid he's not messing around with

00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:58,250
mine it's to push up to build its tiny

00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:58,250
you what did you do

00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,820
the subject it's a cruise ship to built

00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,800
it is climbing out which means you

00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:07,320
actually got a Reaper till I'm out and

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,790
rebuild rebuild it's really not you did

00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:15,150
make sure to scale down so it would

00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:19,680
appear but it's still saying it's

00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:23,340
scaling 20 yeah I thought it was using

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:29,190
WebSockets we're out yahoo you're the

00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:31,100
worst mascot ever okay I'll be pushed

00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:34,370
and it's still saying I had one pot I

00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:37,650
eyebrows deployments and start a new one

00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:39,510
that's worth me in the past okay so

00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:43,830
there's my deployment cuz it's right in

00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:47,850
it and I'm just going to say no not i'm

00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:50,400
not going to delete it okay usually you

00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:55,920
could click there and let me see if I

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:58,830
can kill this one can edit it where's

00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,620
the stop button this log very well

00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:06,900
there's logs if you want to do inspo red

00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:10,670
X to the road just take a good sad says

00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:14,850
cancel rather than stop okay giacobbe

00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:28,860
another issue no not canceled its stop

00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:30,600
the deployment rollback kill it okay

00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,310
anyway i'm going to try it again this

00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,290
part actually what it works is actually

00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,670
quite fast because all it's doing is

00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,800
reading out of the dr registry and

00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:42,930
deploying a DA privilege the part is

00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:44,550
when it works now so that's the old one

00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:51,210
that we cancelled no this is the one

00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:53,250
that we canceled it's yellow it's kind

00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,010
of hard for me to show the demo of mine

00:53:53,250 --> 00:54:00,240
doesn't work I'm glad the engineers are

00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:02,299
here Mike left before this right of

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,509
course he did

00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:06,829
but anybody else's don't turn blue or is

00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:08,839
it your are you facing the same issue

00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:10,479
item so just don't do anything yet until

00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:15,939
we figure out how I'm going to fix money

00:54:10,479 --> 00:54:19,579
what yours is up okay anybody else is up

00:54:15,939 --> 00:54:22,609
who's not up meet you and me and you

00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:25,640
take miss you know I'm in front of you

00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:28,869
the guy with the eye glasses you got if

00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,869
you're not as up in it looks like mine

00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:36,049
your page is refreshing awesome ok so

00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:40,059
I'm going to I'm going to walk you guys

00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:42,199
I don't want you guys to wait for now

00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:45,699
you can I give you permission to do

00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:45,699
whatever you need to do to make my work

00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:56,630
looking looking doesn't really help so

00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:58,969
much I need you to fix it the exactly

00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,549
should I just do i just read it anyway I

00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:05,019
want to keep you guys going alright so

00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:07,189
the next thing that we're going to do is

00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:11,839
we're going to actually and I can do

00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:13,729
this hopefully the next thing I'm going

00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,439
to do is I'm actually going to go back

00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:17,089
to i'm going to click on the top right

00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:18,289
for those who've actually have it

00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:19,339
working you're going to click on the top

00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:31,089
right you're going to say add the

00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:31,089
project and you're going to say

00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:38,140
and we're going to for today we're going

00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:41,049
to pick MongoDB ephemeral so what this

00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,119
means is it's do you know about

00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:44,829
persistent volume claims in open ships

00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,009
everybody kind of do about open shift

00:55:44,829 --> 00:55:50,230
okay we're using credit under the hood

00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:52,299
in Coober Nettie's the systems

00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,249
administrator makes volumes accessible

00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:56,079
to the developers that's called a

00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:58,480
persistent volume when you spend

00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:02,319
something up you can ask for a

00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,960
persistent volume that claim when you

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:06,670
say ephemeral that says make a claim to

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,269
the disk space running in the docker

00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:12,220
image docker images are immutable so if

00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:14,019
that image goes down any data that you

00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:17,529
make pack stored in the ephemeral one

00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:19,029
will go away if I said persistent it

00:56:17,529 --> 00:56:20,410
would actually attached to one of the

00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:22,900
persistent volumes that are available

00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,700
and store the data there for today we're

00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,829
just going to store our data inside the

00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,450
docker image so if your doctor image

00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:33,009
dies when you restarted the data will go

00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:36,809
away okay so click MongoDB ephemeral you

00:56:33,009 --> 00:56:36,809
can grant what did you name the service

00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:44,789
so the database schema name is service

00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:47,589
name is mov parks okay so are you sure

00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:49,299
I'd leave the services I think this i

00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:59,130
think the service name is DB gran

00:56:49,299 --> 00:56:59,130
I like grant was raised by wolves though

00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:10,269
so here's all of your grants yeah just

00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:14,589
called MongoDB okay so you're just going

00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:16,029
to leave that name alone on grant was

00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:19,809
raised by wolves or whatever you name

00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:23,559
yours oh it's running did you fix it or

00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:30,569
did you just do it automatically I just

00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:33,759
gonna go okay fixed itself and

00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:35,890
well feeling nice we did that on purpose

00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:37,960
to show the self healing properties are

00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:41,829
open ship through okay so leave it as

00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,509
mongodb we're gonna have it generate no

00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:45,970
I great did you set the username and

00:57:43,509 --> 00:57:56,229
password no okay so then just leave it

00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:58,769
alone the user with MLB parts so

00:57:56,229 --> 00:58:02,819
change the username to MLB parks

00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:05,829
remember what the password was MLB parks

00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:10,539
the database is going to be MLB parts as

00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:12,309
well what Oh doesn't matter because it

00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:15,220
will make a database on the fly the

00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:16,960
admin password doesn't matter let it

00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,640
generate it if it's empty so if this is

00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,309
using the JSON template behind the

00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,609
scenes and so what you notice how this

00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:26,710
is generated is empty it says I can fill

00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:30,729
this in and provide it everything is MLB

00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:33,069
parks once you go to the next page this

00:58:30,729 --> 00:58:38,200
is renamed MongoDB everything else is

00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:40,210
MLB parts and you don't have to worry

00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,920
about the administrator password that

00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:43,299
will actually generate some random

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,650
password that we don't actually care

00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:46,690
about because we're not going to use it

00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:52,329
but for everything else is going to fill

00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:53,859
those values in right and we don't do

00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:57,099
anything with the labels so go ahead and

00:58:53,859 --> 00:59:02,289
say create so if we continue back to the

00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:08,609
overview again how do we get rid of this

00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:08,609
one you could delete

00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,950
it's not the leader so you should see

00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:18,170
this and this one should actually be

00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,550
relatively quick then composed by the

00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:25,640
time you get over there the blue should

00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:27,710
come up is that true anybody did it come

00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,300
up already for you since you're the one

00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,830
being the gray or you're the only one

00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,730
brave enough to answer usually did it

00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:39,760
already work for you yeah okay what

00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:42,710
happened Ryan could you check please

00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:47,480
okay so now we have a database

00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:52,010
running does anybody have that know what

00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:54,680
happened on yours yeah Americans way

00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:56,990
could be waiting for resources if

00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,260
there's already all deposits or

00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:02,720
allocated it's waiting for enough memory

01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,369
to give and that might be the case or

01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,750
the black is he waiting for the red it

01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:07,820
could be waiting for the docker image to

01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:11,230
get to the know that they're wrong yeah

01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:13,160
so the the other thing that happens here

01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:17,510
because we are the first ones really

01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:18,740
using this cluster what happens I don't

01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:20,960
know where to be preload this with all

01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,700
the docker images it should be

01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:31,160
pre-populated but I don't know what's

01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:33,780
going and I bet somebody scaled up like

01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,960
two or three hundred yeah

01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:40,770
the post-roman Angelo's is help every

01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:43,410
known dislike to pleasanton support so

01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:46,590
we have 15 gig of memory we have a sea

01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:50,040
views there no we have capacity of 100

01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:54,780
the poster nerve and on oh noes it's

01:00:50,040 --> 01:01:00,540
from 20 to 29 I've got a backup server

01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:04,650
as well okay so I'm just going to keep

01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:07,140
going forward sorry I apologize in

01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:10,110
advance for this so let's just keep

01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:12,240
going if I good for those who do have it

01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:14,280
up you going to be like the last man

01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,780
standing you should get like 30 i can't

01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,760
give you any more scarves i can give you

01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,560
like something else that has nothing to

01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,500
do with anything that you actually did

01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:25,230
but just because you got lucky so if i

01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:27,390
actually now go to this pod for the i

01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:31,920
have to actually change something though

01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:33,720
right what happened is automatic when

01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,510
this one gets restarted it's going to

01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:41,040
actually automatically pick up some

01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:43,620
environment variable names for the

01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,590
mongodb stuff what Cooper these does is

01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:48,420
for every service that comes up it

01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:50,460
automatically and all the other running

01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:54,150
pods will insert environment variables

01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:56,930
for the service what it will not insert

01:01:54,150 --> 01:02:01,860
though is the username and password

01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:03,350
right and so I now have to go into this

01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:06,350
is where i should bring up grants

01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,350
tutorial

01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:14,940
see it's somebody it's something about

01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:20,880
it on your laptop look at the internet

01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:22,260
because it's really fast here okay so

01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,450
here's what we're going to have to

01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:31,950
insert these environment variables in

01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:33,480
yeah this once the admin password

01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:37,920
doesn't matter them we're not going to

01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:41,400
use it oh ok oh no grammy do use it the

01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,980
map app uses it no I don't think the map

01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,540
uses it I don't think it does okay let's

01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,920
just try without it what we're going to

01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,840
have to do is insert these environment

01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,420
variables so when you want to insert

01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,460
environment variables into a service or

01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,160
a set of pods you need to do it at the

01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,870
deployment config so we're going to go

01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,590
ahead and do that now and the way we're

01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:08,340
going to do that is I'm going to go to

01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:09,390
my finally cleaned up I'll tell you

01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:11,370
where I'll show you up and up on the

01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:13,920
screen I promise to leave it before I

01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:17,520
sit save so we're going to go browse two

01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,290
deployments we're going to go to the MLB

01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,050
parks deployments because we need to put

01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:32,010
the usernames and passwords in available

01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:37,710
to the the Java code right and what

01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:43,350
we're going to do is edit do I really

01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:47,990
have to edit it raw or you could use a

01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:47,990
CLI yeah I know

01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,820
you're going to are going to need to

01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:54,090
make this bigger except it doesn't in

01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:56,500
Crete there is that good yeah mark

01:03:54,090 --> 01:04:00,160
different from another application will

01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:04,120
cement my neck man that was me this

01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:17,710
yours yeah yeah oh it works out yeah

know you should only have two

01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:13,090
deployments yeah pick the one that's not

01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:15,220
MongoDB all right okay it should have

01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:17,590
actually poke did you fork the repo and

01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:24,430
change the name or something uh no wife

the one is not MongoDB open that

01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:33,790
deployment then on the top right over

01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:42,070
here you'll see it three dots you see

01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:44,210
them click on that and say edit what now

01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:46,710
what I don't like the phone okay

01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:48,990
we're going to grab at it should open up

01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:51,089
some gamma file is everybody looking at

01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:55,579
a llamo file like this anyone else need

01:05:51,089 --> 01:06:00,030
help everybody's got a yellow fire okay

01:05:55,579 --> 01:06:04,440
you're going to scroll down in the ammo

01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:08,990
file until you see this env where it

01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:14,099
says like open shift cooping labels

01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:16,020
application equaled MLB parts and you

01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:17,520
scroll up just slightly so they know if

01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,010
they don't have an environment this

01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,630
should be part of the container spec it

01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:24,539
should be part you should see the look

01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:27,510
with a big long URL that I like this is

01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:30,020
the rib this is the doctor registry

01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:32,609
internal one and that's the docker image

01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:37,619
right keeps growing it should be passed

01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:38,880
back where it says ports it's always

01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,789
going to be in the exact same line

01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,190
number I all right I'd like to put money

01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:46,079
on that one it supposedly according to

01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:49,859
the engineers you should be able to get

01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:53,279
to line 61 and that should be the EMV is

01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:57,990
that true nice you owe me you're buying

01:06:53,279 --> 01:07:00,720
my xperia tomorrow is my Zen five we

01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:03,480
have a use for you it's a different

01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,520
label though you want these are not in

01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,220
the right names if you can find on

01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,809

01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,599
you change anything don't change

01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:14,970
anything going to change anything I have

01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:17,010
him adding a env section cuz he has no

01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:21,089
he at least section how does he have no

01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:24,839
env sectional commuter he didn't either

01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:28,529
MLB parks one or whatever it was I have

01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:31,170
this same man it says these just happen

01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:32,840
here's the command line tool I have the

01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,800
inscription

01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:40,230
but then they all have to download the

01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:42,950
command line tool okay the hands on part

01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:46,050
of this lab is officially now over

01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:48,390
you're going to watch me do it on the

01:07:46,050 --> 01:08:01,110
stream and be impressed by how smooth

01:07:48,390 --> 01:08:05,730
and easy it is okay everybody ready I'm

01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:07,860
gonna add some environment variables is

01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:11,130
that dash needed actually can just go

01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:13,020
there and yeah so he's actually all i

01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:15,570
sees you she's where they're on the hook

01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,480
yes of course right now let's take that

01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:21,450
big each other grated so you will meet

01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:25,910
hey what am I in grant was raised by

01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:30,120
wolves or it depends I'm in MLB parks

01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:32,310
this one that was my fault there's the

01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,830
stuff so there's my favorite of mine

01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:36,089
which is mapping that nap yours is

01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:45,600
called whatever i'm going to that

01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:52,680
deployment there that's it okay i don't

01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:58,200
know you yet we'll see edit the line

01:08:52,680 --> 01:09:01,190
should be no not yet not yet you're

01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:05,910
right there are absolutely no

01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:08,250
environment variables anywhere in it huh

01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:11,130
connect and you didn't have any i guess

01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:13,250
i took grants code and use grants code

01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:16,050
directly where did grants come from it I

01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:19,230
think he adds him in his he doesn't have

01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:22,230
that koo pink stuff and all that no no I

01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:24,930
saw one of those come from love this

01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:28,230
stuff hello my job that's propane so

01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:30,750
that's a Java template it's from a java

01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:33,089
application template ragatha we used as

01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,659
well but the java application simply

01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:36,169
doesn't

01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:43,109
that you need oh yeah yes Mara

01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:46,019
using a user higher than 10 and it works

01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:49,139
for you know uh i have the same problem

01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:50,849
like know that arise and then i'm going

01:09:49,139 --> 01:09:53,459
to be all the projects where you just

01:09:50,849 --> 01:09:55,739
stand and out but peanut the resources

01:09:53,459 --> 01:09:57,630
just to make sure okay because the

01:09:55,739 --> 01:10:02,639
online the hands-on portion of this demo

01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:04,139
is now over you can add envy yeah it's

01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:05,939
what you'd be right here right right if

01:10:04,139 --> 01:10:07,949
I'd put it right above ports and apps

01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:09,419
follow the same structure as ports yeah

01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:12,570
that's what I was thinking too so I'm

01:10:09,419 --> 01:10:16,579
going to do this and hit enter it put me

01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:16,579
in the wrong spot my finish better

01:10:18,169 --> 01:10:24,209
selling these things I had very much

01:10:20,789 --> 01:10:27,269
really I love this typing sexy it's yamo

01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:29,639
to write so indentation matters yeah do

01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:33,570
you see where my cursor is can I see my

01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:36,360
cursor Rocco okay you see where my

clitoris who now watch when i start

01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:43,769

01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:45,419
of bony showing as you know actively is

01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:47,309
now done so now i'm going to go to the

01:10:45,419 --> 01:10:48,900
ranch demo it's actually completely

01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:57,030
running and finishing i'll show you what

01:10:48,900 --> 01:11:04,349
was in there this is actually editing

01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:06,389
the llamo file just sorry okay because

01:11:04,349 --> 01:11:08,760
I'm have more time to my left can

01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:14,369
someone do a time check for me how much

01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:15,959
per kilo 30 okay if you guys want to

01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:17,939
follow along I think everybody has an

01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:20,729
MLB parks inside of their user is that

01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:22,360
true yeah grant do not take a picture of

01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:24,760
this

01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:28,119
so you know we're doing a panel tomorrow

01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,219
in the last session called so you want

01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:31,420
to be a developer evangelist and then

01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,530
you're probably going to ask you a

01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:37,530
question what was your most embarrassing

01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:37,530
moment on stage it will be in my top 3

01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:46,510
20 minutes ok so I'm going to go back to

01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:49,600
the overview I'm going to go back to the

01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:51,810
project called MLB parks this one's

01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:56,429
already John and it's running for you

01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:58,510
sorry for you yeah but everybody has it

01:11:56,429 --> 01:12:06,040
everybody should I think everybody has

01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:08,080
an MLB part ok keep watching the screen

01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:09,760
please you could jump right to

01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,429
deployment yeah I'm gonna go look at

01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,619
that now weird this is the deployment

01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:20,130
for MLB parks and there's going to be

01:12:14,619 --> 01:12:31,719
something if I actually look at it now

01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:40,480
there better be okay there you go how

01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:46,150
does it which one did he use he hasn't

01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:47,830
gone all the way through ok so what

01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:52,719
we're going to actually do here we're

01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:56,170
editing it the MongoDB user that is

01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:59,260
awesome I can't use the cut open it it's

01:12:56,170 --> 01:13:06,250
in Firefox should I try them something

01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:10,540
else you think clone you guys touch more

01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:12,909
in Chrome's and he should use my flower

01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:16,800
station I should you support Reggie's IE

01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:16,800
wears those bad neck guard houses

01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:36,460
what no no so there's a young fat so if

01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:39,270
we look at if we could hear our leader

01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:42,850
so easily if we go back to the mongodb

01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:47,949
llamo file right and I look at the if i

01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:49,150
look at the you should be in the

01:13:47,949 --> 01:13:52,420
application that was the one I was

01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:59,920
telling you to be in but if you look

01:13:52,420 --> 01:14:01,120
here is environment variables right does

01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,630
everybody see those environment

01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:09,719
variables mongodb 1 i've been to write a

01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,719
poem if you look in the mongodb one yeah

01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:15,429
and everybody was everywhere joseph this

01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:16,870
one he just he used the wrong ones that

01:14:15,429 --> 01:14:19,989
were generated he was the prophet in

01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:24,640
haste whoever did this ok but you'll see

01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:26,620
this has some environment variables if

01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,770
we have been able to do this properly

01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:35,080
and I was able to demo it I would have

01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:39,489
opened the terminal into the MLB Park

01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:43,420
spa all right so if i go to pods and i

01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:45,580
go to the MLB parks Bob and I go to the

01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:47,830
terminal and let me see if I can make

01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:55,050
this bigger can you guys see that now in

01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:57,969
the back yeah and I do en env crap

01:14:55,050 --> 01:15:00,489
if I had done this before I had set the

01:14:57,969 --> 01:15:02,440
environment variables in the application

01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:05,380
deployment config not in the database

01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,810
one but the application pieces the ones

01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:11,500
where it's see where it says you have

01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:13,570
everything like the path before the host

01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:17,050
but you wouldn't have the username in

01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:19,929
the password Kirby's handles put

01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:22,330
injecting the service IPS and ports and

01:15:19,929 --> 01:15:24,640
all that stuff but it has no concepts of

01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:27,460
usernames and passwords and all that so

01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:31,929
that is why we needed to go into the

01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:34,570
deployment convinces for the application

01:15:31,929 --> 01:15:35,940
and say hey you know what you need this

01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,830
environment variable

01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:39,420
username the passwords in the database

01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:42,810
we're going to put those into the

01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:46,140
deployment when we save those changes it

01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:48,719
would restart it would redeploy the pod

01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:50,040
for the application and then insert the

01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:56,660
environment variables the way it did

01:15:50,040 --> 01:16:00,690
here does that make sense kind of yeah

01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:02,610
we basic Cooper Nettie's can handle how

01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:04,469
things get plugged in together but it

01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:06,719
can't handle the pieces about usernames

01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:08,969
and passwords so we need to manually go

01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:11,520
in insert those and fiber barrels and

01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:22,980
restart the pod okay and then once you

01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:26,969
do that your application should look go

01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:33,770
back to the it's so there if I go back

01:16:26,969 --> 01:16:33,770
to the overview it should look like this

01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:41,010
how much time do we have left 15 minutes

01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:42,900
so I'll show I'll walk you through the

01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:45,239
code now which was the part I was

01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:47,640
supposed to do and this part is supposed

01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:48,780
to go incredibly smoothly and then we

01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:52,110
could have spent our time looking at

01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:58,380
what the code did okay so here if I go

01:16:52,110 --> 01:17:02,219
back to the greek oh ok so here i am in

01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:03,449
the git repo actually it turns out if

01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:06,210
you really want to do is to work right

01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:10,469
there's absolutely JSON file in the git

01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:15,020
repo this JSON file here this defines an

01:17:10,469 --> 01:17:18,300
entire application it defines the pods

01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:20,489
all right you guys you guys trying to

01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,710
fix it either whisper or wait until

01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:24,690
afterwards and fixing across I don't

01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:25,949
care right now no not you America I'm

01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:29,760
not talking about you you guys were

01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:31,940
funny so this actually is the same as

01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:36,449
that yeah mo except for the entire thing

01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:38,310
right so it defines the services it uses

01:17:36,449 --> 01:17:40,620
parameters for at the application name

01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:43,020
there's the route there's the image

01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:43,770
stream there's a bit configs it does all

01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:46,050
that stuff

01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:49,080
just run that JSON file and it would

01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:50,310
spit up that entire application so in

01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,540
the future that's something if you want

01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:54,090
to see the whole application working

01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:56,070
that's a good way to do okay now in

01:17:54,090 --> 01:18:01,530
terms of the code let's go ahead and

01:17:56,070 --> 01:18:03,720
look at the code so I'm going to start

01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:11,250
in the beginning which is the database

01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:14,430
and if I go into here you can see this

01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:16,350
is so this is using mom go actually had

01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:18,930
the Java driver for actually has

01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:20,310
its own connection pool I don't actually

01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:22,650
need to set up its own connection pool

01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:25,740
so basically all I'm doing here if I'm

01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:27,780
loading the bongo class once and then

01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:29,610
I'm going to inject it and I'm going to

01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:32,340
hold it in this in the application

01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:36,450
context and then use TDI to inject it

01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:40,140
whenever I need it okay so here after I

01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:41,700
create this object I'm actually loading

01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,080
up the usernames and passwords of the

01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:46,620
host if their advice if they're an

01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:50,270
environment variable I love them up if

01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:52,620
they're not I actually go ahead and said

01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,960
instruments on localhost everybody got

01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:57,060
that you see what I'm doing there there

01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,230
i'm basically from the container i'm

01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,790
going to say hey go give me these

01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:02,340
environment variable information i said

01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:05,310
it my code and then i basically go ahead

01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:07,670
and look basic here we are there's

01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:12,060
already mom go driver we've loaded it up

01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:14,160
it's in the scope of the object we get

01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:18,210
the DB we already knew the DB with MLB

01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:21,480
parks and this is the interesting part

01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:24,210
is calling in it database when he's

01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:27,420
doing in a nit database is he's checking

01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:31,440
to see if the park collection already

01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:35,040
exists right so he's saying hey get the

01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,990
collection teams if the park this

01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,610
collection is not count is less than 1

01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:40,320
that means there's nothing in it that

01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:42,930
means we actually have to load the

01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:46,470
database and so what he does through

01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:51,480
here is he actually is pulling in the

01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:53,190
JSON file and then sending that directly

01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,550
tomorrow to insert all the objects that

01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:58,170
are in

01:19:53,550 --> 01:20:00,440
that JSON part that JSON file looks like

01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,440
this

01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:15,070
right so he's got the name of the team

01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:20,560
their payroll the ballpark but then if

01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:21,610
you scroll over a little bit we are not

01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,030
doing it the right way we're actually

01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:27,370
doing a 2d right we're just saying

01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:30,100
coordinates where any just insert the

01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:35,110
coordinates in so everybody see that

01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:46,300
that's all the JSON is we go back at the

01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:48,040
end of this it's all finished right all

01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,480
the teams aren't here says another team

01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:53,530
is important and just keep going and

01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:55,690
then he's all done okay so now we've got

01:20:53,530 --> 01:21:01,360
the database loaded now we actually need

01:20:55,690 --> 01:21:06,000
to make the web services so if we go

01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:12,250
back up one more class go to MLB parks

01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:14,430
here's the rest interfaces so this is

01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:17,200
what jax-rs allows java developers to do

01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:21,910
for basically saying anything that comes

01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:26,830
into the server its URL slash parks gets

01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:28,960
handled by this class then we're saying

01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:30,070
inject the database right member i said

01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,180
i wanted to be able to inject it

01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:33,220
wherever i'm using it so i'm injecting

01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:38,680
it here so now I've got the database

01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:41,650
connection and so this method will get

01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:43,420
called so it's saying when something

01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:45,010
comes in four parts it does get

01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:48,820
collection that have basically pulled

01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:52,950
back the entire collection and returns

01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:56,790
it to those and it serializes it out

01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:56,790
right then it returns it

01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:06,170
the other one I want here is get within

01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:09,980
so here we are going to use the

01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:13,280
intersection query from to get

01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:18,969
everything from the bounding box so if

01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:23,630
there's a get to the past parts / within

01:22:18,969 --> 01:22:26,510
its going to call this method they're

01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:29,929
ready get how that works so when a URL

01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:33,020
the jax-rs router says hey if something

01:22:29,929 --> 01:22:36,170
comes into / parks / within call this

01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:37,670
method and it's expecting that they're

01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:39,980
going to get four different query

01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:42,920
parameters like one long one lap too

01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:46,900
long to this is obviously not production

01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,900
code because what am I not doing here

01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,250
exactly I basically just to suit you

01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:53,600
know what you're doing and you're

01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:56,330
passing in the line long as there is

01:22:53,600 --> 01:23:00,679
expected okay and then what you're doing

01:22:56,330 --> 01:23:04,580
is you're making so here's what you get

01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:06,350
the parks collection and then in MA bro

01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:11,210
what you do is you make objects to make

01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:14,300
the queries so I'm making an object I'm

01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:18,530
making a list to make the box and then

01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:20,060
I'm to the boxes I add one quarter in

01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:22,160
the other corner so basically what I'm

01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:24,980
doing is I'm making an ArrayList that

01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:27,650
has two points in it one corner and the

01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:29,630
other corner and i'll show you what i

01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:33,140
get these corners from when we get to

01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:36,230
the leaflet code then i say box query

01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:38,780
put a box and then I'm putting the array

01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:42,350
of those two corners right so we're

01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:45,290
doing a box search with those two

01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:49,400
corners then i'm doing a squeak spatial

01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:51,830
query put the coordinates equals to the

01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:59,239
coordinates going in with in the Box

01:23:51,830 --> 01:24:02,239
query right so I make a box then I say

01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:05,380
here's the spatial query that says where

01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:09,690
the coordinates are within the box query

01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:11,640
and then it's just a normal mom

01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:14,100
search which is Margo fine and I pass in

01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,840
that query that I made and that's just

01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,760
going to return back all the parks and

01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:21,090
then we'll send that back as JSON you

01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:23,790
ready got that that make sense find it

01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:26,699
i'm sending in two pairs of coordinates

01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:28,469
i create a box in that I then say this

01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:30,900
box is my spatial query and I want to

01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:33,210
find everything within this box it's

01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:35,070
basically what I'm doing in that cook so

01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:37,650
the court and then that just returns a

01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:44,310
bunch of JSON so the part that now

01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:56,580
handled all that is the time out to be

01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:59,130
here in here can I make this one font

01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:03,600
smaller tell me if this is ok still

01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:04,530
that's the low-k in the back yeah ok so

01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,650
I'm going to now we're doing

01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:09,120
leaflet ok we're done with all our Java

01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:12,090
code we're done with all our manga code

01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:15,630
how do we display a bunch of JSON

01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:22,260
objects so the only thing that's

01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:25,770
required I don't think there's actually

01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:27,680
any of the Spirit links in the top the

01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:31,850
script length i think is in the bottom

01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:35,880
know where I loaded up all right here

01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:39,060
the only thing that's required is we're

01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,260
going to load the leaflet j/s so it's

01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,699
it's own JavaScript plan where I'm

01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,960
pulling in from a CDN you can actually

01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:51,300
put it on the local machine if you want

01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:56,820
the only HTML in this is these two

01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:59,550
elements div one ID did and then the dig

01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:05,610
let's call a map if i highlight it does

01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:08,670
it make it harder to read yes ok this is

01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:10,199
that better now so yellow on the top so

01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:12,120
basically what I'm doing there is i'm

01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:14,250
making a did that i'm giving a title to

01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:16,380
called map and the reason why we need

01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:18,030
this is because we need to be able to

01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:20,070
plop a map into an

01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:36,180
like a container to plot the map into on

01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:38,400
the page so here we go we find it ok so

01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:41,160
the what we start what we start out with

01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:44,190
is we define a center point which is the

01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:46,980
center of the United States we set a

01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:48,480
zoom low so in most new web maps they

01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:50,460
have predefined zoom levels so we're

01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,930
setting the zoom level of 5 which is

01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:55,590
basically the entire extent of the

01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:58,460
United States ok then we say hey we're

01:26:55,590 --> 01:27:04,260
making a map so L stands for leaflet

01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:06,810
Matt this is here what container are we

01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:10,350
putting it in so that refers back up to

01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:13,320
this map right the ID back up here there

01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:15,330
you got that we're basically saying what

01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,460
container to put that in and then we're

01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:20,760
setting the view we're saying its center

01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:24,060
and the zoom level so now we've defined

01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:26,790
inside a container we have a map here's

01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,350
a lot long and here's the zoom level it

01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:30,780
doesn't have anything in it yet though

01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:34,020
we want the tile layer to be underneath

01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:36,450
of it so we make a tile layer this is

01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:38,190
the well-known URL in leaflet to

01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:40,170
represent tile layers coming from

01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:43,050
openstreetmap coming from lots of places

01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:45,360
actually now we're saying on this Maya

01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:48,120
the maximum zoom level I can go a distal

01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,440
18 and here's the attribution that out

01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,840
that I want you to put on the bottom

01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:56,220
right hand corner of the map so now

01:27:51,840 --> 01:28:00,180
we've made a tile layer and we add that

01:27:56,220 --> 01:28:03,960
Todd later to the back did we stop right

01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:05,940
here this is what we get when we didn't

01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:08,120
have any pins on the map that's all a

01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:10,230
code you need to bring some slippy map

01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,330
that you can move around and zoom in and

01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:14,910
zoom out and centered in places but we

01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:18,420
want pins on the map right so what we do

01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:22,340
here down here at the bottom we save

01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:26,130
back when ready get pins map on drag n

01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:28,290
get pins and math on zoom and

01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:31,290
get pins so if I when I first load the

01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:34,739
map and if i drag or zoom call this get

01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:40,370
pins function okay and this is what get

01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:42,929
pins looks like get pins is very simple

01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:44,670
math so I'm talking to the map again

01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:46,440
keep your boundaries and what that

01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:50,820
returns is the bounding box actual

01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:52,860
visible on the screen which is then what

01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:54,600
we feed back into WS parks within

01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:57,690
remember we needed up the corners of a

01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:59,310
box so all we're doing is saying hey Mac

01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:02,239
tell me your boundaries so I could pass

01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:06,210
that into the rest call on the back end

01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:09,360
so I do that and then I say that's the

01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:13,980
URL I say I make an AJAX call to my rest

01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:15,719
service get URL and him the map is what

01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:20,429
I want to be the callback and it's going

01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:22,969
to be in JSON format right that simple

01:29:20,429 --> 01:29:27,900
jQuery everybody good with that so far

01:29:22,969 --> 01:29:31,980
have I lost everybody already find it no

01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:34,350
we're good we're almost done I don't

01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:36,000
know what this is because I'm ignoring

01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:40,639
that that's him dealing with dollar

01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,639
values and stuff naughty not important

01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:47,310
yeah which I never do cuz I don't care

01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:48,960
about money the function but remember i

01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:52,020
say on the kodak the function is pin the

01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:55,440
mac so the first thing we do is we have

01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:56,820
a marker later group that we remove so

01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,110
the market later group is a place where

01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,360
you're going to put all the markers on

01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:02,340
the map right so if it's already there

01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:04,199
if it's already there i want to clear

01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:06,590
them all out because I Pandora's oom the

01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:09,570
map and I don't want to end up putting

01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:11,460
multiple layers of pins again and again

01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:14,639
all over the map I want to clear the one

01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:16,860
that's already there then remember the

01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:19,230
callback this isn't the data that came

01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:23,159
back from the callback amazingly loop

01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:24,900
through it and I make I make some pop-up

01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:29,460
information some more pop up information

01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:33,960
and then I made a marker and the marker

01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:38,389
is actually what is the pig so I give it

01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:38,389
a position i give it the X on the y

01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:44,770
and I bind the pop-up information to it

01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,480
so for those of you who finally got it

01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:48,640
did anybody finally get it to work I'll

01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:52,630
show you in a second where can I show

01:30:48,640 --> 01:31:04,030
you here did I already get it running no

01:30:52,630 --> 01:31:06,160
I never got it running you too baby i

01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:09,370
was running i remember by quick on this

01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:11,739
this is the pop-up information right so

01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:13,000
we found that to the to the pin so that

01:31:11,739 --> 01:31:14,680
whenever you click on it that's what

01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,680
shows up there's a ton of other things

01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:22,630
you can do with it in leaflet and so

01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:26,920
then finally after we've made me make

01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:29,860
one of those markers for each pin we put

01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:32,350
those into an array right so we say in

01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:34,000
the array list with that marker and take

01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:36,010
that array list of markers and we add

01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,930
that to the map and then automatically

01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:43,120
knows to just display them all and

01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:45,489
that's it so I know it took me a long

01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:47,469
time to talk through it all but if you

01:31:45,489 --> 01:31:51,790
actually look at this to add kids to a

01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:55,060
map that's actually not much code this

01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:59,050
is just an AJAX call this is just

01:31:55,060 --> 01:32:02,230
setting up the map these I don't know

01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:03,699
ten lines in all of the eats to put pins

01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:05,380
on the map with the pop-up information

01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:07,810
and still it respect all the zooming

01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:10,500
around and all that other stuff so if I

01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,500
go back to my slides

01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:26,800
spatial is easy and not necessarily with

01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:29,310
the open shift part thrown in but if

01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:32,440
this was in other ways it's really easy

01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:33,940
it's so simple even a bargain person can

01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:36,450
do it so how many of you actually work

01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:39,250
to read huh who doesn't work it ready

01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:41,110
okay so you won't know who Gordon is but

01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:43,420
Gordon is Gordon is one of the people in

01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:45,850
our company who talks to analysts so

01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:47,500
he's pretty imagine if you think about

01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:49,060
people who speak to analysts they know

01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:52,000
nothing about code and they're usually

01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:54,250
pretty high level he wrote this app with

01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,950
that same infrastructure so what this is

01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:58,630
is River gauge stations around Boston he

01:32:56,950 --> 01:33:01,300
works in our Massachusetts office he

01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:04,420
likes canoeing and the United States

01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:06,220
geologic survey publishes feeds Babji a

01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:08,020
lot of all these monitoring stations on

01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:10,240
rivers so if he wants to know hey I

01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:13,780
recall canoeing how's this river by

01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:16,150
Garth reading doing is it 1.61 feet 28

01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:18,610
cubic feet per second at that point in

01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:21,790
time and they actually put in a link to

01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:24,850
the river gauge information on the USGS

01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:26,590
study and he did that in about a day for

01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:28,210
a non technical person people have

01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:30,490
actually taken this template of his

01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:32,020
application and like in Spain they

01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:34,840
produced the map of all the National

01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:36,700
Historic trees there is big old trees

01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,470
and Spain and they care about them

01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:40,600
enough that they've mapped them all and

01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:42,310
they have a database of it and if we did

01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,690
that the United States some hooligan

01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:45,640
would go out and kill all those trees

01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:47,320
almost immediately but in Spain that's

01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,820
apparently not the case you can make a

01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:54,790
map like that for almost anything you

01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:56,350
want to do yeah yes I right guys I

01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:57,700
talked about how there was that JSON

01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:59,290
file that define everything in the

01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:09,340
application and you can have to do all

01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:11,380
those steps manual when you want to do

01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:15,610
this yourself you're not going to be

01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:17,380
able to on this instance because you

01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:18,880
have your own instance so the duck this

01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,320
I didn't put that in there because I

01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,400
wasn't I know how do I meds give it to

01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:28,330
you I'm gonna give it to you hold on

01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:30,460
hold on no no no here it is this is our

01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:32,210
road show information let me put it hold

01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:40,850
on

01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:44,540
I don't want that this is a road show so

01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:51,950
that's what / not we're so suave step

01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:53,540
comp there's a new version if you want

01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:56,000
to use that be all on one vagrant image

01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:58,280
that Jorge was talking about or that you

01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,560
can download from or open shift work /

01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:03,350
vm you can run through this using this

01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,150
training material except I don't know

01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:07,840
that you can you can you use the EAP one

01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:13,610
I don't know if we publish that one and

01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:17,840
two suitable with the ordinary you got a

01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:19,550
wild ride no already Stephanie please so

01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,410
that is a good question the question was

01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:24,440
you're saying fishing work with are you

01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:26,620
talking about online yes okay so the

01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,930
current version of online is running v2

01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:34,160
ok so the version which is the web cramp

01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:36,140
I do too there's a ton of repose of this

01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,850
that and my repos better because it

01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:39,980
doesn't do parks it actually does it

01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:45,969
doesn't do baseball because national

01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:48,170
parks it does run on the only one okay

01:35:45,969 --> 01:35:50,510
but the thing that you wanted to know

01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:53,540
the repo actually even though we went to

01:35:50,510 --> 01:36:00,110
talks to steves y0 calm if you actually

01:35:53,540 --> 01:36:08,390
just go to not that but this and instead

01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:14,210
of saying it's just je map the je maps

01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:22,700
no it's not Jez maps Stewie map that is

01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:27,200
the example for v2 without the v3 okay

01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:32,450
and that one works flawlessly every

01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:34,850
single time yes it does III

01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:39,730
towards Lee every single time I'm here

01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:43,760
today yes we get a bazillion roadshows

01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:47,480
using origin v I mean a openshift

01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:50,990
enterprise three dot one what and it

01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:52,220
worked flawlessly at every road show but

01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:56,060
there's something very interesting going

01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:58,940
on today no it's actually been really

01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:00,620
there's a chip enterprise which is where

01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:03,350
you can install that on your own cluster

01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:06,170
you don't amazon or whatever and that's

01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:08,470
actually released GA you can pay for it

01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:11,240
and get support and all that other stuff

01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:13,910
online will sometime later this year

01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,350
we've been moving over it's not a

01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:18,400
development though there's a development

01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:21,440
version which is Jeffrey called origin

01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:25,190
yeah the migration part will be fun any
