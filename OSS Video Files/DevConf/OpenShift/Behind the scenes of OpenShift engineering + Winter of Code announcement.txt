which week with which you can basically

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:26,459
monitor your boo containers and many GRL

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,469
images and content as well and Saturn's

00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,029
cetera if you want there's the link it's

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:34,799
pretty neat thing which is treated me

00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:38,309

and for a dashboard basically Madonna

00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:49,079
it's not an atom but it's a separate veg

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:53,419
board for our openshift platform which

00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:56,489
is not power but if it's very neat and

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,469
we decided to put him second price so

00:06:56,489 --> 00:07:00,419
you'll he will get t-shirt and a tablet

00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,810
as well and the first prize goes to

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:07,620
japan to came 0 not km

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:12,510
yeah yeah for Cooper Nettie is manifest

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,840
scanner and yeah its weak i'll play with

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,270
it instead it's great i cannot complain

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,340
with me how what it allows you to do is

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,430
that you can explore the API on a

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,990
command line so you can leave different

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,790
different fields for different resources

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,590
so it's helped you understand how the

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,990
Cooper Nettie said opposite works

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,790
basically it's very neat interface it's

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,520
working like a manual page or something

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,260
like that yeah we have any resources in

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,490
the open shift and cooperate is so it's

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:45,900
good to know what they do so the first

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:49,169
part goes to japan and enterprise price

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:53,190
goes again a second as a second year to

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:55,380
Spain to our enterprise customer from

00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:00,300
Madrid called for the ban and they

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:04,860
created basically two two submissions

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,530
one is a template which is associated

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,850
with images and second one is a railways

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:16,229
image for running java application from

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,539
open G which contains openjdk proto bond

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,520
is the IP shop behind the banco

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,560
santander so they're playing with your

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,600
money and keeping it safe and using a

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,950
lot of open shift so we're really

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,220
pleased to have them as part of the

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:31,950
community and we're going to send them

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,229
up some prizes yeah and directly through

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:37,200
their sales guys yeah we arranged them

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:42,960
to put to all their developers one

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,550
t-shirt so it's fair and that's it for

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,760
the winter of code and we have another

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,310
announcement from marketing that in

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,470

vet them and hopefully you put them on

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,640
how there is open source code do you can

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,040
yeah everything is to be so open source

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,460

thank you so back to banana passaic you

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,840
guys so yeah so this was the winter of

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,080
code and now this is the main

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,680
presentation so this presentation will

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,050
not be about about the project about

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,700
coding it will not I don't want to be

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,580
super technical what I found really

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:13,060
interesting is how openshift engineering

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:16,000
works like how we as engineers daily

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,010
daily basis how we work what tools we

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,710
use you know how we are structured how

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:24,550
how we manage to build a product from

00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,040
nothing to open v3 in like one half

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,830
years basically right so for me that's

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,750
very interesting and I just want to you

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,720
know share with you like how we work and

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,970
on what we use so before I start going

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,160
to tools and you know different kind of

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,350
stuff also the other half of this

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,930
presentation I want to use for the

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,120
questions so I was really I would really

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,490
love to have a discussion about like how

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,500
you want to use up a sheet what we want

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,480
to do one open shift like what's your

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,010
use case is what's your pain points you

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,690
know we can you can just make it

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,160
interactive so you can just ask us

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,070
questions about the country to be three

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,390
our Cuban at ease or whatever will you

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,340
find interesting you know we are

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,590
engineers so we can probably ask for

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,310
those questions maybe we know ask for

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:11,779
them marketing way or you know sale way

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,430
but we're trying to get your ass for

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,199
from the technical point of view and all

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,800
good answer questions will receive a

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:21,079
t-shirt so okay so let's start so so

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,550
before I go to the presentation I just

00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,499
want to show you the history of

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,019
authentic project bribe so which also

00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:29,209
predates me and the open Street project

00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,759
itself in redhead so I joined redhead in

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,540
two thousand fans so so pretty and we

00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,790
first announced a project online in 2011

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,120
that was basically done after we bought

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,519
the company took makara so we so redhead

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,230
told like Teresa's space on the market

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,430
for having something like a platform as

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:51,829
a service that space was basically

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,809
because of the J balls so people want to

00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,399
run tables applications more effectively

00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,439
if they want to run in cloud you know

00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,050
all these cloud buzzwords and that at

00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:01,639
that time come up so that was the day

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,610
when we announced our patient online

00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,920
then in one year we start with open

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,749
enterprise be one so that was the first

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,420
original version like in Britain open

00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:13,990
ship it was based on a custom

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,059
containerization that used selling eggs

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,819
Colonel namespaces you see groups and

00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,980
other stuff so it was pretty much like a

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,050
docker it was not that fancy as docker

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,899
right like it was not like a doctor on

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,459
docker create and dr. Poole basically we

00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,430
have the container detection technology

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:35,329
already there but it was not da crib

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:41,110
right and also the Ruby at that time the

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:45,410
protein was written in Ruby it has one

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,079
so it has something like nineteen

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,809
thousand lines of code which was pretty

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,689
small project but it basically was very

00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:56,839
very basic so then we told like with

00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:59,300
open should be to enterprise me too we

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,910
we basically want but we listened to all

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,370
the customers and users who wants to

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,980
also run the applications like an OG a

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,839
spider and PHP and so on so and they

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,499
also want to have something that they

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,389
can at the edge do their applications

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:16,759
like cancer geez Rather's we want to

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,970
have a database you want to have mughal

00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:22,009
Reddy's or whatever so so we we can wear

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,790
these cartridges format so the code base

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,310
within

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,340
here goes from nineteen thousand lines

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:32,000
of code to 116 thousand lines of code

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,220
it's not that much step right so but it

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,830
was still written in Ruby and basically

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,770
operation v2 is what you currently have

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,170
in online an operation online so if you

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,750
go to open ship the redheaded cone or

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:48,440
appreciated com you will get these

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,540
rights or gears you know arcologies you

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,560
know that and what we call what we are

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,980
calling up a shoot with you so then you

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,720
know this docker hype started right so

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,520
everyone was crazy about Booker

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,530
containers and containers and ochre and

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,320
docker images you know and sharing and

00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:10,160
you know unicorn simply where you know

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,830
and people really see as a people really

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,510
see docker us the way to go with the way

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,760
of the future how the container should

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,470
be done that for me the the most

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,570
interesting aspect of docker is that

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,150
they add this ability to share images

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,890
right so it was not just you have the

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,050
container running on your system and you

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,150
are fine it works for you but you can

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,740
also take that container in the its

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,870
content and share it with somebody else

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,970
right which also which allows a

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,980
beautiful things like you now you are

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,110
not tied to the source code but you

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,850
share the entire environment with your

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,060
application runs which we use a huge

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,460
step so and while in v2 we're still

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,560
using our containerization technology we

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,810
see this as something that people will

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,780
really want to do like a sharing you

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,480
know that social media and stuff that's

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,670
that's currently what people do so we

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,440
can ignore it so we have two options we

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,970
either go with our containerization

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,310
technology and build these images

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,160
concept ourselves and then we lock in

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,680
ourselves into this all right or we will

00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,320
just use what other people want which is

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,900
dr. images because Tucker and you know

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,550
these wheel and logo dr cohn's t-shirts

00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,860
and stuff you know that that people what

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,410
people are so so we we start thinking

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,060
about having the docker supporting up in

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,160
shape and that's how the opposite

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,620
victory started so before we start the

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,130
doctor she 33 is 11 in the same year we

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,470
spent like Hal fear in our DS and

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:36,130
we created project called geard look

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:40,060
leaf beardy that was the place that we

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,620
started to write go so so you can you

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,990
can think of openshift engineering it

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,340
was all a ruby all around the place Ruby

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,230
programmers even an administrator

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,060
operations was Ruby you know everyone

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,730
was written Ruby because everything was

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,920
written in Ruby you know and now you

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:57,040
know somebody can and say like okay guys

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,110
like we are going to just go why right

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,670
well because Cooper Nettie's is written

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,640
in go and Cooper Nettie's is what we

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,830
want to use for us to run containers and

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,960
cluster and also Tokyo is written lingo

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,900
so why we should continue writing our

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,970
software in Python or Ruby or something

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,580
else can we can have a native interface

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,640
to do current Cooper latex right so so

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,220
then you know how fear it out map it was

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,410
maybe faster but we all switch from Ruby

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,200
to go and we you know start writing a

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,710
go-go which was interesting because the

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,260
when we release appreciate v3 last year

00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:36,370
so in one year we managed to write to

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:39,010
hundreds at 100,000 lines of code in go

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,620
you know which was basically rewrote

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,120
that whole operation from scratch

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,310
completely from scratch which means like

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,020
we already have to burn at ease but what

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,690
koo Burnett is doesn't provide for you

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,730
is built so and really care about the

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,440
user experience and the you know for us

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,060
the user experience is that the user

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,640
have a source code and they want to run

00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,530
it in platform as a service so users

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,150
don't want to run containers users want

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,950
to run their application services and

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,870
the soul and build them from the source

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,829
code they have you know how many of you

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:12,400
are building docker images right ok one

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,860
three four five six seven I do count you

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,079
because you know you're doing so no

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,510
seven right seven people actually use

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:24,100
docker and build our images so how many

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:26,170
of you write code yeah everybody right

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,850
so that's what people want right people

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,350
want code people don't want occur images

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,000
but the docker images are nice because

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:36,620
you can place the code inside our images

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,380
somebody else so that's what we we go so

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,780
now we are here present so we are

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:45,950
currently on the opposite origin 311

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:50,000
which has 300 300 thousand lines of code

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,190
so you know the movement like that the

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,320
you know the effort that we spend as

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,150
engineers of Rights open shift and you

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,380
know put more features in it you can you

00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,540
can see that from the lines of code

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,940
actually you know it's growing rapidly

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,860
you know we do a lot of new stuff we had

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,010
controls that Cooper nineties doesn't

00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,870
have we do a lot of you know plugins for

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,520
communities and so on I don't even count

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,620
the contribution to Cooper methods and

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,140
ochre and to dokur right we have people

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,630
doing contributing to dr. currently on

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,280
github we have something around 100

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,600
active contributors so people that

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,520
actually write the calls and sending a

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,010
spool request we managed to have

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,320
something around 9,000 commits for for

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:33,680
origin seen it start so I think that's

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:38,870
pretty good numbers it's yeah I don't ya

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:41,600
do so so who we are so basically we are

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,240
a team of engineers we are globally

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,340
distributed we I think we use all time

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,590
zones I mean like we have people working

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,510
us we have the QA guys and testers in

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,360
China we have people working in South

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,820
America and Europe everywhere right so

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,150
so test you know beautiful how these

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,280
things work together so we we I'm part

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,840
of the developer experience team here so

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,940
appreciate is the obvious engineering is

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,980
dividing these four major themes of

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,900
course we have many more teams so we

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,850
have themes for networking we have the

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,890
in flora storage services storage and

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,260
another one but these are the main the

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,640
core engineering teams in open field so

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,760
I'm part of the developer experience

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,380
team which primary responsibility is to

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,750
build the developer experience or an

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,000
open shift so how developers are going

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,970
to interact with open shift right docker

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,880
images build how to convert your source

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,080
code to rank application tools CLI you

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,450
know everything that makes your life as

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,880
developers better then we have user

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,429
interface team which yacouba's in which

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,600
you know tear tear tear javascript

00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:47,659
and then we have more they do a great

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,179
job in making the drizzle so the website

00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:52,070
the atoms I said I can coach you all you

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,600
know the open should wait you can you

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,369
can see the containers and everything in

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,580
the web browser that's stage 0 and they

00:19:55,369 --> 00:20:00,409
do great job in doing that so without we

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,480
have also the integration services team

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:04,100
because the opposite currently can be

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,710
integrated with many other third-party

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,480
tools like eclipse for example rather

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,460
you can you can help you with our equip

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,200
plugin you can just create a new project

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,970
and deployed in open sheet and continues

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,679
of devil of that project and redeployed

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,840
it up in shape because i also have a

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,570
platform management team so that's a

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,759
that's a bit like a very low level team

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,440
for us because those are the poor people

00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,600
who are doing their basis to google at

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,119
ease they're basically getting the code

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,769
from commodities and rebates open

00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,360
shipping to boobies so it's very poor

00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:34,100
job they are also doing the load of

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,659
commits to cooper anything self so it's

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,490
kind of guys that working on the core of

00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:42,139
apps you a really cool coral organ shift

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:44,090
so low level stuff so these are all the

00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:45,740
pictures i took from the github page so

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,509
these are all the contributors actually

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,049
actively working up a shift right now

00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:53,450
and you know so we all working together

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,639
we have meetings will we do a lot of or

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,649
Indies we do a lot of design sessions

00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:00,080
and it's very challenging environment

00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:02,480
sometimes we even argue about things you

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,850
know we get pissed and made about other

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,710
guys i'm back shadings and pans yeah and

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,960
it's very important that open ship

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,909
itself is not driven by somebody from

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,070
management right like there'll be like a

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,139
big post saying like you do this right

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,259
and you do it this way so open shift is

00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:19,879
more like a developer based so we create

00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:22,129
the features in Trello i will show that

00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,629
later and then we go implement these

00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,220
features right so because we as a

00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:27,289
developer so we know what is the best

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,289
route of developers rat managers don't

00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:31,530
know what is good for developers right

00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:36,030
Layton paycheck

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:38,520
yeah so food yeah so these are all

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,310
recovered but we also have some very

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,140
smart guys there's actually supervising

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,930
all of those peoples that are great

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,270
minds about what the future of all these

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,310
things should be and how these things

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,490
should work each other and where we will

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:55,680
be in one or two years so we have very

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,590
smart people team like this is clayton

00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,570
he's chief architect for openshift

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,640
engineering so oh so he's basically

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,860
having the great picture about

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,540
everything right like all the my career

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,150
services or the different architecture

00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,400
see icd flows like he he is basically

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,560
the guy was saying yes or no on the

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,570
things that that would be basically he's

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,600
a great guy and this is how the bigger

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,520
picture yeah and it's funny because only

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,040
give him he his nickname is smarter

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,900
Clayton because he's smarter than us you

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,690
know and I worried someone alerted to

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,990
his nickname so he just pretended with

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:33,420
smarter yeah okay so that the tag was

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,790
about that so now what we what tools we

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,890
are using thread on our daily basis so

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,930
every dimension we have traveled

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,120
throughout troll is very easy going

00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,070
website where you can have different

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,070
boards and cards and you can basically

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,900
manage your project in agile way so this

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,910
is how developer experience still bored

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,710
looks like every team has its own turtle

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,350
board right but this is like how our

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,750
developments look like so this is a new

00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,480
board every new idea we have everything

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:03,060
that we get from you as a community you

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,030
know end up here so so basically we keep

00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,100
adding cards you know for features you

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,960
know that we thought will be good for

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,600
developers you know like then play

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,460
enable specifying volume or creating a

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,550
secret in template you know everything

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:21,270
goes here then every sprint we basically

00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:25,560
discuss what here should go here right

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:27,210
like what what is what is is its aim to

00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,910
do this or you know we do a lot of

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:32,280
discussion about every every card and we

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,650
discuss about like are we want to do it

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,180
are there any better ways to do it you

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,950
know or we want to really do this card

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,539
that it goes to beg walk

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:44,760
you know and you know it's sitting the

00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:47,340
big look for a while and you know what /

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,320
time it goes to next which is like what

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,440
we are going to do next sprint for us

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,659
the Sprint is three weeks where one how

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,340
fig is dedicated for development so we

00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,039
do development we really do the code

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,750
reviews and skype stuff and we can do

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,490
development of the other house but we

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,500
need to we need to give the cue a guy

00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,480
something to the game test right so

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,029
that's that's how we basically work and

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,830
then the in progress is basically what

00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,360
we do this print right guys so this is

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,760
what we are doing the spring so we have

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,059
internal get server ongoing for online

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,820
you know secrets and builds on issues in

00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,289
stuff and it is complete and so so we

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,870
use a trailer because it's very simple

00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:27,450
for us our trailer boards are public so

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:30,120
anyone can just come and make a comment

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,820
at new card you know involves see what

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:39,210
are we going to do basically or vote on

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:41,220
the features and so on so that's true

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,200
and that's the link for the trailer so

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:47,940
you can have you can see all the boards

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,880
there so the next two views is this is

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,950
hated and loved people hate it because

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,320
of the commands and you know

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,179
disappearing for spooge and blah blah so

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,230
there are people who hate it that room

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,740
full of it because it's actually

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,450
allowing you to have this social aspect

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,059
with coding cried so you write comment

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,830
and you can you can write a pull request

00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,899
and you can contribute can forego

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,330
repositories whether it's good or bad

00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:14,250
right but you use github because dr.

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,429
Reeves could have cooperate is good use

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,110
github and it makes the project more

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,820
visible for people right like you can

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,740
just easy go to kidnap and see all the

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,000
source code you can see the comments you

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,850
can see the pull request and what's

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,889
going on as I said we do a lot of code

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:33,330
reviews so I mean like we really already

00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:35,309
sometimes it's you-know-who picky it's

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,139
too picky but that we are really keen on

00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:39,120
having the source code that we do in a

00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:41,669
good shape so so we spend a lot of time

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,519
reviewing other people called trying to

00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,980
know suggest like better names for

00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:50,129
variables or

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,049
yeah or the reorganized a call or you

00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:54,960
know the open ship as I said it has like

00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:57,210
three hundred thousand lines of code you

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,820
spend one life to learn all of it right

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:02,100
so so what what we do with the res

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,470
reviews like we have a guys who are the

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,659
subject real expert for every every of

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,159
this part of the code so taking good

00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,600
suggestions for you so if you are

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,399
implementing something that already

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,590
exists in Coober net least they can just

00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:16,879
point it there and you know that's how

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,289
we keep our code by saying basically

00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:22,019
what is important is that we have a

00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:24,509
pretty strong integration with Jenkins

00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,980
so we run our internal Jenkins I can

00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:28,110
show you how that looks like and it's

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,080
connected to github and it's connected

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:33,840
to trailer and other things this is our

00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,789
Jenkins yeah resolutions crap and

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,450
because it's friday there is nothing

00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:40,950
going on here it's actually good like we

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,370
can track like how many people works

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,980
through the number of jobs running so we

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,779
have basically built everything to

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,250
Jenkins Jenkins is also commenting under

00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,769
pull request you can instruct the

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,259
Jenkins to build and test your pull

00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:57,269
request if you want you can also you can

00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,639
also specify what test should run in

00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:01,259
Jenkins what you watch your future is

00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:03,870
heading so we have a kind of extended

00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:06,389
placed concept where you can say ok I'm

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,940
changing something related to build so I

00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:11,159
can execute all extended days that

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,350
touches build and that runs for two

00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,149
hours and then it will tell you if you

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,730
break something or not we also don't

00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:20,039
merge on github so we never hit the

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,529
merge button on kita Jenkins's do that

00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,360
for us so Jenkees has emerged q so all

00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:26,820
the other polar bears are properly

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,860
organized there is no messing these we

00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:32,399
also built all the images that we can

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,019
publish a docker hub here in Jenkins and

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,549
then we just pushing them to grab we are

00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,279
not using the doctor have integrated

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,750
build service because it sucks and we

00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,909
can have a more control of what we are

00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,889
building so we can also execute the test

00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:46,379
against the images we can see the image

00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:48,720
is actually working or we broke them or

00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:50,519
something is wrong in them so instead of

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,919
just blindly publishing every committee

00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,850
on docker hub we can we know like what

00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,850
we are going to push

00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,659
and yeah so that's that's testing and

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,700
you can see like this is how it looks

00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:07,370
like on github so every time I tag the

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,110
pull request test Jenkins will report

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,269
the URL you can go check like what's

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,000
going on Jenkins and we also use a

00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:15,919
Travis so Travis builds let's like a

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,649
smoke test a lagoon tastes like things

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,830
compiled okay perfect now running in

00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:23,750
Jenkins and what's important like there

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,639
is one guy who is actually father of

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,590
this Jenkins infrastructure it's very

00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:30,049
complex infrastructure we are because we

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,480
are connected to Amazon abs so we don't

00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,159
have any slaves as you must listen in a

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,990
Jenkins screen every time we run

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,570
something we actually spawn an instance

00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,759
in Amazon and we run it there and then

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,669
we shut down the nice dance because it's

00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:46,580
more effective and of course like it

00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:48,799
requires a lot of plug-in works and we

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,899
have a special plugin for Jenkins to

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,009
actually manage all of these and you

00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:56,990
know and this guy in with a red head on

00:28:55,009 --> 00:29:00,350
it like he's basically an architect for

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:02,059
open who do all those TI flows he

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:05,419
also supervise all the engineering teams

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:07,610
and try to keep things same right so so

00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,519
he's participating old of meetings and

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,679
another great mind you know same with

00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:16,820
Clayton but not me they are the guy that

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:20,389
not him yeah yeah so this is how the

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,580
Jenkees looks like on thursday afternoon

00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:26,899
when the u.s. gets up so you know

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,159
testing testing very busy so the last

00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:32,299
thing i want to mention here is a

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,269
diagram so with v3 with opposite v3 we

00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:37,399
switch from the ABS based development

00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:39,080
let's say to use background as something

00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,509
that we can share with community and

00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,730
other people can have the same developer

00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:46,490
environment as we do so we have a

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:48,139
background file publish under origin

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,330
repository so if you just call the

00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:52,490
repository and debugging up you get the

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,440
developer environment all set up with go

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,299
installed with open Street installed

00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,580
insistently everything we set up for you

00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:00,860
so so you can just start calling the

00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,779
source code in mountain is mounted into

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,029
the background so every cochins you make

00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,310
is in background so you just to make and

00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,470
it working

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,900
update in binary restart open shape and

00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,720
you know it's very fast development i

00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,180
guess like we you know sometimes it

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,450
works and i see straight but what

00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,770
usually works so so this is something we

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,870
also so we have a special background

00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,640
openshift plugin that is also

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,020
responsible for compiling the source

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,640
code installing the carimi geez

00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,490
rebuilding the communities we have a lot

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,490
of commands there that you can use to

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:36,550
make your development for flow better

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,380
which is why I love working openshift

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,570
team because we really care about our

00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,000
developer environment I don't I don't

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:45,940
see a lot of other teams in redhead

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,460
doing the same so we spend a lot of time

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,740
improving our developers board flows

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:53,350
like what we do if there is some pain

00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,150
point or something that we found as very

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:57,100
frustrating because we need to wait

00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,410
hours to rebuild something or something

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,350
like that we usually go see and improve

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:06,210
that tool just to make our lives easier

00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:09,370
right yeah and other tools we use our C

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,710
so we are on the flag free note you can

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,450
join the open ship def def I will find

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,980
all the developers there as I said we

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,180
are distributed in the different time

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,740
zones so we are distributing different

00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:24,370
time zone so you should always find

00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,050
somebody online they're saved no not

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,610
always there's always some money and we

00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:31,090
also use blue jeans for video calls I

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:34,510
don't know why I put it there and yeah

00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,190
so that's it so that was the

00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,600
presentation that was all I have about

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,700
the patient engineering I don't know if

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,250
you have any questions about that you

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,250
can just shoot yep

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:02,860
yeah so yeah so the Jenkins had we have

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,200
a Jenkins bought that has is a user on

00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,650
github that is actually we have a medic

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,320
you in Jenkins so every time you will we

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:14,650
tag the pull request with comment merge

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,810
the Jenkins will execute some smoke test

00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,280
and then Jenkees will merge that pull

00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,590
request for you if there are like a

00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,780
concurrent pull request like so you so

00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:25,180
we have like 10 different polÃ­ticas and

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,890
all get merged attack right the Jenkins

00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,830
will make sure they will count in in

00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,200
order how they were attacked right so

00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,600
that that you know and that's like our

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,350
get these three yet we enforce rebase

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,550
because that without rebasing or if you

00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:42,130
have a cone figure something like that

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:43,780
your merge will fail of course right so

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,190
that that's preventing us from the

00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,460
program like you have three count or

00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:51,280
five concurrent marriages and the last

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,290
22 conflicts each other right so we

00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:57,160
junkies will just refuse to match it and

00:32:53,290 --> 00:33:06,240
send you the base message to remix so

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:08,890
that's why we use much q it yes yeah

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,560
exactly like you will see the DVF

00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,270
conflicts in on your own you request you

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:18,300
have to be based and then first push

00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:27,070
basically yeah

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:29,920
someone creates a test it yes yeah so

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:33,070
that is very important because a lot of

00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,320
a lot of projects that are merging as

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,360
crazy to master like they say like you

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,370
know the master should always be broken

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,530
you know like we don't care which time

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:44,650
to time we just really think that things

00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,030
are stable we just take it as a stable

00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,280
or something or create a stable branch

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,020
and they'll touch it right we don't do

00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,300
that we actually every pull request that

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,550
gets merged to the two to master is

00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:58,540
properly tested we never merge something

00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:01,240
that breaks things but in theory right I

00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:05,800
mean it at least it compiles and it runs

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:19,450
the unitary yeah but the goal is like

00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:21,490
don't don't break the master if you have

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:27,040
a free oh you mean like for me to build

00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:30,760
redhead com yeah rich club is v2 me too

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,700
it's it's not this version yeah we are

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,250
going to announce online sometime

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:44,120
plus-minus i can i can tell you date but

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:47,320
it is coming this year he was first

00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,320
go fetch you

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,119
yeah so appreciate this super complex

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:08,160
system but it is one static binary right

00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,080
in fact so so what what do you do is

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,810
like you just uses vary the static

00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,000
binary and redeployed right so what can

00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,470
break is it operation also depends on

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,390
different doctor images right we also

00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,119
run Duke registry we also run router

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:23,550
here we also runs you know the port and

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,020
stuff that can break and yes you need to

00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,970
be you know you need to rebuild those

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,350
images if you have seen if you are

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,860
changing the builders for example

00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:33,240
because done but you you know we don't

00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,300
do I don't think like we do a lot of

00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:39,030
testing like oakley we just rather cold

00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,700
and recompile it started make sure

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,320
everything works and then we send a pull

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,410
request and tag it for the extended test

00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,060
and make Jenkins do the job the dirty

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,340
job of testing that thing right if

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,930
something breaks Jenkins tell me like

00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,369
what's wrong and I don't need to sit two

00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,640
hours and watch all the extent

00:35:53,369 --> 00:36:00,450
destroying so that's what we do

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,430
basically and in the hole by Harry

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,940
everything is bundled icons or web

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:09,270
console opposite itself Cooper Nettie's

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:11,070
80 City not anymore hey to do this it is

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,530
oh god you can replace it with stubble

00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:17,320
you have a question when you

00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:24,400
from versions 53 you did about things

00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:32,080
because I was a choice favor was it a

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:34,990
big decision have to go and say yeah so

00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,350
so we'd wait to like so what it's my

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:40,060
personal opinion and in v2 we had a very

00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,370
good developer experience we have very

00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,950
good like from nothing to have your

00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:46,780
application running right but it was in

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,220
the other case it was limiting right

00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,750
because if you want to do something

00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,240
complex or you want to have like a

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,370
multiple cartridges or more multiple

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,250
gears that connects each other and work

00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:58,600
right that was what doesn't work that

00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,280
well rather because you need to write

00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,460
this crazy junge files with the

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,750
cartridges nobody will alight and

00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,330
understand the concept of subscribing

00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,420
and having like a scaling gap and so on

00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:13,420
so wittle like when we start working on

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,310
the v3 we took that and and we try to

00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,440
build like very complex system that

00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:19,510
allows you to do this complex things so

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,940
we told like the future will be

00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:24,610
microservices right people will try to

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,680
run like a different API servers you

00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:29,590
probably want to run the different rest

00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,870
api you have a warning you have a

00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,730
readies you have a caching player you

00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,230
have a database they can you have you

00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,570
know a lot of small components although

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:40,090
small services act that are talking each

00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,460
other so for me b2 and b3 are two

00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:45,100
different concepts right in the end like

00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,810
we might end up in v3 to provide this

00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,060
simple to use user experience we are

00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,530
getting there slowly but we need to make

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,240
first sure that all these complex

00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,820
scenarios that we want to satisfy are

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,590
working right that's why it looks very

00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,300
complex right now but give it one year

00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:02,860
and it we will have an Arab secret

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:05,590
create so so and I don't think it's that

00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,730
complex rather you have this nice UI so

00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,280
what you'll never finish because the

00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:11,200
Wi-Fi really sucks here so i'm building

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,050
the docker image and you know it's

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,090
pulling it's pulling the imogen but this

00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,820
is how the opposite UI looks like it I

00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:21,240
don't think it's that bad it's great

00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,240
it's great

00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:31,339
so yeah and even I'll ask you to these

00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:33,619
echoed managers view so it visualize how

00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:35,329
two different services talking each

00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:37,369
other how different components are

00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:39,529
related each other if for example you

00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:41,210
scale this up you know you see this is a

00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:42,859
real time so it will show you what is

00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,660
going on inside your project minister

00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:46,789
because we really want to tell people

00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,710
the story that they should go this

00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:51,440
microservices way because that was

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,700
Booker encourage people to do with the

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,650
doctor you can do this microcell

00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,279
resisting without looker it will be much

00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,809
harder to do this and without previous

00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:02,529
content yet assistive technology

00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:05,690
technology will be even more harder I

00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:08,839
see the real shift is happening on that

00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:10,250
three years ago we were all told that we

00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:12,529
depend on the source code right so you

00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,059
have a comet you have a thesis the comet

00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:16,670
I going to deploy the production and

00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:18,410
then you deploy to production right in

00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,029
this world is like yes this is the

00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,119
community source code I built a docker

00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:24,859
image and I promote the the build that

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,990
the docker image to production so you're

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:29,150
promoting the entire environment right

00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,869
so that's allows you to this is mike

00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,869
rosario system

00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:52,039
it's public actually touch you can go

00:39:47,309 --> 00:40:00,299
there yeah but my understanding it I

00:39:52,039 --> 00:40:02,309
agree request what you mean with merger

00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:05,729
question polar bears equals or movie

00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:08,430
yeah so somebody has to tied it with the

00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:10,349
test Glenda Jenkins runs does not

00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,029
automatically yeah i mean like somebody

00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:16,319
needs to edit the text from our

00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:25,769
organization from where you can be

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:27,420
tested yeah you know if you have you

00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,640
have access to the logs from the Jenkins

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,839
it's probably yeah you can just go to

00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:39,859
that URL there's a well there is nothing

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,859
private here like all public I suppose

00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:49,799
no it's not it just has we have had see

00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:52,469
I don't open pseudo redhat com it's not

00:40:49,799 --> 00:41:00,499
so this is just publish you can just go

00:40:52,469 --> 00:41:00,499
there yep

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:15,820
case a repeater it depends you want a

00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:19,690
fast or run slow and so so if I the

00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,460
development I usually go for what go 1.4

00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:24,130
because it's much faster compilation

00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:26,350
down much faster if you want to if you

00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,590
when we built this thing in Jenkins we

00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:31,930
go for 15 I guess because that's what

00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,000
this table well stable if that's what

00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:36,550
optimizing is but you know the problem

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,580
is that the girl 14 is much faster

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,080
compilation time comparing to 15 but

00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,400
between them there is no big for

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:48,510
incompatibility of something like a

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:52,420
compatible so doesn't matter really no

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:57,610
well we are going to the photo we are

00:41:52,420 --> 00:42:00,100
testing against detect variance I mean

00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:03,310
like we have a Travis that is test

00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,290
against all the colors yes but inside

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:08,260
the drinking's we just used whatever

00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:11,800
version we have in realm is some orange

00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:14,530
centos fedorov we don't have a multiple

00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,210
go versions that because you don't need

00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,300
to test that because the Travis will do

00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:25,270
the job for you I mean Travis is free

00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:27,720
we're going to pay for it yeah any other

00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,720
questions

00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:44,510
really good question do we have a

00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,510
marketing people here close your eyes

00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:11,400
yeah so so my opinion does is that we

00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,530
have these kettle where Zeus pet animal

00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,290
train ride so we treat containers as

00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,610
cable so so if something is wrong with

00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:20,460
container we just shoot it and start

00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,960
another one stateless right so i don't

00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,760
think that analogy applies to database

00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,740
is actually because metaphases is where

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,360
i have the money but i don't want to

00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,550
treat that obeys escape oh it's my pet

00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,320
if it gets sick i will go and

00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,150
investigate what's wrong with that is

00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:37,070
why the index is corrupted why my data

00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,070
are lost why my table is corrupted right

00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:45,750
there is no such thing so so if i will

00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,790
go to production I won't run database in

00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:50,820
on the ship I will probably dedicate one

00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:53,310
note as I will run and I will treat it

00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:55,290
as a pet there you know make my data

00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,180
safe and then I will in open shift I

00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:59,280
will create a service that points to

00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,290
that IP address and use it for my

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,600
deployments so i don't i don't use a

00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,310
data database I don't have a database

00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,320
container I run database is a first

00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,540
class citizen in my infrastructure and I

00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,869
just expose it as a IP address for the

00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,869
service

00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:20,770
persistent storage is very tricky like

00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:23,860
you know you can you can get it good but

00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:26,290
you never get it right so we are trying

00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,990
to get it good now you know it's still a

00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:31,900
little problem with that okay and before

00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:34,060
we end I just want to ask too much can

00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,370
