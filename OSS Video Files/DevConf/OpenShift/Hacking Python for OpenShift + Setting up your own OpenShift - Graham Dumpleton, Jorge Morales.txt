In this session Graham is going to show you what obstacled he faced when containerizing his Python application. Some useful tips and tricks will be presented.



Setting up your own OpenShift - Jorge Morales

In this session Jorge is going to show how to deploy your own OpenShift and because there is so many different ways, it's going to be a lot of fun!

so what I'm going to do is we're going

00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,280
to talk a bit about deploying puffin web

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,429
apps to open shift I'm just going to

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,290
show some of the basics of how you can

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,809
use of the source to image the strategy

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,060
in particular to get very quickly get a

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,199
party web app in now they've played

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,420
around with that and I've learned

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,820
various things from that and the current

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,590
support and open shifts sort of it's a

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,619
thing that's still evolving be improved

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,130
and what I've been doing is is working

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,480
on my own softimage builder images for

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,890
pipe and so anything it would go into

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,350
some of the things I've done with that

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,180
and some of my own ideas of where I

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,430
think they worshiped itself should go in

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:47,670
that area and how can be improved so

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:52,770
down further if you had all got this up

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:58,199
and gone down that's right you're up the

00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:06,720
back aren't you grandma's also a little

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:08,460
modest he created a multi-server that's

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
that's not the way to explain it the way

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,540
to explain is I killed this thing called

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,080
mod Python we're so deserve to the go

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,150
away as people should not be using it's

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,590
got it's a big big security issues in it

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:32,100
which no one really understands and

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:34,350
appreciate so deploying deploying

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,329
applications to oprah's you there are

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,540
free farming ways that one can deploy an

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,210
application to open ship the first way

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,700
is that you already have a docker image

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,320
oriya created from somewhere you could

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,380
have created light on your own laptop

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,810
and you've loaded it up to a registry

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,350
such as docker hub so you're able to

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,340
like tell open ship that I want to pull

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,649
that image down and able to run it up

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,070
like any other topics copper image if

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,409
you're talking about openshift products

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,450
from Red Hat then there's certain

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,340
restrictions that you may find we don't

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,430
like people running as root for various

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,200
reasons

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,079
so not every single doctor in which you

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,790
find up i'm dr. huffing less dirty work

00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:22,810
as long as people stand up so can run as

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:25,269
non-root users should be okay the second

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,069
way is that rather than you build the

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,920
doctor of it yourself you can

00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,709
effectively point open shift at a git

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,090
repository which has the code required

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,560
to build a dock for every so it's going

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,000
to have that docker file in there and

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,400
you can get open ship to do it on your

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,400
behalf and that saves you having to push

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,040
images around it can be really annoying

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,419
or using a voice using automated builds

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,909
on dr. hub which drive me absolutely

00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:54,310
nuts don't we have fun and the third way

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:55,989
which is one can do it is that rather

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,780
than build a docker image at all

00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:01,959
yourself you can what's called source to

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,959
image which will call saw strategy and

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,889
the idea with this is that someone will

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,469
build a base image for docker which has

00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,969
all the bits and pieces into require for

00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:14,620
programming in the particular language

00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:19,709
you're using and today we'll be talking

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:22,750
about Python and what happens is that

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,940
openshift can you point it at your

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,040
source of your git repository again in

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,150
this case what in your git repository is

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,709
just your web application code and open

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,409
ship will when it runs up the bureau

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,849
will pull that git repository down

00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,919
essentially corporate's it's going to

00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,299
create a new doctor image for you and I

00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,840
saw you don't have to know about how to

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:46,329
do dr. in yourself pour that into a new

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,569
image which built from that base image

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,790
the source too much base image and we're

00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:54,819
looking that source repository and in

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,590
the case of Python will install packages

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,239
and so on and it creates your final

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,370
image for you and so we're going to do

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
is it going to go through the source to

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,199
image running this I'm not going to do

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,709
the other ones to manage to the Python

00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,709
source to me

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,580
now I've got various web applications up

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,220
for us i'm going to using up on my git

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,160
repository i'm going to focus on a

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,760
django web application and i've created

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,450
that by CC just crazy french repository

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:31,560
I've done a django start project and a

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,480
great a day basically hello water it's

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,780
not much to up not anything special for

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,380
it for open shift so we're just going to

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,970
go from here now mostly notes you talk

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,950
about things in terms of deep roots in

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,840
the command line i'm actually going to

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,730
jump first into the web view our and

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,720
quickly show you how it will be done

00:04:47,730 --> 00:05:01,200
there so if i just copy the URL for my

00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:02,520
app oh I need to create a project is so

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,490
if you are following for you need to

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,320
create a I'm user user 00 so if you do

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,790
have the existing account sorry we

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:17,100
didn't talk about giving anyone else

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:20,150
than us righteous create so these are

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,560
all the source to image builders that

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,090
exist in the open shift installation

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,550
where you're using there may be some

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,660
quick start apps in there as well so

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,480
what I'm going to do is going to search

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,700
for the path of mine I'm going to select

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:38,480
a particular version apart from here

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,480
part 4 to 7 i'm going to call this Jango

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:47,910
LOL and give my good girl and there are

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,870
something more other options you can go

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,070
here and set and one in particular point

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,410
out is this thing down here which is the

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,790
routing there's actually a slight little

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,320
difference between when you do things

00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,650
through the UI whereas you do on the

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,720
command line if you do it through the UI

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,450
by default will expose your web app

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,350
automatically to the public internet

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,560
whereas to do it from the command line

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,420
that's a separate step used to confuse

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,030
me now and like I would keep forgetting

00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,030
that so we're going to create this

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,830
and that's going to go off and start the

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,620
point so what that's doing now is that's

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,370
pulling down that git repository

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,010
creating a new doctor in which

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,290
incorporate set source code and that's

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,820
what we call the assemble face is

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,080
controlled by these two central stuff

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,280
that's part of the source to each

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,810
builder it's the thing that's going to

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,510
go look at the requirement stop txt file

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,400
in your repository with have a list of

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,770
all the piping modules you need to go

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,200
and install them in the case of Django

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,880
it's going to it's going to realize

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,880
you've got a John Jago back by looking

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,310
at what the code is and run Python

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,900
managed by click static which creates

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,510
all those static files which you need

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:06,100
January for the admin interface and any

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:08,380
other things you're doing and that's

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:13,840
going to take a little while so we can

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:17,950
look at what it's actually doing we hope

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,040
is doing something here it's the first

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,470
time you've actually oh this the first

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,350
one thing is which is really annoying

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:30,640
for demos is that the first time you use

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:33,040
an image in a cluster it also has to get

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,630
it down from docker hub that shouldn't

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,120
be doing that because I've done in a

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,070
separate project so maybe it's happening

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,340
because I mean a separate account I did

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:45,520
it in a different account last time

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:50,460
anyway while that's going on let's

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,460
instead do it on the command line

00:07:53,139 --> 00:08:01,060
so the case of the command line i'm

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,249
already logged in so i got any different

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,139
projects here i need to be in the

00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,550
correct project and then was likely in

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:13,719
the wrong one moment because i just

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:17,169
created it and what we can actually do

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,699
here first offers even look at what that

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,139
other one is doing so it's it's still

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,150
waiting for the build so because i did

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,830
this in it in a different account what i

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,389
was testing it earlier looks like is

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,969
having to build pull down that image

00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:30,159
from somewhere first actually the

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,949
built-in image just shouldn't so

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,659
hopefully is not probably going on here

00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:38,169
so this time i'm going to create with

00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,060
the command line and now interested in

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,269
distinction here when I did it from the

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,209
UI I specifically chose that I wanted to

00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:48,910
use Python in a particular version and

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:50,680
here when I've done an OC new app I have

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,930
just given it the git repository and

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,920
nothing else I haven't told it's a

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,050
Python it and what's happening here is

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,610
Oh seen UF have some smarts in it that

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,440
when it gets down that git repository

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,579
will actually look inside but give your

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,130
posture and try and determine what

00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,350
language you are using so in the case of

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,420
Python it's going to look for whether

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,370
you have a requirement got txt file

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,949
which is going to be list of modules to

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:19,149
be installed by pit or it has a set up

00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:20,800
by file which is a older way that used

00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,010
to be used that before it became popular

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,140
as a way of installing a package of

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,209
application is an actual package itself

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:32,680
and you can have it your dependency

00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:34,899
assisted in there so in this case it's

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,490
sort of knows because I've got a

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,769
requirement stop txt file in there which

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,510
is listing Django that it was Python and

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:45,490
it's going to get on fire off Python for

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:47,920
me what how we do we'll find out if it

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:52,180
is fine on laura piper three this is

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:55,269
matt mitchell so open shift installation

00:09:52,180 --> 00:10:00,550
is this now supports part in 27 33 and

00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:02,500
34 no free five yet and the free for

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,440
image essentially is tagged as being the

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,200
latest so if you go and do a deploy its

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,030
going to use you

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,530
is the latest one and so in this case

00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,790
it's going to be using Python 3 for the

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:22,730
alternative is if you know you want a

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:30,380
particular version there is a Python to

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:33,200
top 7 or dash here I got in my notes to

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:38,150
G it's a part of mange protection ya

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,850
know I from coal and 27 so yeah so

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,070
that's why you can actually stick select

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,100
a particular version own and we're going

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,300
to actually use that ability so

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,850
essentially what we're saying here is

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,170
here's our source code and this is the

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,200
particular builder that we want to use

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,490
in this case it's part from 27 and we'll

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,310
use that later when I start talking

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:06,320
about different builders and replacing

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:08,890
the default one so let's see how this

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,890
thing is going

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,639
ok so our original ones up oh no sir now

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,240
that's interesting out our original one

00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,490
is still going for some priests but the

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,920
one we just created is fine so let's

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,449
look at the one we created and and here

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,329
is what I meant is that you look at the

00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:32,959
top I'm here it's got an a this is going

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:35,839
to be the actual URL and it's running

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,060
very slow because we had the previous

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,579
workshop running maybe someone's been

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,350
doing some interesting things with

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:44,689
scaling up a lot of businesses and after

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:49,360
that's all running a bit slow we'll see

00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:52,129
how we're good so that one had a URL

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,009
exposed euro already this one didn't so

00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:57,040
because did it from the command line

00:11:54,009 --> 00:12:02,180
we're going to need to expose it and

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:07,819
that's done using these Osieck spurs so

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:13,850
exposed service unless if we can get to

00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:16,459
this one yes and for django app if we go

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:20,809
to admin you'll see that the admin works

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:22,490
we have style sheets working so our

00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:25,120
static files are also being hosted

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,120
automatically

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:36,000
that much just be brushing which is a

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,000
key

00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,040
now 100x I'm talking about application

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,420
deployment workbook because it's all

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,250
well and good that you can get an app

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,300
updated what does that mean to the way

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,380
that you in a work day to day now it

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,529
doesn't change it too much and

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,990
perspective relative to how you're used

00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:01,850
to just doing database development we've

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,519
Django you got the development sir which

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,440
is built in so nothing changes it you're

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,810
going to work on this thing you still

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,820
make your changes you Django development

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,320
server use effect that we can do code

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,779
reloading to automatically pick up

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,209
changes if need be and nothing's going

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,089
to change there but we still need to get

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:23,620
that changes up to up and deploy

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:26,959
publicly so publishing the code changes

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,910
we created this originally against a git

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,699
repo Souls you're going to check that

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,170
out so the workflows basically do your

00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:35,690
local development with python django

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,760
development server when you're happy can

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,820
make your changes and push them up to

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:46,160
the git repository now if you're

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,870
familiar with open shift v2 I find that

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,029
the way how they two worked a little bit

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,579
confusing actually because you could

00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,699
just create your git repository locally

00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:57,079
on your desk well actually open ship

00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,449
itself and respectively was running a

00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,550
git repository call you get stedelijk

00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:03,320
you have inside of open shift and so

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,579
when you created your app there's a few

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,010
things that could happen but generally

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:08,720
you create your app an open shift and

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,750
then check that out and then started

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,269
making modifications in math or

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,620
alternatively you to do that initially

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,360
but you might already have an existing

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,970
app so you know these funny messing

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,550
around with changing it to then push

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,620
through open shift and do a force push

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,380
initially to update any other thing is

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,360
that to do deployments pregnancy and be

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,339
to your door your code change is

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,170
committed and you push them direct into

00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,970
Oakland shift and that would cause your

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,440
weather changes to then actually be

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:42,079
deployed in open shift be free you've

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
told it where your github repository

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,750
exists or whichever others public or

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,310
private repository it's linked to and

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,610
you know instead of pushing your changes

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,459
direct to open shift you just push

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,990
gee normal repository and at this point

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,630
there is no linkage between that

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,730
repository and open that means that

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,220
if you do want to trigger a new

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,320
deployment based on code changes then

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,329
you have to trigger a bill and that can

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,070
be done on the command line using a OC

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:12,940
start build or you can do it through the

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:17,290
UI and I'm really hasn't to trigger

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,690
honey if this is going to um well that's

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,890
it this is failed okay and I'm going to

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,180
assume it's a timeout get each other

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,310
well i'm pretty sure it's going to be a

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,860
timeout yeah this is the problem of beer

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,420
scene occasion on our own cluster we

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,490
hadn't seen on this one we're using for

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,290
the dimmers but let's use that fact we

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,370
can go in here and go build so you've

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:41,470
made a change I can go and go to start

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,029
feel and that's going to pull down the

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,240
latest version of the source code from

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:49,480
the git repository build you a new image

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,570
and deploy and that all happening that's

00:15:49,480 --> 00:16:00,880
a manual process but what we can do is

00:15:52,570 --> 00:16:04,089
that I'll skip that bit we can use

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,920
what's called web hooks and we talked to

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,600
look grant alphabet is a little bit in

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,250
the previous workshop enough so I wasn't

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,300
going to go into depth with it but the

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:16,089
idea here is that you can get what sort

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,130
of web URL from the configuration you

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:21,430
know can ship your your project or

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:23,709
application and you can set up github

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,990
with that web for and what that means is

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,540
now is that every time that you commit

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,880
to the git repository up on github it

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,529
will automatically notify open ship that

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,089
there's a new version of code there and

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,940
that will automatically trigger a bill

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,529
and so you get the same effect as what

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,510
you could do is open you should be two

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,800
of when you did a push does it change

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,839
that's just going on a different way

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,980
it's going by where you'll get ripples

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,120
through this this time rather than

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:52,800
direct into open ship let's see how it

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:57,089
builds going at you hey the summit work

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,089
so we've got to 2d pointers

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,070
yeah it's time

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,870
now what about if you don't like the

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,480
fact that to get this now deployed I'm

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:18,510
having to always commit my work and push

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,329
it up to github if you are doing lots of

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,520
little changes like you've done all your

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,490
work presumably with Django development

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,980
server but you get situations where your

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,570
deployment environment is going to be

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,490
different to your local development

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,010
environment and so sometimes you can

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,600
have a problem where you can't replicate

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,150
an issue you're having in your life a

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,530
developer environment you can only see

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,600
it occurring in your actual deployment

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,929
environment and in that sort of

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,520
situation what you is a pain is having

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:50,309
to make a little change on your poetry

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,840
do a commit and wait for the bill to

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,159
occur and then find well that didn't

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,549
quite work I'll go and make another

00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:57,840
change to another command and if when

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,480
you do that you end up with all these

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,559
little commit history in your git

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,780
repository and some people don't like

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,380
that sort of little trail of all those

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,909
commits you could do rebasing and

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,010
squashing a list of nonsense and I

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:15,360
personally don't like that so the

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:18,150
alternative of what you can do is what's

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,860
called a binary we may use is that I'm

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,799
going to barnacles so you've got your

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,140
application already set up and when you

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,020
we did that start build previously it's

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,730
going to cause openshift to go back to

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,620
your git repository and what we're going

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:35,970
to do this time is circumvent that

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,440
process and we've got this commandeer OC

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,549
start build I'm going to build our

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,380
particular spinning and we're going to

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:42,120
say but take the source code from our

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,710
parent directory on our local box

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:52,250
instead it from gear so let's uh where's

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:55,970
out which one will use this one

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,970
so I've got my hello will

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,640
I should make a change now I had not

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:19,890
committed this and I'm going to sneak up

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:21,450
oh so shut up okay so this this time

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,630
we're tapping is rather than getting the

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,580
source code repository for the remote

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,140
git repository it's bundling up the

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,820
directory in which I've run this and

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,230
it's going to push that into an open

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,620
shift and this time the build is coming

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:38,880
from them so let's see if ricans see how

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,170
long this one's going to take so this

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,580
you can see where the builds happening

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,960
was just dump it over the you is

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,300
probably just easier to watch other

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:52,200
video so that's already built it's spun

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,760
up that new one just a warning to

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,190
default that the moments this is using

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,690
Django development server and I don't

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:02,429
know what is that generated open server

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:04,920
but it doesn't respond to see turn

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,720
properly and it's taken 30 seconds to

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,280
shut down that's why we see here without

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,800
actual are you running that should have

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,620
been taken out of the rally so we should

00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,990
now be able to go over here and there's

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,760
that change so I never put that up to

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:23,910
the git repository so that's one way

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:26,240
that one can do it and let's try another

00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,240
way

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,909
now that doing it from the current

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,919
directory only if you set one current

00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:37,990
build if we were to trigger another bill

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,610
it will go back to using the repository

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,409
it's not a tournament tournament linkage

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,539
so if you're happy you done the right

00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:45,279
thing you can go commit that push-up

00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:50,169
starting a bill and I'll go to get

00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:52,929
repository next time you could do is

00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:54,159
life cycle source code changes so what

00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:57,700
we're going to do this time is you can

00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,610
actually get into the running container

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,860
now if you're familiar with so for

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,220
example Heroku there was an ability to

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,120
with Heroku to get access into a dyno

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,980
but it was a special Dino that was the

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,539
run-up just for your shell access it

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,159
wasn't the one where your web app is

00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:18,909
running so you couldn't do live code

00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,590
changes in openshift you can actually

00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,720
get the information at which particular

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,630
pods are running your app in this case

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,240
we only got one grab more than one this

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,529
gets petisco we've got one we can

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:38,020
actually get inside of that running

00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:41,250
container and make code changes so

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,250
here's our running at down here

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:53,670
so I'm inside my container and summary

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:58,620
is not always have to set terminal so

00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:01,250
there's my modified one goal is a set

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,250
capitals

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,020
and there's my change now that is work

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,460
because it is using the Django

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,640
development server inside of the

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,840
container as the default that's one of

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,540
the things I'm not necessarily homie

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,960
happy with the default builder because

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,270
using gentleman sir review do Shango

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,890
that is not a production great server

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:29,060
you should never use it various reasons

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,760
something not going to be performance a

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,010
single process of a single Fred and and

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,350
yes we open you could scale up and

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,480
create more instances with one president

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,660
it crash that way it's not not a good

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,660
situation

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,730
now does yet another way we've got of

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:57,990
working Wallace and grant touched on

00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:00,730
this in the previous workshop so we can

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,799
do a build which is triggered from a

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,600
parent directory we can get into the pod

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,899
to do stuff the other option is you

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,850
notices OC parsec allows you to crack

00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:11,889
see Michael he changes locally on your

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,019
box and sister just asked think that

00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:17,049
changed carrot directly into the running

00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:20,549
patina so let's get this one to go so

00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:20,549
what are we on we're still on capitals

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:37,860
you get out of here what letters will

00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:37,860
use this time yeah eggs sir get close

00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,279
so I'm going to rsync just sub directory

00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:53,070
which has my appt unit I need to specify

00:23:47,279 --> 00:24:02,369
the pod now you do need to know where in

00:23:53,070 --> 00:24:07,289
the i'm bound to got that wrong so let's

00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:14,789
just go check it opt a trip source for

00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:16,799
the world knowing better right how do

00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:22,019
you know which part do you need to

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:27,989
replace the apt booty with a peep of up

00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:31,979
/ app- room go to the left hip you be

00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:36,389
more like more wallet sup and not other

00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:39,299
take with a PT a-- and ok so let's not

00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:42,239
like that directory push it up there and

00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:53,309
because of our see our images have our

00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:55,470
sig okay so in this case i've done an OC

00:24:53,309 --> 00:25:02,489
get you see that right on the bottom we

00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:03,659
good there are different types of pods

00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:04,799
it's the ones which actually have you

00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,659
running app and you'll see these other

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,570
one creature to build pods and you'll

00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:11,879
see once and pop up deploy so it's the

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,529
case of just um you you sort of

00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:15,720
understand learning over time which is

00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:18,179
the one but we've got that one pot dear

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:25,499
of that there's other ways of doing it

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:28,849
oh so you describe i'm doing it from

00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:28,849
memory now so probably get this wrong

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,890
is it service a replication control

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:50,230
hi is this other way of doing the term

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:56,120
I'm doing though I so I'm selecting it

00:25:53,030 --> 00:26:00,260
from there now someone said that yes it

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:07,490
failed or a pizza fail I've got the

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,900
wrong one ever afterward I must be

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,130
giving it the wrong directory let me

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,130
just cut and paste that

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:40,460
hey interesting running stay the first

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,460
one

00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:49,770
oh that is that when i created with a

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:55,590
web app earlier that's not the one I'm

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:58,830
using now um this is this is one thing

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,540
about doing are things that is important

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,570
now builders to set up this one you need

00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,610
a nasty man in there but all the

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,670
permissions have to be set up in a way

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:11,010
that when you do make changes in the pot

00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,240
you can actually do them our elk one to

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,810
set up to do that if you take an

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,460
arbitrary daughter Emma job so hard and

00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,190
try and do this it may not work because

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,230
the permissions may not may be set up as

00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,760
proof or something it's running in on

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:29,300
root user and so you might be able to do

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:37,260
it I can't see exactly what problem is

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:41,070
oh oh yeah yeah you're right I've done

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,960
it once before and that first time we

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,270
saw all the files chase yes this is only

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,000
on the directory and I need to talk to

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,610
something about why this occurs but I

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,320
have noticed this it it can't act to

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,540
update emissions on just the directories

00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:04,650
all the files get updated agenda strange

00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:06,720
message now grant gave a interesting

00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,060
example the last talked what grant does

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,270
is actually sets up his editor so that

00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:15,120
when everyday's a file locally he will

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:17,940
automatically go and update all these

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,030
things in one of the questions of how do

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,470
you find the pod and actually here is

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,810
here's the way that I came up with

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,670
either if it's little script here so you

00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,370
can actually use the OC get haads

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:31,050
command and use what's called a selector

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,070
so I'm going to select just the pods

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:37,560
which are for my particular application

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,930
and i'm going to ask just for the name

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,580
as the pot now i'm on the basis that

00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,290
learning i had one single pot so i'll

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,490
get my pod name like that and then i'm

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,200
going to feed that into the arson

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,620
command so you could if you're in an

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,120
editor environment set your set your

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,120
editor up so you could run this little

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,230
script and just give it the name of the

00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,790
app

00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,350
where you going to do it from however

00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,450
the editor works it out and wait what

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:05,010
your destination is and no way you could

00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,010
trigger it off of doing out the editor

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:17,170
anyone tell me when they submit to

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:18,310
finish about 10 more minutes yes and so

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,780
that was one of the key things I wanted

00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,630
to talk about in the Indus London

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,930
different ways you could work with it

00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:28,090
because you know people look at the look

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,410
at openshift and/or any pests like that

00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,560
and they think they have to change their

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:35,200
work fare around totally and just you're

00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,370
in a much much strange way you do there

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,630
are some things which are different but

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,450
the basic things still work like

00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,160
resultant server and community so on

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,510
you're still doing a lap but you can try

00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,070
and set up those workflows your we're

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,650
trying to want to make things and you do

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,810
have these ways of doing live changes

00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,270
still you are looted from doing that

00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:55,320
which a lot of you looking for I can't

00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,320
make life changes anymore

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:07,789
and now a bit more about the default my

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:13,789
daughter and we'll finish up there after

00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:16,309
that so it's doing a lot of automatic

00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:18,830
things here and like magic is good when

00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:20,270
it works because you don't have to

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,669
figure to how you can just get you git

00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:25,010
repository it'll hopefully just deploy

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:27,860
it you have to worry about it now what d

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:30,049
the default Billa currently does is it

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,720
goes to our strategy a few different

00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,730
steps trying work work out how it's

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,020
going to deploy things and the first

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,870
thing it will look for is whether your

00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,820
upholstery has an appt top py file and

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,470
in that case it presumes that you're

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,600
going to supply the whole python web

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:48,799
application so in this case you might

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,299
for example being using tornado AC so

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,820
the wrath of Mother so you actually have

00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:55,250
your Python App top pie it's importing

00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:58,640
the tornado module files setting up all

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:02,419
your hands and basically running it for

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,820
you or you could in evening using

00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:08,120
tornado still be using whiskey app but

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:10,340
just using it it's whiskey container the

00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,200
next day or do is if you've got unicorn

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,840
install so if you in your requirements

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,000
txt file having solved guna corn as part

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,470
of your packages it will go through a

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,860
look and see whether you have a whiskey

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,600
pie file somewhere in your repository

00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:26,000
which is beginning to be containing the

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,559
whiskey application entry point and if

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,870
it finds that it'll run up unicorn

00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,990
against you so you have to define how

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:35,929
the server is actually started up

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:38,390
finally if you have a managed by file it

00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:46,940
assumes you're running junger and it

00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:48,529
will just reuse Django run server you

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,440
don't f will be fine but you can you

00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:53,120
find others

00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,190
yeah that's one of my issues with the

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,690
country but default bill at the moment

00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,669
that's a bit difficult to try to

00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,100
override everything your your only

00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:03,500
options are basically goon corn or a nap

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,899
top profile and that means if you run

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,629
away want to run you whiskey for example

00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:11,240
you would have to have an appt pie file

00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:16,190
which doesn't owe a success of your

00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,990
whiskey binary which is a good the other

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,139
thing is it use it does push you towards

00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,419
unicorn which me personally okay I'm but

00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:24,710
very biased but I wrote my whiskey but I

00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:26,450
have very good reasons for thinking that

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,049
Unicorn is not necessarily good choice

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:34,850
for pétain Erised environments it's it

00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:37,460
has any single request worker / process

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,350
which means if you need to scale up you

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,230
have to create more processes which

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:45,080
means more memory and in a past

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,429
environment yes you've gotta worry about

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,929
you should be apart from global

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,389
interpreter lock but you also got memory

00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:53,480
constraints and and so having to scale

00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:55,159
through using model processes it's not

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,110
really good if you've got an i/o bound

00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:58,970
app it's often better to spell using

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:02,059
Freddie because the girl was not a

00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:06,110
problem so that's one of the ones I'm

00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:07,850
not too keen on the binnacle and its

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,759
article pupsters so alternative park

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,950
next to idols so a fish it does provide

00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:16,070
a default but you don't have to use it

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,559
you could write your own s2i builder if

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,480
you want to do style and bone and you

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,159
might say I ki won't do anything to do a

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,570
source sort image and just build your

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,970
whole daughter image from scratch if you

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,970
wanted it most people out there that's

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,490
what we can't doing the source to image

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,889
is good because especially if you're

00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:37,429
coming from a DevOps background because

00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:40,000
you can say to the developer you just

00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:43,070
need to worry about writing your app

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,320
here's the s2 I building you can use now

00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:47,690
maybe default or they may have to

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,730
develop their own one and that allows

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,500
them to incorporating that builder image

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:55,730
all the things that day is ops people

00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:58,429
want to see in there that mainly from so

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,590
for it might be a particular Python

00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:03,110
whiskey server they won't use they might

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,860
want monitoring now such as New Relic

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,690
embedded

00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,490
need to do monitoring they settle out of

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:12,020
automatically so you as it developed

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:14,600
isn't okay now obviously i'm keen on

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,940
like whiskey so I've been playing we're

00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,520
having my own docker images for quite

00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:23,679
some time I only started with redhat the

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,850
middle last year come here last year and

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,230
I was doing before that and since

00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,359
obviously you got into red hat I've

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,300
taken by existing image source to

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,090
imaging that enabled it and I'm playing

00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,950
with it and my latest incarnation I'm

00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:43,129
just going to say where where I'm at

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:47,629
with that okay so this is where i'm

00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:49,070
going with my image and i sort of say

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:51,139
missions of your mission is what if you

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,970
want to take over control because i want

00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,520
to be able to do that so I provide a lot

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,980
more options in my image and the idea is

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,540
that I've done this and I'm talking to

00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,010
the people other people read hurt with

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,450
developing the default and I'm trying to

00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,680
get them to do changes to incorporate

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,470
some of these instead of getting proved

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,210
on so the default works better but also

00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,869
you still have this option extremely and

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:13,790
I'm sort of hoping that with my one

00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:16,340
because I want to do things that red hat

00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:19,280
would never want to do it nests I like

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,200
here's saw Star Wars the Python so you

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,359
have the latest versus packaged for

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,300
example i'm hoping to get community

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,570
interest in my image and perhaps get

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:32,570
webcam india cooperating to have a web

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:35,570
community management and then way we can

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:38,000
come up with a best-of-breed one and

00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,700
that'll be an option you know bushes do

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,680
you have the bus

00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,630
before you have more defaults to do

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:49,339
create profiles please open up on shoes

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:51,410
and you can choose what your course okay

00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:53,539
so the only default that really exists

00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,910
is that if you use OC new app of the

00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:57,680
command line don't tell it to use the

00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,559
pipette image it'll do that language

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,589
detection in that case it then once it

00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,529
says it's Python will look for the image

00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:09,259
stream which essentially docker image

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:12,859
for called passion now if you wanted to

00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:14,660
use that language detection but that

00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:17,569
didn't want to use a default then you

00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,680
can create a in which stream local to

00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:24,170
your project which Maps Python to mine

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,440
for example and that way you could

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,849
override it hopefully that works i found

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,289
an issue of it in the last version i'm

00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:32,329
not sure haven't tested the one we've

00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:34,400
just released as to whether that

00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:37,970
overriding does it work but that's the

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,710
idea see but besides the language

00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,999
detection you're going to generally

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:49,819
specify the Builder you want to use

00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:51,589
anyway it'll be nice and yeah nearly

00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:54,619
ways to override the Ute to python

00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:59,930
industry that's probably any way i can c

00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:01,910
do it so in my image if you want to use

00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,489
USD or just turn the control you want to

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:07,849
run any command line whiskey server I'll

00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:09,200
a you provided hack sure so shell script

00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:12,529
and you can learn whatever you want

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,079
however you want it looks for a nap p

00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:19,099
why it looked for taste like any fault

00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:20,960
its you're using paste or the pylons or

00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:23,930
pyramid which you use we're set

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,880
something and you will just go and

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:29,839
automatically run up so if i'm using my

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,430
booski express set to do that that's

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,160
sort of if you're not familiar with is a

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,329
bit different to straight mod wiki so

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,180
modern business press a little bit of

00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:40,009
confusion over mud whiskey expresses you

00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:45,079
install that you basically go pip

00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:46,910
install mod disney and it's not anything

00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,130
it's not as totally new whiskey survive

00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,049
written it's still mod whiskey but what

00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,510
mod whiskey expressed does it's just

00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:54,760
generally apache

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,350
for you on the fly so you don't have to

00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,410
do it so you're relying on the fact that

00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,580
I know how to set up apache and probably

00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,770
going to do it better than what the

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:05,200
default config is that you'll find on

00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:09,790
your your field operating system is

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,200
generally set up to 380 but nothing

00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,730
special about it just saves you a lot of

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,010
effort I look a whiskey duck pie file

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:20,710
and if you come from open shift to the

00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:23,080
default build up so it doesn't have a

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,590
sort of upgrade path my 1 i've been

00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,610
sitting around with it it will sort of

00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,220
look do some of the things that open

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:32,890
should be to do with knowing that if

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,930
you've got a whiskey / static directory

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,360
it's going to be static files or mounted

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,580
a / static or if you go too risky

00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,650
application file to actually whiskey I

00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,090
foldable so try and do that that

00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,450
equivalent so you can have an upgrade

00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:51,190
part set up the pipe are again look for

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:53,230
and a man you skype so may surprise

00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,030
Django the important thing is i'm not

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:59,140
using general development server here at

00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:01,240
all it will actually query using managed

00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,700
by to find out what the configuration of

00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,370
your january is and automatically run it

00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,750
up under a mod whiskey express so you're

00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:14,950
going to have a production great server

00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:19,030
and orders how are we going for time one

00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:26,770
minute so very quickly then you get to

00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:29,440
the that question of taking control so

00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:33,160
by default it works in an auto mode so

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,500
i'll look for shell perfect so effed up

00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,970
 up top I page or Django that works

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,740
in the auto mode I'll generate all the

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:42,430
stick I guess if you want to take

00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:44,620
control you can instead set in

00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,570
particular file I want to use Guinea

00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,210
corn or I'm going to use mod miss Bo or

00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,040
waitress for you whiskey and in that

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,500
particular case when you do that in your

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,600
taking control then it's up to you to

00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:03,940
provide all of configuration and I've

00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:05,430
got various examples here and yeah I'll

00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,960
leave it at that

00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,220
if you go to the taste is very samples

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,850
you can dig around there there's a

00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:18,220
particular file which is set called warp

00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:22,200
drive server are a server type do i see

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:24,430
it i mentioned know okay so there is a

00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,960
warp drive center types and that's where

00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,910
you can specify what if you need to

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,700
override and certain MIT the algorithm

00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:33,490
what accuses and there's a server adds

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,200
file third what it will do is that

00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,720
you've said you want to use booty call

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,900
but you don't have to run Google I'll

00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,970
run unicorn food for you and I will

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,850
supply the minimum options that are

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:48,610
needed to unicorn or you lose your

00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:51,100
waitress to have it work properly inside

00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:53,040
of the doctor container so it will set

00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,510
up log in to ensure it goes to stood out

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,330
it'll bind on the correct port for

00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:00,040
listening to connections all those sorts

00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,750
of things will all have been all be done

00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,480
for you but after that you don't have to

00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:08,740
provide the options you need to tell you

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:12,390
where your app is and the life cycle so

00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:15,610
relieved is that you can dig around here

00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm not on the Capri code there's lots

00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:20,380
of other things such my my builder can

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,080
do which the Dallas can't do which i

00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,000
think is more useful being figured for

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,190
environment variables and change there

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,990
is nice like that our mud whiskey

00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,030
Express still has an auto really low so

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:38,050
you can enable that if you still want to

00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:45,370
do my protégée any questions I talked

00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:46,930
through fast didn't I so I i had a

00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,940
should when I came over here sees my

00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:50,560
Australian accent has does cause

00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,520
confusion for some people at the whole

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,640
truth in the study France or also have

00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:00,520
all through me so I whiskey in my case

00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,220
with mod whiskey express it because it's

00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:07,060
actually here starting apache and apache

00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:09,280
can handles saddle files very well ten

00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:12,160
yes it so what'll happen is that you can

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,830
point as a directory of static files the

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,650
Apache part will do that and your Park

00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:19,220
and web will have

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,840
haven't handled by mod whiskey and if

00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,710
you're familiar with my brisket is two

00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,880
modes as an embedded mode and a demon

00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:28,760
demon mayor is always the one you should

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,410
use even though it's not the default but

00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:46,730
mod whiskey express will always use been

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:47,960
in there for you thanks Graham ok that's

00:42:46,730 --> 00:43:00,260
that drink up there if you want to

00:42:47,960 --> 00:43:03,020
quickly write down just on the box or

00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:08,920

tire place so you have to fiddle with

00:43:55,729 --> 00:44:12,739
the case is longer than the stadium well

this is my picture so if you reduce my

00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:22,160

for living I work as a developer

00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,560

I do demos warships talks conferences

00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:52,130
blogs and father we travel a lot every

00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,870
day on the road but the good thing about

00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,240
troubling is that will drink beer we

00:52:53,870 --> 00:53:00,040
make people nice people and we are in

00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,040
countries with nice weather not this one

00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:06,980
okay let's go to the top I wanted what

00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:09,680
we wanted I wanted was an open shift in

00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:14,360
the vm in a vm for doing my talks

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:17,180
conferences workshops whatever ok so i

00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,800
start i started doing some research on

00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,540
what was available when i joined the

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,180
team because i'm very new to the team

00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,490
I'm only here for six months and I start

00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:28,370
doing some research what was available

00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:31,880
at that time there was a whole lot of

00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:34,850
options so I start I went through all of

00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:38,530
these options the first place to look of

00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:41,390
course it was the official origin and

00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:44,090
repository they have a paper and file to

00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:47,210
allow you to create an idea it was

00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,610
community version it was maintained

00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:52,670
obviously continuously they are working

00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:56,450
on it so it's always up to date but for

00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:58,670
me it had some coins so it only set up

00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:01,490
the BM so there was a lot of manual

00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:03,560
steps to do in order to have a full open

00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,420
shaped origin the end working out

00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,640
process working it was not easy to

00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:09,620
update there's a lot of scripts that

00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,900
they are here in hack directory and

00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:14,900
there is a lot of stuff that wasn't

00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,850
simple we need some connection to access

00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,470
Lord to your application and there

00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,780
wasn't too much documentation why

00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,390
because engineers don't like to document

00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,160
so they know how to work why because

00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:27,590
they chat in the IRC they know each

00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,420
other they sit beside one the other day

00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:32,270
know how it worked but for external

00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:37,160
consumption emotion issue there is

00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:40,220
another another and BM or or effort to

00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:42,110
create a VM that's also from red hat

00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,760
which is the container development kit

00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:46,730
that is something that we are creating

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,730
to allow developers to interact with

00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:51,710
with open ship as we are developer

00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:53,540
evangelist we want to develop

00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,310
to work it with offensive so this seemed

00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,400
like the best approach or the best

00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:00,680
option for us but one of the pros it's

00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,770
one of the process that is a pool events

00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,960
is ready to work it's usually up to date

00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:07,880
but on the con side is the Enterprise

00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,589
version so we couldn't use it why

00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,380
because the interpretation is not meant

00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:15,349
to you'll be used anywhere for free or

00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:18,740
give it away easy for customers who paid

00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:22,190
it that's not really true but that's for

00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:25,220
less it's not yet there so they are

00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:27,980
working on creating this so it didn't

00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:30,410
fit my needs so so i looked at the

00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:33,260
community version for the same why

00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:35,480
because as we are red-hot we open we

00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,680
develop everything upstream first and

00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,950
then we create the enterprise version

00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:42,470
out of it to sell its commercial so the

00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:47,119
this atomic developer vendor was the

00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:49,070
upstream version of the city came as a

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,320
probe it was the community version of

00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:53,990
course that means that it was more

00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,150
suitable to use it was the full image

00:55:53,990 --> 00:56:00,020
ready to work up to the montane

00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:01,880
documented but it has some things that I

00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:05,200
didn't like like it requires some

00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:09,020
vagrant plugins to set up for DNS for

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:12,020
setting up VPN and it was also it's also

00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:13,849
a multi-purpose project that means that

00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,710
is not only for open seat but is for a

00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:17,660
setup project that we are creating in

00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:20,980
Red Hat I cataumet enterprise platform

00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:23,990
near the cool and something and so I

00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:27,140
didn't I didn't think that it was Taylor

00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:30,320
only for open shift so we start digging

00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:32,450
more there were more demo environments

00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,040
available they're out there created by

00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:36,380
probably redhead consultants that

00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,230
whenever they go to customers they have

00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:41,990
to create their own staff there were no

00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:43,460
pros from most of this why because it

00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:46,160
was the enterprise version they were

00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:49,369
only they were not maintained once they

00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,710
would the guy did it and every time you

00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:54,080
release count they didn't maintain oh so

00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:56,869
it was an eruption and there was another

00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,430
thing that look really cool at the

00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:00,470
beginning which is open shift in a

00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:04,030
container that's developed by rent an

00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:05,950
engineer and it's community version

00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:09,370
was really cool why because you have a

00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:14,050
rind as a single common so this oh oh I

00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:16,690
NC o-- ANC or ink and you up or run and

00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:19,390
then you have an opposite installation

00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:22,360
but the pro the cone was that it wasn't

00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:25,090
it wasn't using a vm so that's something

00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,950
to test on your host I don't want people

00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:29,530
to pull it you're their host that's one

00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:31,180
of the main reasons and also when does

00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,730
it didn't work of course because of that

00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:35,740
it was written go it was an easy to

00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:38,500
understand so that wasn't an option for

00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:41,170
us and then we have the public aid which

00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:44,380
is a another upstream project from from

00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:46,540
rain hat but this one it was really cool

00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:49,030
it's really good we had with poorer

00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,440
getting started with open its

00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,300
community version and there is a lot of

00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,940
documentation but then you have

00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,890
fabricated on top which is not what we

00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:59,050
want this a show so we wanted to show up

00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:01,780
and and fabricated started adding a

00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:05,050
lot of stuff cool stuff to be honest but

00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:08,440
that's not what I wanted to to show so

00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:10,840
none of these work for me what really

00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,780
when I say me I'm saying it didn't work

00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,300
for the team at work and to be honest it

00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:18,520
didn't work for just one guy who is the

00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,700
guy that talks the most and always

00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,840
complains and you just saw him talking

00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,870
still you don't really give you sure

00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,880
yeah yeah but I'm promoting you so if

00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:31,390
you want to follow him he's very chatty

00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,850
on the on the on Twitter that don't

00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:35,560
follow me i only have 38 followers don't

00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:38,770
do it I don't say anything interesting

00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:41,260
that's why I promote my colleagues what

00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:44,460
we wanted so we wanted after doing this

00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:47,110
research I had with a pretty

00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:52,390
understanding of what i was looking for

00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:54,010
to create an avian for us so I wanted to

00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:55,600
be based on the community version of

00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:57,910
open shift because we are developer

00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:02,170
advocates we are we want to promote the

00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:04,420
vanity version I wanted to have the

00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:07,420
process that builds this VN I wanted to

00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:09,370
be open source so to be is it accessible

00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,770
for everyone so if you want to just

00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:14,590
change and adapt to your needs we

00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:16,510
already had we want to be open source

00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,790
and allows you to modify whatever you

00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:19,250
have

00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:22,130
I wanted to be too to keep it up today

00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:25,360
so that means that with every release we

00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:28,850
wanted to be able to have it to release

00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,890
11 new version of this VM it's not only

00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:34,640
the process that we are following to

00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:36,890
build this the same vm that is

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,920
continually updated arcade up today but

00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:43,940
then out of this vm we are creating and

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,970
the package p.m. that we ship or would

00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:49,250
promote in our open shift 04 / PM side

00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:52,790
so that's the official DM that will

00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:55,220
promote as a as a community version we

00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:57,410
wanted to be easy to understand so that

00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,150
anybody that looked at the truth could

00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:01,550
understand it so we didn't want to base

00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:04,640
it on go or any other language that was

01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:06,230
really complex we want it to be flexible

01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,960
option so whenever you create the end

01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:12,650
the vm it could suit your needs so if

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,980
you want to do things like certain or

01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:18,320
install a different branch of the code

01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:20,450
you can do it easily if you do if you

01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,670
wanted to add additional capabilities to

01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,980
the vm it was easy to do it so we

01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:27,140
created or at least we think we have

01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:29,330
created it in a flexible way that allows

01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,830
you to provide with more capabilities or

01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:34,040
just the capabilities that you want for

01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:37,010
the vm it's pocketable that means that

01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,590
we create the box that we ship in horry

01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,970
in open zip code or we ship it with this

01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:44,290
process were created with this process

01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:46,760
hood that we eat our own dog food okay

01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:48,410
we wanted to have the ability to peek

01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,900
into features and progress that means

01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:53,570
that we talk constantly with engineers

01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,790
that they are developing in origin but

01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,980
the only way the only way to look at

01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:01,130
whatever they have done is to build the

01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:03,320
latest code on the orange inside the

01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,210
ring inside or even a branch they are

01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,810
working and they are trying to do a pull

01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:11,900
request or merge support request inter

01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:13,430
you need to do to build that and to

01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,380
create our install an open shift

01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:17,450
installation out of that and that's

01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:20,300
really a hard process so we wanted to

01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,090
just look at what they have done so if

01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,500
we have any comment to make on the

01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:26,540
developer experience out of it we could

01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,090
make it before it really gets into the

01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,580
prime

01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:33,520
to have the ability to pick up that's

01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:36,160
the world yes said we wanted to be able

01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,920
to build it whenever we wanted so that

01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,230
means that it's just a matter of all I I

01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:44,620
need to build an inversion you just run

01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:46,390
the bill commands it is it's wrapped

01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:50,170
with vagrant and you just have an

01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:53,140
updated version of course if you are

01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:55,270
building open ship it will move a big

01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,280
internet connection to pull down a lot a

01:01:55,270 --> 01:02:00,970
lot of things out of the internet so i

01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:03,790
don't i don't recommend to do it here

01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:07,000
today but that's it you can build

01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:09,700
anything anyway that's why i will show

01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,440
you some how it's being built but i will

01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:15,430
use a video and that's because the

01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,440
internet connection here sucks also it

01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:20,230
takes more time that it should with a

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,670
video i can slide fast forward and we

01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:24,190
wanted to be usable in different house

01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:26,680
wine because developers most of the

01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:29,290
developers easily use windows maybe not

01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,060
in this room but usually use windows so

01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:36,910
we wanted to be m to be usable in

01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:40,810
windows in mac or in linux so here i am

01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:44,890
presenting our own version or your

01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:47,350
Instagram yeah I've we're changing it is

01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,780
a CC up as doing a bigger gap once you

01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:52,540
do make an appt and wait for a while you

01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:55,540
get a full vm ready to work with open

01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:57,180
ship in it there is no additional

01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:59,830
plugins required so that means that

01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:01,540
apart form from vagrant and of course

01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:03,550
the virtualization technology that you

01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:05,860
are using whether it's a virtual box or

01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:07,780
a little bit you don't require anything

01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,700
else there is no additional plugins

01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,210
required you will need anything for dns

01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:14,290
setup you don't need anything for

01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:17,470
configuring different technologies or

01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,750
whatever just vagrant there is no

01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:22,690
fanciful resurrection we are using the

01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,730
service see file which is a hosted

01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:26,890
online service so we use this service to

01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:29,890
be able to access out the applications

01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:32,740
that you develop on openshift that means

01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:35,800
that is not suitable for working fully

01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:37,810
disconnected or not completing so you

01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,130
will not be able to access the final

01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,809
application you will be able to access

01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:45,349
to develop applications on top of

01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:47,749
opens it but it works very easily and

01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:50,719
there is no configuration configuration

01:03:47,749 --> 01:03:54,289
so it's fully configured for you you

01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:56,269
don't require to do anything but on an

01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:59,959
ax and it's also fully maintained and

01:03:56,269 --> 01:04:03,259
support by me and by the community that

01:03:59,959 --> 01:04:05,509
I hope it will become we have a lot of

01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:07,880
provisioning options that means that if

01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:10,339
you want to customize things like the

01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,869
origin red bull or branch to use let's

01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:14,630
say that there is an engineer Mike

01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:16,880
McHale 40 and he's done something and

01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:20,150
you see his pull request you want to

01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,209
test it so you just create the American

01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:25,640
vagrant image or read provision the

01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:29,869
vagrant image with our repo and you test

01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:32,839
his puter plus we can set up the vm v

01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:35,359
MIP so if usually we ship with one eyed

01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:38,089
pea but if it conflicts with whatever

01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:40,849
Network you are in you can change it up

01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:44,329
to your needs and then all the ship I oh

01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:47,539
and all this stuff will get configure

01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:49,729
related to the IP you configured it

01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:51,679
configures also the open ship domain or

01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:54,439
the applications that means that you can

01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,390
provide whatever name whatever domain

01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:58,069
you want for the applications and it

01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,569
allows you to specify what additional

01:04:58,069 --> 01:05:01,999
capabilities you want to add to the mix

01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:03,469
we'll see what are we working on what

01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:05,569
additional capabilities were working on

01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:07,519
but there is a lot of set of things so

01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:10,249
you can you can have a base image and

01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:12,140
then you can have space image created

01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:15,679
with a lot of stuff in it that's a

01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:17,839
little too open city itself we have

01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,759
rental options which run tarnishes you

01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:22,130
have we have memory and CPU that's it

01:05:19,759 --> 01:05:24,589
you need to specify a minute that means

01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:27,319
that if you create a VM and you package

01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:30,349
it and you provide it to anybody the the

01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:33,229
vm will work just by itself it will be a

01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:35,420
very small vagrant fire and they just

01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:38,150
need to tailor to memory and CPU to

01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:40,999
residents works with libertine beautiful

01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:44,119
box because we wanted to be able to run

01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:48,589
in different with different post for

01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:51,349
windows linux and mac users and it's a

01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:53,900
scripting bus that means that it should

01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:54,960
be easy for anybody to understand to

01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:59,970
tweak to

01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:02,010
modify adapt whatever they need I have

01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:04,859
middleware background and that's also

01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:07,380
one reason because I chose bus and not

01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:09,869
any other thing more complex like Perl

01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:15,240
Python go whatever other scripted

01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:18,480
nervous I think there is the creation of

01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:23,310
the vm follows four simple steps which

01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:26,640
is configure the oldest a year configure

01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:29,099
the locker layer configure the origin

01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,880
layer and then provide with anything

01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:34,859
additional on top of that on the OS you

01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,780
install all you can configure all the

01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:38,910
base packages that you want we provide

01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:41,070
the minimum you can of course tailored

01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:43,020
to your needs and we try to make the

01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:46,050
image as small as possible so with

01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:49,589
things that are tunable in size or that

01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:51,570
can grow in time with in size as we

01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:53,310
learn we try to limit them like the

01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:54,570
journal side so we provide with a very

01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,310
small journal science because a

01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:59,190
developer usually will not look at the

01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:01,260
journal so the thing is that once you

01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:04,020
have a vm working probably journalist

01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,670
starts growing on your vm starts

01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,490
behaving it's longer that's the word on

01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:11,609
the dog on the doctor n we just

01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:13,770
configured locker and we started one

01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:17,760
thing that we do is because we are using

01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:21,839
as long as a local and environment we

01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:24,990
are using the loopback file system

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:27,599
because it's the easier one to set up we

01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:29,910
limit the size for this loop back from

01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,130
file system for the containers so it

01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:36,180
doesn't grow as much as your vm and it

01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:40,080
doesn't get to a point where you cannot

01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:43,260
use the vm anymore then on the Iranian

01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:45,630
it's as easy as go to the earning ripple

01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:48,359
whatever you have there and check it out

01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:50,190
check out or update if you already have

01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:53,369
it with the latest work that's up that's

01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:56,640
in there in the red phone build it then

01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:58,920
configure origin then start it so you

01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,010
have the food vm with it started and

01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:05,110
then add some services and um like the

01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:07,480
open ship registry the router

01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:10,240
some templates so whatever is required

01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:14,770
to have a minimal installation ready to

01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:17,800
use for or by developers and then we

01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:19,690
have an additional script that will grow

01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,220
within time that it will provide with

01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:22,990
additional capabilities to this base

01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:25,300
installation things like the matrix

01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:27,250
maybe you don't think the matrix at all

01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,810
because you are a developer so you can

01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:31,090
select whether you want to install it to

01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:32,710
have your vm with it or not the logging

01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:34,690
capabilities there is a centralized

01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:37,120
logging capabilities that's using the

01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:40,240
elca stack you may want to have it in

01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,950
your installation or not because as you

01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,500
are things to the installation the vm

01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:47,680
will get bigger the installation will

01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,180
run slower some templates so we have

01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,400
been the enterprise version of the

01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:52,990
templates if you want to use it for Des

01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,960
Moines in the enterprise that's fine

01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:58,150
also there is some work in progress to

01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,650
add to add some additional users with

01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:03,370
different capabilities with different

01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:06,070
roles and also you can test things with

01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:08,170
different roles to show persistent

01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:11,170
podium capabilities using the NFL so

01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:14,320
we'll set up on NFS server engine in the

01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:16,660
BM and then it also allows you to cass

01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,870
or to pull down all the images so every

01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:21,400
time that you want to work everything is

01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:23,680
already in your vm and you don't have to

01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:27,340
wait for different images to pull down

01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:31,150
from the internet and bonus we have some

01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:33,070
scripts that we are using to show open

01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:35,980
shift that we also put in there so if

01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:39,010
you want to let's say so or try with the

01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:40,600
nexus installation ready to work in an

01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:42,820
open safe environment there is a script

01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,040
that it will just you just have to run

01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:47,440
it and it will install a nexus instance

01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,090
in your environment and we are a lot of

01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,950
the demos and they start that we do

01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:59,700
we'll put it in there so you can just

01:09:50,950 --> 01:10:04,500
try it so now I have two videos and

01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:15,720
one it shows how to create a how to

01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:18,900
create them then the end from scratch so

01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:20,370
I just pull down my my github repo and I

01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,560
do a bit going about I don't have to do

01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:24,870
anything else and this will start doing

01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,480
following all the provisioning process

01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:29,460
so it's creating and using the word for

01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,870
this one and it's grating I'm just

01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,360
taking that I don't have anything

01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:35,490
running on that IP and it's running all

01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,860
the scriptures i will just you'll see

01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:40,260
that it updates fedora it installs

01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:44,910
docker blood around it this takes some

01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:48,300
time then we see that it's executing so

01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:50,970
all this fancy numbers are for then all

01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:54,120
the scripts that are run whenever then

01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:56,490
they are run by a gun-happy numbers and

01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:58,770
then you'll see the traditional feeds on

01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:01,050
them so we are cloning origin we're

01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:04,230
building origin and when we have created

01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:06,150
the service and then we are varied in

01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:10,830
the router whenever the various

01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:11,940
templates that are guitar and after we

01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:14,550
are installing some additional

01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:16,110
capabilities and after we win stole all

01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:18,150
the additional capabilities the

01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:20,750
installation will be up and running will

01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:23,700
happen or Dean up and running in minutes

01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:26,250
I have a decent internet connection at

01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:29,940
home so this for me takes something like

01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:32,000
six minutes to build from nothing to a

01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:35,610
full open internet installation

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,830
building from source code and to be

01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:40,440
honest the most time it takes is to miss

01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:42,930
whole Locker and to build origin then

01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:45,600
this is the installation that you have

01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:47,880
as you can see there you have the IP

01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,510
that I'm accessing the BM is the this

01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,920
already preset values and I'm going to

01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:58,920
create an application and I'm going to

01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:01,430
and it's showing also what's the URL to

01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:04,930
access that application using the and

01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:07,660
domain for application that i provided

01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:11,290
time which is the default one so this is

01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:14,460
creating a PHP sample application with

01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:14,460
the sample repository

01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:30,420
it's feeling it you can see the logs how

01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:32,219
it builds the application and then do

01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,230
you see that it's already been built and

01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:39,719
then we can access the application and

01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:42,480
this is here this is the where your

01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:44,250
applications will be exposed and this is

01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,440
why you require an internet connection

01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:49,039
but at the end if you are using or

01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:51,420
building something in origin you will

01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:52,889
require an internet connection because

01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,719
you will be pulling down dependencies

01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:56,280
probably for your application so that's

01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,889
something that we assume it was

01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:05,520
something required would prefer to use

01:12:58,889 --> 01:13:07,940
this way and now I don't know what's

01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,940
doing now

01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:16,590
and now we see that we have in this da

01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:19,560
it's doing it again this is the

01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:21,960
application itself and then what we see

01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,220
here is that it also has the metrics

01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,020
capabilities so that's something

01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:26,700
additional usually nothing installed by

01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,890
default if you want to see the matrix

01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,630
because you are you the application that

01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:32,250
you want to you are developing you want

01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:34,230
to have this kind of ability you can

01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:36,000
just study and then you can just log in

01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:38,610
with the regular come online to the vm

01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:42,110
and it will just work with the OC client

01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:50,610
as some of you have seen in previous

01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:55,830
workshops this morning okay and there is

01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:59,370
the reason there is in this other option

01:13:55,830 --> 01:14:03,570
when you want you have a raid your you

01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:06,240
have a raid your vm created but you just

01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:08,760
want to test some capabilities we don't

01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,890
need to go again and create the vm again

01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,710
from scratch because that will take a

01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:16,410
lot of time so you just run the

01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:20,030
provisioning step with the vm so this is

01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:20,030
another video that i have

01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:30,769
so what I do is I was looking at this

01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:33,289
pull request from viviano France poor

01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:37,309
condition for a new feature that was

01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:39,800
going to go into the product so it this

01:14:37,309 --> 01:14:41,869
feature what it does it's a darn about

01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,399
box here that it will allow you to

01:14:41,869 --> 01:14:45,709
download the client from the from the

01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:48,860
web console so I wanted to test it how

01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:52,939
do I test you I just read provision by

01:14:48,860 --> 01:15:00,260
the vm with the ripple user name of the

01:14:52,939 --> 01:15:01,969
waivers glyndon comment on the branch so

01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:03,499
this is something that you'll get in the

01:15:01,969 --> 01:15:04,909
pool no question whenever you are

01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,800
watching to a pull request you will get

01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:09,289
this this information and you yes

01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,869
parkland provision instead of a nerd up

01:15:09,289 --> 01:15:15,999
because your your box is already running

01:15:11,869 --> 01:15:21,969
you just say okay let's reprovision this

01:15:15,999 --> 01:15:21,969
it takes some time that i will skip

01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:38,100
so once you access is Vivian you can see

01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:41,469
what he's done ok this is this is

01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:43,570
whatever is done so this is a way of

01:15:41,469 --> 01:15:45,969
having the latest and greatest or

01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:53,980
checking whatever you want to check off

01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:56,920
what the first half done so during this

01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:59,199
process at the beginning I told you what

01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:02,140
things we needed what were the

01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:04,090
requirement that we needed for the vm we

01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:07,420
want it to be open source so this is

01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:09,250
this is hosted on github so you can use

01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:12,219
it an access and then tune it and modify

01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:13,719
it what we wanted it to be based on the

01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:16,510
community version that's using the

01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:19,060
origin want it to be maintained up to

01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:21,520
date it's maintained up today because we

01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:23,920
are using it to create our own vm so

01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:26,770
that's why we are keeping it up today we

01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,890
have some we have to provide this level

01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:32,140
of quality it's easy to understand

01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:33,880
because it's written in pass it's

01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:35,980
flexible in provisional option although

01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,160
I know you don't have a lot amount of

01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:41,530
frozen option but is you can do some for

01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,900
listening you can package it so there is

01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:45,910
some one way from once you create this

01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:49,360
installation we can just do a vagrant

01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:51,610
box package and create with the v n1

01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,190
p.m. that you can reduce with everything

01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:57,730
that we have set so it's it will just

01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:59,980
create it start with with the vm fully

01:16:57,730 --> 01:17:04,179
configured that's what we do for the

01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:10,390
open sea 4pm you can you can look into

01:17:04,179 --> 01:17:12,429
features in progress oh i just so-so and

01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:14,679
you can build it whatever you want and

01:17:12,429 --> 01:17:17,410
we can use it in different hosts so

01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:19,570
check it out please it's the reason

01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:23,290
there is a that's the link to the ripple

01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:25,980
or use the package version I don't worry

01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:28,750
drizzling to the first light at the end

01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:30,640
where you can get all the presentation

01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:33,130
links to the videos and everything so

01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,080
use use the package version if you want

01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:36,289
that's our version in the open sea of

01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:39,469
our side

01:17:36,289 --> 01:17:42,159
and red or red the deus ex dogs so for

01:17:39,469 --> 01:17:44,959
the vm that we provide in the origin

01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:47,839
site we also provide with the land

01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:50,269
something similar to what one grant has

01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:54,289
done in there during the morning that

01:17:50,269 --> 01:17:58,069
can help you work through all the usage

01:17:54,289 --> 01:18:00,919
of open ship of creating an application

01:17:58,069 --> 01:18:02,269
hooking one of the one application link

01:18:00,919 --> 01:18:04,369
in one application with the database

01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:06,859
deploying templates once templates and

01:18:04,369 --> 01:18:11,030
all this stuff so don't kill me if you

01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:14,539
don't like it guys do some pull requests

01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:17,329
to meet issues help us make it better or

01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:19,669
it's just don't use it of course thank

01:18:17,329 --> 01:18:22,760
you for for listening me to me and if

01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:25,429
you have questions thus now is the time

01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:28,189
for them and if you want this

01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:29,689
presentation it's there so this is the

01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:31,639
only thing that you really care because

01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:41,059
of all the other things are are in there

01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:43,549
thank you there's no questions ok good

01:18:41,059 --> 01:18:45,949
how you do the liquid provider because

01:18:43,549 --> 01:18:49,489
on the link there's only VirtualBox

01:18:45,949 --> 01:18:52,969
provider what if we don't we don't

01:18:49,489 --> 01:18:55,069
provide yet the package vm for liver we

01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:56,659
are working on that but if you are using

01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:58,369
the liberal provide or do you want to

01:18:56,659 --> 01:19:00,709
use the liquid provided yes clone the

01:18:58,369 --> 01:19:03,049
github repo on the grant app you will

01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:04,879
have not long as you have the liver

01:19:03,049 --> 01:19:07,129
configured for making it it will work

01:19:04,879 --> 01:19:10,519
does it I think we have an issue filed

01:19:07,129 --> 01:19:12,619
for for that particularly hopefully yeah

01:19:10,519 --> 01:19:15,349
we have an issue to publish the vm with

01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:18,260
labor on the orange inside it works you

01:19:15,349 --> 01:19:21,319
to make the vm now that Jorge has made

01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:24,139
this script it basically all I do make

01:19:21,319 --> 01:19:27,079
that vm honestly if I run this script I

01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:29,659
do a little bit of like cleaning of file

01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:31,610
systems with like writing it all to bank

01:19:29,659 --> 01:19:34,070
so that they can compress

01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:37,610
which is it I Ching and iming a new

01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:39,830
favorite file and that's it yeah various

01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:41,719
instructions on the rain may file so if

01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:45,159
you go to the report this instruction on

01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:49,630
how to create your own pockets personal

01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:57,530
right liquid yes what's your maintenance

01:19:49,630 --> 01:20:00,619
policy against probably when I will use

01:19:57,530 --> 01:20:04,670
the master I always get something given

01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:08,840
you yeah and you will continuously go to

01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:11,239
the next or the master of authorship

01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,000
yeah but I if I wanted something more

01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:17,119
stable like cotton sheet or something

01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,940
like that range so this is this is

01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:21,409
already this is not enterprise on 302 is

01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:23,810
the version for the enterprise but it

01:20:21,409 --> 01:20:25,369
relates to some personal for you the

01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:27,500
thing is that what we are doing is

01:20:25,369 --> 01:20:29,179
because we are maintaining it we are

01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:33,050
keeping it up-to-date to the newest

01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:36,320
releases so probably within time if you

01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:39,230
and if you want to use like last year's

01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:45,860
origin you'll have to go back in commit

01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:47,570
for last year's yes like what it is if

01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:50,510
you navigate in half there is a releases

01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:52,580
if you think you have you'll see what 30

01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:54,889
releases or something about the

01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:57,230
Correspondents hands so basically it I

01:20:54,889 --> 01:21:00,020
go when i'm building the all-in-one vm

01:20:57,230 --> 01:21:02,570
take on origin I go into his script and

01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:05,270
hideous script to get an environment

01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:08,239
variable for what tag you can set both

01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:12,889
the repo and you can set the bags or

01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:14,780
branch okay so i can find all that what

01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:17,480
will you be doing that's something that

01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:19,250
it's good that we had their session

01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,350
because we'll get some ideas right now

01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:23,960
it's only it's there is only one master

01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:25,760
branch but what we will be doing every

01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,010
release that we publish on the Orion

01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,869
inside we will tie it so you can go back

01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:32,090
to that official version i'll use the

01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:34,159
one dot one dot one release are already

01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:37,850
right now if you just clone the origin

01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:40,520
sign you can run master or you can just

01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:43,370
specify as i did when i did for this

01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:45,920
brand you can say origin point

01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:49,160
origin brands they can walk on walk on

01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,020
one and you'll have to wonder one to one

01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,210
version the only thing is that it will

01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:59,360
not get it from the package version it

01:21:53,210 --> 01:22:01,880
will build it for you no we are not

01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:13,100
using onto boylston there's yeah there

01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:17,380
is a vm spores or is as far as i know

01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:24,290
that some of only for fedora 23 roberts

01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:26,930
fork okay then so here's the deal will

01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:28,880
remember one of his points was we as the

01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:31,100
evangelist one of the test features when

01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:36,680
they were going in your rpm solution

01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:38,480
doesn't work for us but that doesn't

01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:41,750
matter because i can't go and then say

01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:44,510
uh McConnell has got a new he's testing

01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:47,150
a new feature I want to actually I want

01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:49,730
but I didn't even want tip I want me

01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:51,680
Kyle branch where he's checking in all

01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:54,260
sorts of stuff that might be broken this

01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:56,960
script is generic enough it builds from

01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:58,700
source right so we don't want the RPMs

01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,830
because we want to build from source so

01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:03,020
we either built in my case and I build

01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:05,330
the all-in-one p.m. I built from a tag

01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,370
version that was released like v1 dot

01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:09,080
one dot one and then I can link that

01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:11,090
decline so when i'm testing new kind of

01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:13,760
stuff i want to build from his source

01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:15,710
tree to build it all of a great image so

01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:18,290
the RPM we don't use rpms or anything

01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:19,940
package we don't use ansible none of

01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:23,330
that stuff so this is this is something

01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:26,120
that we created for us because we had an

01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:28,640
in that's the whole presentation was our

01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:31,520
I mean okay and probably it's not the

01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,220
best way we are not engineers we are not

01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:36,470
doing the proper approach but we had a

01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:39,080
solution that work for us if it works

01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:40,910
for you which are gases plane then find

01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:42,890
use it if it doesn't work just whatever

01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:44,870
you want if you do want no

01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:47,210
and people we have a separate set of

01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:48,920
leaders for for staging of the cluster

01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:52,460
of machines but that's a different

01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:54,490
rebook yeah it's available and the point

01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:57,050
of this also is not to set up a cluster

01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:59,090
appointed a dozen all of in what 10 vm

01:23:57,050 --> 01:24:00,980
that runs everything you want that you

01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:03,110
can easily just do stuff with you don't

01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:05,390
get into all that gns up it's just one

01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:12,380
vm running it acts like an entire

01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:15,010
certain more questions then you are

01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,010
really for me

01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,420
Regina

01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:29,210
that is my

01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:53,989
is not a potato potato so I really work

01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:53,989
as you can type am I

01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:31,700
don't worry that's made it to your yahoo

01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:35,180
but the situation is synchronized by a

01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:45,920
position text alert it usually take a

01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:48,920
good Michelle balances are doing a post

01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:54,190
about a beggar and brush miss you so

01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:59,870
much so much in there see I attack you

01:27:54,190 --> 01:28:02,830
right yeah here's my man when I want to

01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:02,830
actually boy

01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:12,100
reto the question and a dummy my

01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:19,140
gettable movie is very much lower the

01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:32,860
next stage on having been in the top

01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:37,110
yeah thank you for my this is the

01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:40,660
ansible installer just set up your

01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:44,890
google compute engine or monday Warren's

01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:46,690
bare metal if you have a cluster of you

01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:49,570
can have something called an inventory

01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:52,720
viola just as a list of IP addresses and

01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:54,610
as long as you have a valid SSH key set

01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:57,400
it to access it will go look into all

01:28:54,610 --> 01:29:01,770
the ip's use ansible to provision of a

01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:07,570
cluster of maybe 10 machines so I ran a

01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:09,100
command is there a kind of the local

01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:10,760
environment but would be paid by my

01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:15,130
hoochie coochie

01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:19,219
a simple are you betting site if if I

01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:21,679
the best way to do that once you have if

01:29:19,219 --> 01:29:26,659
you've already built an image then you

01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:30,050
just do dr. push okay yet yeah and then

01:29:26,659 --> 01:29:33,050
hopefully the you have an image stream

01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:35,210
that runs in the fire aidonia trying the

01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:37,250
new team arrives giving a scan the

01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:42,170
deployment waiting for us all that

01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:44,659
effects and then possibly a floor so

01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:47,719
something for CI by your stitching is

01:29:44,659 --> 01:29:50,599
all go deployed for production I make me

01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:53,150
play Anjali press the button annually

01:29:50,599 --> 01:29:56,000
develop reproduction but whatever I have

01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:59,300
a safe time right and forbidding the

01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,969
image that's good oh come on well we

01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:06,050
already had oh yeah yeah 12 I'd use open

01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:10,550
ship to build it locally side I I could

01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:14,840
use OC sink into the environment or I

01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:17,230
could actually enterprise you place to

01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,870
go yeah I know

01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:22,810
if I was using a hosted environment I

01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:26,350
could just do a git push to get hub

01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:28,060
night hub would listen yeah listen for

01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:30,280
that hook that would do a build in the

01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:35,050
cloud and it would should produce the

01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:38,290
same image right it should right really

01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:44,500
yes yes yes but on the other hand I

01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:47,350
could have a base builder image no yoga

01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:49,480
they build in staging is on rel right

01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:52,420
maybe they don't want to pay too many

01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:55,000
real licenses i gets into Wes here rel

01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:57,580
in the cloud right I still can build

01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,590
docker images i can push and hold upper

01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:02,440
images based on sent to Wes but when

01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:07,150
they go to production it's rough right

01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:09,550
so nice to have a different ways of

01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:14,140
producing the images and allowing people

01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:16,900
to enforce a standard base or for

01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:18,430
compliance and consistency across your

01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:21,150
environment

01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:21,150
thanks

01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:38,030
was

01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:03,330
ah

01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:11,730
should we prepare something before or US

01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:11,730
government to see your eyes

01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,310
