good morning everyone

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,040
welcome to devgonf my name is elon

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,840
muernick and i work for synopsis

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,840
where i manage r d for the seeker agents

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,160
seeker in case you haven't heard about

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,199
it

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,840
or haven't heard about it yet is

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
probably the best iest tool out there

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
today

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,400
but as fascinating as iest can be

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,279
i only have five minutes so this is the

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,920
last time i'm going to mention it

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,200
i want to start with a quick recap of

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,880
what's going on

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,480
in the world for those of you who

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
weren't paying attention

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,160
so as you may notice by the fact that

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,840
devconf is

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,480
virtual this year we are under a global

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,719
pandemic and

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
most companies or at least most software

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,680
companies

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,000
have closed their office and moved

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,559
everyone to work from home

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,199
this of course includes people like me

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,360
who

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
never thought about working from home

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,559
full time

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,079
and never wanted to work from home full

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,519
time

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:09,040
so when i when i understood

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,040
this was really happening i went out and

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
googled what does this mean for me as a

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
manager

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,200
and i found all sorts of suggestions

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
like

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,119
having virtual coffee breaks with people

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,720
or having

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,520
once a day or twice a day even things by

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
video call or even someone went as far

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,000
as suggesting having your camera open

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,759
all the time having the entire team do

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
this and that way

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,000
everyone can see everyone else's face

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
and you kind of get the feeling like

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,320
you're back in the office

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,399
this to me to be honest is really weird

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,759
the world is different now and why would

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,040
we work

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,680
very hard to make the world look like it

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
used to instead of except the world is

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
right now

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,920
a bit different and modify our behavior

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,360
to suit it now this approach

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,240
has in my eyes two problems

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,800
first of all it assumes that everyone

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,239
can always do this which is just

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
incorrect the working from home working

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
under

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,800
this pandemic adds a whole lot of

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
new restrictions to a lot of people some

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
people have

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
health issues and if not them sometimes

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
though

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
family members have and they need to

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,319
take care of them

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,239
some people find that they need to do a

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,120
lot more things around the house

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
than they're used to because suddenly

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,760
everyone is

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,640
a time and you need to be your kids

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,959
main caregiver teacher and everything

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,959
else

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,239
and even if none of this applies to you

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
some people just don't want to move back

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
to an

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,800
office-like scenario i'm

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,400
willing to bet that everyone who put up

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,239
a suggestion like

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,159
having virtual coffee or keeping your

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,640
camera always open is

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,599
first of all really smart second really

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,080
good at their job

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:13,440
and third an extrovert for an introvert

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,159
like me having your camera open adds

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,560
a whole new layer of stress because not

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,120
only are you

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360
talking to other people which is

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,799
generally stressful for introverts

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,200
you're actually opening up your home

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
your private space and in a sense

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,640
inviting your work life

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,040
into it with the camera open

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,720
suddenly you may not be comfortable

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,519
working in your pajamas

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,920
or you become self-conscious about

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,480
having to shave every morning or

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
picking up the kids toys or in my case

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,120
the cat's toys because

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,159
i don't want them in the frame so

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,120
to make a long lightning talk short

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,640
for god's sake if you don't absolutely

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,599
need your camera on

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,080
switch it off and normalize everyone

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,799
else

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
switching off the camera unless they

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,959
explicitly

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,360
really want to have it on with that

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,840
i'm done and i want to thank you for

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
