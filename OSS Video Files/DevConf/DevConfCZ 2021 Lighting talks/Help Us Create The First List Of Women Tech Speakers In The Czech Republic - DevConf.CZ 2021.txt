Description: 
	At CyberMagnolia we believe it's important for tech conferences & meetups to have diverse speakers lineups. As some of our members are community & event organizers, we know how hard it is to find ladies willing to talk about their work.

Help us create the first list of women tech speakers in the Czech Republic by recommending women whose work you appreciate and would like to hear more about at the next technology event.
