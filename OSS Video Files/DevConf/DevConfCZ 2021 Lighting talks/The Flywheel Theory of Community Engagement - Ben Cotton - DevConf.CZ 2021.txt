Description: 
	The Flywheel Theory says that the long term sustainability of a community project depends on having someone who can keep the momentum going. This is a contributor who can provide a consistent presence, which ends up being a great effort multiplier.

i want to share an idea that i call the

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
flywheel theory of community engagement

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,639
this comes from my observations

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,920
participating in various parts of the

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,400
fedora project

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,960
both as a volunteer and as a red hat

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
employee

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,680
over the past decade what is a flywheel

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
in physics it's a wheel spinning rapidly

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,000
on a low friction axis

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,199
simply put a flywheel is a machine that

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
can store energy

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
and provide a consistent energy output

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,480
when the input is inconsistent

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
in a community a flywheel also provides

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,719
a consistent energy output

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,480
this naturally helps keep teams

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,320
functioning

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,079
but why is a flywheel important well

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,680
people's contributions to open source

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,079
projects will naturally ebb

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,879
and flow the amount of free time a

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,680
person has

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,079
isn't static it will rise and fall based

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,359
on the demands of the rest of their life

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,239
work family school other organizations

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,920
and projects

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,879
illness burnout etc everyone's effort

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
goes up and down

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
on a unique frequency so long as some

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,159
people's contributions are up when

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,000
others are down

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,760
the overall momentum of the project

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
stays strong

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
but at some point your core contributors

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,159
will all independently hit a low point

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
at about the same time

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
this can have long-term effects on the

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
project

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
when momentum goes to near zero it can

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,920
be hard to get restarted

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
when existing contributors are ready to

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,079
return will the stagnation of the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,040
project cause them to find another area

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,280
or another project to contribute to

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,040
if new potential contributors come along

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,880
will someone be there to greet them and

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,200
show them around

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,240
if a newcomer does get started how long

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
do they stick around

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,399
working by themselves this doesn't

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
happen over a weekend

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
but the longer the lull lasts the harder

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,439
it will be to get the project moving

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
again so what does a community flywheel

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
do

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
a community flywheel doesn't have to be

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,399
the person who does the most work

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
they just provide a constant presence

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,720
that helps keep the momentum going

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,160
they show that the project is active by

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,640
welcoming newcomers

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,280
keeping up on regular tasks and meetings

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
and yes

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
stepping up to do work when there's

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,040
nobody else around

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
the purpose of the flywheel then is to

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
ensure that there's always effort being

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,120
put into the project

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,200
this is important because it helps keep

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
your existing contributors engaged

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,599
but even more so because it gives new

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
contributors a reason to join

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,360
it is very discouraging to send an

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,879
introduction note only to be met with

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,959
silence

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,959
joining an active team is much easier

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,879
than restarting a dormant team

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,040
so having someone be the flywheel in a

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,959
community can result in much more effort

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,840
than they put in themselves

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
it's an investment in the health of a

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
team

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,280
now i don't have any concrete numbers to

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
apply to this

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,440
it's a conceptual model at this point

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
and frankly it doesn't always hold

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,760
some teams thrive without an obvious

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
flywheel and some teams end up reducing

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,400
to just the flywheel

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,319
but in general it seems to hold up i

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,599
suspect that as little as ten percent of

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
an fte

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,159
or four hours a week can be enough to

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
help a team keep going as contributors

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,400
come and go

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
in fedora specifically i found that this

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,239
often means having a red hat employee

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
participating as part of their job

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
duties

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,560
having a paid employee isn't strictly

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,319
necessary

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,599
any community member can act as this

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
flywheel

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,879
and there are people in the fedora

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
community who are acting as a flywheel

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,519
in their teams

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,360
while participating on a completely

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,040
volunteer basis

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,799
but the advantage of having someone be

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,599
the flywheel as part of their job is

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640
that

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,080
well it's part of their job that means

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
it's easier for them to provide

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
that consistent level of effort in

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
summary

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,840
the flywheel theory says that the

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
long-term sustainability of a community

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
project

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
depends on having someone who can keep

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
the momentum going

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
this is a contributor who can provide a

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,200
consistent presence

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
which ends up being a great effort

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,799
