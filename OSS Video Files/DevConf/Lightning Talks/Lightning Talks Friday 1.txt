Oh

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,520
we're starting any 32 bits

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,140
ok so for sorry for the slight delay I

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,480
like to welcome you in the last session

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,370
of today's def conf lightning talks and

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,980
we are further ado I give the word to

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,720
shimon petka who's going to tell us

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,490
something about automated visual testing

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,440
of web applications you have your 10

00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:41,600
minutes thank you so oh hi everyone my

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,840
name is Yvonne pratica and today I am

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:50,450
too I am going to talk about a visual

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:55,190
testing for me visual testing is finding

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:58,340
visual differences between images in a

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:02,320
simplified manner in software

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:06,380
development or web development it means

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:09,470
to compare the current look of our web

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,530
application against our desired look of

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:19,850
the web application in the past it has

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:23,150
been made manually Oh s as manual visual

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:27,860
testing it can be really boring

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:30,290
time-consuming and it will just ruin

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:36,920
your day I haven't made it myself but I

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:41,650
I think that so good news we came up

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:48,680
with a software solution among other

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:51,290
among others how us how does our our

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,750
solution do the process of its visual

00:03:51,290 --> 00:04:00,950
testing well it's really simple or you

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:03,670
write an hour cuillean test after the

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:08,810
test has completed they are going to be

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:10,340
generated some screenshots and these

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,300
screenshots screenshots

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,870
are going to be compared against the

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:21,620
desired appearance of your web

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:29,060
application and the result is sent to

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:33,669
the web manager in the process of visual

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:38,900
testing you may encounter situations

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:41,900
where you somehow don't want a part of

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:47,630
the web web applications web application

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:51,010
to be compared it can be all like some

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,210
date field on the web page disclosing of

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:58,430
problems that is causing the test

00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:02,690
failures so we involved in our solution

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:06,460
masks what is a mask well mask is simply

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:10,970
the area of the image you want to ignore

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:14,539
how do you create one it's really simple

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:18,560
again all you have to do is go to the

00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:21,380
web manager and click and drag the area

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:27,740
you want to exclude from the comparison

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:30,289
process now you may you may you may be

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,470
thinking well it sounds really cool I

00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:38,450
want to get involved in visual testing

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:42,169
what do I have to do this is it you have

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:46,099
to just pass these few lines of code to

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:51,800
the archaean configuration file and it's

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:53,479
done we also have our server side of the

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,479
application hosted and deployed on

00:05:53,479 --> 00:06:03,860
openshift so really this is all you have

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:11,030
to do and get going what do we want to

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:16,880
do in the future we want to integrate

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:22,160
our project with to communicate and work

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:25,260
with Jenkins and we want to

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,910
make it or we want to scale it up

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:34,800
prepare it for for the use of the larger

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:37,650
more complex project and that's when

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,920
this gets done it's going to be is going

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:49,380
to really stand out among other products

00:06:40,920 --> 00:07:04,260
like this one so that's all from me if

00:06:49,380 --> 00:07:23,360
you have any questions yeah Oh can you

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:29,250
repeat it again yeah yeah yeah mm good

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:35,760
question oh well the the load of the

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:37,650
page is made by like the Phantom Jace

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,820
chromedriver what whatever you choose

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,530
with the arquillian settings it's not

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,190
what I'm it's not what this epic

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:50,040
application is responsible of it just it

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,160
just renders the page and wet and with

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,500
alkaline are cruelly and graphing it

00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:02,120
loads all the elements it has to do and

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,120
then it begins the process of comparison

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:35,330
yes oh it's our current graphing

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:40,520
extension oh yeah oh well yeah okay i'm

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:44,150
going to write the project name and i'm

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:47,870
just going to make sure because it's all

00:08:44,150 --> 00:09:05,410
i can write the kids or URL to to find

00:08:47,870 --> 00:09:05,410
it pretty yeah yeah yes I mean to turn

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:56,060
00 it's rough you noticed its current

00:09:36,980 --> 00:10:00,399
support from the original okay thanks

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:04,959
again for attention thank you for talk

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,959
do we have DeBarge right here

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
whatever

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,060
so it seemed everything smirk now so

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,040
i'll give you the bar sharae talking

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:26,870
about google driving gnome thank you

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:29,500
hello hey good evening so I'm going to

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,910
talk about Google Drive and genome and

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,649
apparently we have been working on this

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,589
for six years so not sure why but

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,629
hopefully as be able to talk about it so

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:43,879
I work in the Red Hat desktop theme i am

00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:46,339
rishi on freenode Eyres net I do

00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:51,769
IRC I have an email address and I

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:53,529
sometimes blog it's very easy to

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:57,620
remember Rishi is a lost case so it's

00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:59,509
very simple so the idea is to use to

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,529
expose Google Drive somehow outside of a

00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:06,920
browser inside your usual desktop native

00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:09,889
kind of applications so i am talking

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,740
about things like nautilus an image

00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:16,220
viewer may be filed I mean a PDF reader

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,920
and things like that also inside the

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,029
toolkits file chooser widget so gtk file

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,490
chooser which means that if you are

00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:26,059
writing any application with gtk it

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,699
should be also able to open stuff inside

00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:31,699
Google Drive open clothes sorry open

00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:35,170
save create new and so on and also some

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:38,000
big applications for example LibreOffice

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,459
LibreOffice also actually is supposed to

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,389
work as in work as in it should be able

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:48,829
to open a file see an ODT oro xml file

00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:52,129
on google drive safe 28 and so on so

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:54,439
this is a screenshot it's my own google

00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,440
drive account and you have I of Nome and

00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:58,510
I think

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,250
yeah and you can kind of see that it's

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,800
the same picture which is open in the

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,810
browser and also on the on the file

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,300
chooser on the file manager so not lost

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:12,310
I have no man the browser kind of works

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,900
so so six years ago in 2009 there was a

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,030
summer of code project that's when it

00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,640
started it was by this guy called T

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:21,580
balls Sonia it's a French name I think I

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,470
don't know how to say it correctly so so

00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,890
back in 2009 there was is the summer of

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,560
code project to somehow do this it it

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:32,740
went curve quite far the code was quite

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:36,330
usable but not quite there to merge it

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:39,040
so it kind of be trotted after a while

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,360
and there are some problems with Google

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,630
Drive which make it kind of hard to

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,150
actually make it work nicely we'll see

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:50,260
why later which is I think mainly white

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:54,220
kind of be trotted six years later in

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,930
2015 some things have changed so Google

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,600
Drive had a few iterations of their web

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,220
api and the servery the the the the

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,500
calls that you make to the server to

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,120
talk to it they changed and so on and a

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,760
lot of things change things or six years

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,120
but finally we were able to merge it

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,700
like after some back and forth after

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,580
some modifications of the old code like

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,260
so on and so forth so so if you are

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,920
using federal 23 it should be there I

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:24,520
hope you are losing fat or 23 and no

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:28,110
organ own 3.8 you can look it up for

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,110
your other distributions it should work

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:35,260
so it was not just me it needed reviews

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,250
and discussions and so on with a bunch

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:42,280
of people and these three people are

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:46,240
mostly involved other than me Alexander

00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,580
Philip and Andre so here's another

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,760
screenshot this time it's even working

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,790
working with I mean it's so opening a

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,910
PDF file from Nautilus and I think the

00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:01,350
same file is opened in the browser so

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,350
it's the same file

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,700
so how does it work so under the hood we

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,020
have this thing called norm online

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,480
accounts where you add the account and

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,010
then once the account is there the

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,490
application just uses standard G lib gtk

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:25,000
API like g5g volume G mount whatever G

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:27,250
file copy G file open and so on it's the

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,720
same thing if you are if you have ever

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,089
looked at the gnome developer

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,540
documentation for file access it's just

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:36,940
the same API it's kind of an abstraction

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,580
however various implementations so under

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,130
like so been inside that API you have

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,410
this thing called GV FS which does the

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:48,910
actual implementation for this for like

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,770
talking to the server and so on so if

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,380
you want to open your google drive in

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:57,250
any gnome gtk whatever application you

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,050
just use a scheme url url like this

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,029
google dashdrive colon slash slash

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:07,270
that's the scheme and then you put in

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:09,880
your Google whatever at gmail com so

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,400
here's the thing this is what took six

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,230
years so the main problem is that Google

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,420
Drive is not POSIX paste which means

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,120
that like if you create a file on an

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,240
opposite each kind of thing on a file

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,490
system so you do touch / name / who sews

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,920
so / name / who becomes your like your

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,070
unique identifier for that file however

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,630
on google drive which is database based

00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,550
even if you can sort of see things like

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,390
a file system kind of thing even if you

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,810
can sort of browse it as a recursive

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,910
sorry as a hierarchical file system even

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,820
though the UI makes it look like that

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,410
internally they are all ids so when you

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,780
create a file you don't really create a

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,360
path you create a like a blob like an ID

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,709
so so every time you create a file the

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,200
application things that it created /

00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,790
name / who wears the the actual file

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,390
system or the database things it created

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,500
some blob ID so so there is some

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,900
disparity between what the application

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,329
things have and what the file system or

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,589
the database in this case things had

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,510
happened so there is this thing called

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,750
volatile path I can't really explain

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,670
what it or what it's all about so unless

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,840
you're of application developer

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,670
you don't really need to bother about it

00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,250
and you only need to bother about it if

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,740
you're creating files like not if you're

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,210
in a read-only kind of mode and if you

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,100
need to bother about it look up this

00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,930
thing on the gnome developer

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,090
documentation I think you can just put

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:37,140
it in google and type grown whatever

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,140
blob of light should show up that's it

00:17:49,410 --> 00:18:00,790
yeah yes we basically what we do is like

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,260
if you are using the g lib api's then we

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,020
kind of prohibit you from creating

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,270
another file with the same name however

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,130
if you already had one we kind of try to

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,700
deal with it but you cannot create

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,080
another one using this our API that's

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,970
the best we can do and there are some

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,380
gaps small gaps which need to be plugged

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,150
hopefully you'll never notice what we'll

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,470
get to plugging them because because

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,060
they are all due to this whole database

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,960
kind of thing they need greater changes

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,960
in the way things work

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:40,920
I think so I would expect the server to

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,120
take care of it it shouldn't it

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,620
shouldn't be very different from what

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,600
what happens when you type on the

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,600
browser right from the browser windows

00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,630
yeah I think so like Microsoft has 11

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:05,419
drive I think it also is similar and

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:10,770
Dropbox they're all kind of similar yeah

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:23,030
yeah they all have this blog yeah

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:23,030
exactly yeah so that's it okay thank you

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,429
so here's your scarf

00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:56,540
okay now we have Phil Sutter talking

00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:58,460
about better mobile email please do that

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,660
and do better in mobile email for me

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:07,490
I'll hug you there let's see what

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:13,520
happens ok I'm Phil I'm working for red

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:18,050
hat and I have no time still I want to

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,150
talk to you I have well while thinking

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:24,710
about something to present about i

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:26,750
clicked through powerful fields slides

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,530
about better mobile email from two years

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:33,890
ago and I thought well been there done

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:36,770
that mmm still doing that but I've

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:39,770
improved a little bit over his so I

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:44,690
thought yeah let's do bashing more or

00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:48,460
less no not really ok so why do we talk

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:52,100
about this I'm a notebook user obviously

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:56,000
so I'm sometimes offline still happens

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,360
and I want to be tolerant to that so I

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,450
don't want to lose my email and I want

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,350
to at least prevent like I'm sending

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,230
emails while while I'm offline and all

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:13,430
this while I'm doing all this I want to

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:17,630
have my mutt in fast as fast as it is

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:23,420
normal normally and another benefit of

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:28,130
my setup is that I basically do backup

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:31,810
the leanest hall style so I replicate my

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:38,540
mail year which is a bunch of gigabytes

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:42,410
meanwhile to several machines and if one

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:45,860
breaks or I'm s the setup on one I might

00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,750
still have the others as long as I'm

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,110
faster than the replicating process but

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:54,980
that's a different topic ok what foods

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:57,670
do I use obviously I use mud just like

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,670
poor field and

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,540
motivation behind this is exactly the

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:07,210
same it's it's quick but in my case I

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:10,960
didn't like it so much with smtp and

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:13,930
imap so yeah you always have to connect

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,530
somewhere and it does caching but it

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:20,650
doesn't do for caching and whatnot okay

00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:25,060
will address this another thing central

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:28,030
point in my setup is my own MX basically

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:31,600
I have an imap server running and this

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:34,870
will hold all my email in a central

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,190
point it will retrieve a new emails of

00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:41,200
course and i will use it for sending i

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,810
have prop nail set up there and fetch

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,730
mail and whatnot everything you don't

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:51,160
want on your mobile on your mobile

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:56,950
device for the synchronization i use em

00:23:51,160 --> 00:24:00,490
be suing in contrary to what poor is

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:03,310
used which was offline i met i used that

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,790
one stool or actually quite for a while

00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:12,370
but yeah it's python and python slow and

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:14,740
offline i may be slow in person so mb

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:22,300
swing is a lot better in my point of

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:28,300
view i use esmtp which is a very tiny

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:31,810
relay only MTA so i can only use this

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,580
for sending email and yeah I don't need

00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,150
to retrieve it because I do everything

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:43,090
via imap so I don't need to have full

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:47,970
post fix running on my potentially 10

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:50,470
year or device which I've in private and

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:55,150
yeah the only thing that I had to add

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:59,560
was queuing support which is there since

00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:01,810
then another thing another goodie to all

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,420
this is screen which I used to make

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,760
things a little bit more convenient or

00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,910
not a big thing

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:13,260
I'll quickly cover this okay how to set

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:16,890
this up first ambi swing which is the

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,660
biggest issue there because it's in its

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,510
configuration as cryptic as offline

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:25,050
enemies so you don't gain anything there

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:29,940
but at least it's but we are quite

00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:32,610
straightforward this is already quite

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:37,230
the whole configuration it consists of

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:40,640
two stored definitions a storage

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:45,230
basically anything that holds email so I

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:49,860
have one for media and another one for

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:52,650
14 mm and I have two channels one which

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:56,280
does well a channel says we're what you

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:59,910
soon from where and one is only for the

00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:03,090
inbox and the other is for all the

00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:09,030
subfolders I have in there and some

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:11,190
patterns because it's zimbra and I have

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:14,060
a shell script which runs mb song in

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:17,810
loops and that's why I have two channels

00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:21,290
the inbox assumed every 10 seconds and

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:25,800
the subfolders only every 100 seconds

00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:28,740
makes all the sense so it's I have quick

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:34,970
email and it doesn't always pull through

00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:38,280
everything next thing is esmtp set up

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:41,340
this is the first two lines are

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:47,520
basically just for local delivery so it

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:49,110
calls pop near then next is the my

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,500
default setup you know something i

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:55,590
forgot there's identity support so the

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,620
remaining part is basically for when i'm

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:02,000
sending email as a different user i'm

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:05,370
using in this case and ssh tunnel to

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,170
them to connect to a different med

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:13,950
server okay for queuing support i need a

00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:17,880
wrapper which does yeah the anchoring in

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:20,640
case no med service is reachable

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:25,200
and make you deliver you know the name

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,800
has a dollar in case initio delivery

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,220
failed I need a cron job to regularly

00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:36,570
retry the Afghan teaser is just a

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:39,510
simpler version I skip that ok finally

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:43,350
to hook this all together I have a

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:46,050
screener see which calls from well when

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:50,160
I call screen with that configuration it

00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:53,220
starts for me the mb singular and not in

00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,850
a second window at the same time and I

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:59,460
have bindings for instead of creating a

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,660
new window directly spawn a new mutt

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:07,470
because it's single threaded and yeah

00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:12,360
that's basically it you can read the

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:16,830
full story with lots of verbosity on my

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,860
own wiki page there are project pages

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:23,190
for esmtp and i'm icing which am be

00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:26,550
suing belongs to and these are the

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:31,620
important man pages or written is that

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:35,070
for ok i have a few minutes left three

00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:43,260
minutes that's cool one thing i could

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:48,390
show you is that screen setup does this

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:51,870
work yes it works so here's ambition

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:56,760
running and at least the loop and it

00:28:51,870 --> 00:29:02,220
couldn't connect i have not in the

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:07,110
second window and control a and C spawns

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:10,650
another mud and if I close it the

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:12,090
windows automatically closed and my

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,250
setup is actually a little bit more

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:19,590
complex I have it better described on my

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:21,630
Vicky page and if I close the the first

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:26,310
window or the second one in this case it

00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:27,960
will close the whole screen so yeah

00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,460
which adds a little bit more convenience

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:37,169
in my case

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:37,169
okay that's it um switch like questions

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,669
did anyone understand what I'm saying

00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:56,919
does anyone use email okay okay so you

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:59,789
can understand me max turned on well

00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,789
then thanks

00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,559
sorry for that it's possible to switch

00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:01,850
it off what I don't know how to do this

00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:14,500
I do everything I don't using total

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:18,020
transparency right total trash can yes

00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:21,440
the project lead for the open shift

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:24,770
Commons and for open shift community so

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,330
I do community management and i'm going

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:29,090
to ask how many of you you're all are

00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:32,500
you all red hatters is there anyone not

00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:39,860
a red hat ER what company are you with

00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:41,480
the freelancing cool alright so there's

00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,059
a couple of you so what we're trying to

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,980
do with open shift mostly when you're a

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:48,320
community manager what you're doing is

00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,289
begging people to work on your project

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,090
okay so we're trying me it's the truth

00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,549
isn't it alright work we're called cat

00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:58,880
herders and people who try and you know

00:32:55,549 --> 00:33:01,760
bribe you with beer or swag or t-shirts

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,799
or you know free hosting tears or

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,530
whatever we've tried everything I'd open

00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:09,679
shift okay trust me I've been doing this

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,480
for many years on lots of different open

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,780
source and open standard projects and

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:19,520
it's the same all the time an open shift

00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:20,929
is a unique project in that it is what

00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,830
is doing is bringing a platform as a

00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:27,470
service to your theater and it has many

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,570
components to it besides the code base

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,580
that we work on ourselves so there are a

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,860
lot of things we integrate and pull

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:38,240
along with us that we upstream and with

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:40,400
the new openshift origin three we are

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,320
pulling in Coober Nettie's so sometimes

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,480
when I described open shift these days I

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,210
say it's a very value-added Kubra

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,330
Nettie's distribution and we're pulling

00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,340
in docker we're using ansible we drop

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,960
puppet will might bring some puppet

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,990
scripts back in some day but there's a

00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,770
lot of other communities that we touch

00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:02,180
and if you go to github I'm going to ask

00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,920
you to do this okay Adam you're up there

00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:09,500
you haven't done this before go to this

00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:12,950
github repo and like us okay I'm trying

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:17,810
to get that by the end of dev comp to be

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:20,090
a thousand i will like you back star me

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,850
all right this this is the reason i said

00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,520
i would do a lightning talk you i will

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:28,130
use your email tricks go to github by

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,550
the end of this conference we are going

00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:34,520
to hit a thousand because i'm i'm trying

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,730
to beat the KU burnetii stars alright

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,530
i'm also on the community management

00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:43,310
calls for the cuban at ease with a good

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:47,350
friend of mine Sarah Novotny so this is

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:49,880
my real call to action here because

00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:52,820
there's lots of activity in open shift

00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:56,000
we've got tons of people contributing

00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:59,000
code lots of companies there are 35

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,530
different companies besides red hat that

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,450
have contributed since the beginning of

00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:08,090
the project to open shift tons of code

00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,220
contribution going on but that's really

00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,110
not enough to sustain a project is just

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,730
a bunch of people working on the project

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,470
together which is a good thing and I did

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,900
go to the office and there was this huge

00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:20,420
sign and it was basically my mantra

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,840
because I truly believe that there is a

00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:27,200
new model for community development and

00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,060
we are calling it a Commons so okay most

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,030
of you know that red hat is close to

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,470
Boston and Boston in the middle of the

00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,240
city there's this thing called the

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,610
commons and back in the colonial times

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,350
that's where everybody had shared

00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:42,650
resources that's whether you bring your

00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:44,330
cows to graze on the grass you set up

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,690
farmers markets now if you're hipsters

00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,640
in San Francisco and so this Commons

00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:53,000
model is is slightly different because

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,030
when v3 came out for open shift we did a

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,790
complete architectural 360 we dropped

00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:01,700
Ruby thank God and we switched to

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,800
rewriting it and go I my code name on

00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:08,000
twitter is Python DJ so I give away

00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:11,120
where I really like to code and we had

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,860
this huge job we had a 2.5 million

00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,260
applications running that's a lot of

00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,560
developers running an open shift

00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,270
online who are all happy we had over a

00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,760
hundred and fifty deployments that we

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,890
knew about those were enterprise folks

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,870
who had deployed openshift and we had to

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,750
get them all to migrate to this new

00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,610
architecture and there are five

00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:33,190
evangelists and two product managers and

00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:35,410
we were on calls all the time so it

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,660
didn't really scale so what we decided

00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:40,000
to do was change the model so it would

00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,010
be more peer-to-peer it's kind of like

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,480
stepping back and getting red hat out of

00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:47,650
the way so what we did we started

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,560
Commons briefings almost on a weekly

00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:55,780
cadence depending on my travel schedule

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,280
I host Commons they do demonstrations of

00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,530
different functionality identity

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,260
management's coming up soon we just did

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,570
lat yes yesterday I did one on deploying

00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,450
openshift on OpenStack with Marla

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:11,080
Maureen and we do deep dives into the

00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,120
projects and then we have a great Q&A in

00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,070
conversation and what was wonderful

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,380
about yesterday's thing is that for

00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,350
people who I didn't even know head open

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,590
sac deployments were on the call in the

00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:25,450
Q&A session asking questions because in

00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,820
the past people just deployed open shift

00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,560
and it didn't use native OpenStack

00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,420
resources and mark was talking about a

00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,700
reference architecture to start using

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,950
things like cinder and making it work

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,560
with the resources better and more

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,850
integrated so it was really cool we're

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,570
starting up a whole bunch of cigs

00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:46,000
there's one for edu and gov now there's

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:49,330
an operator sig we're starting at telcos

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,640
sake and we'll probably do one on

00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:55,150
OpenStack shortly and I just got asked

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,310
to start an open shift on centos one so

00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,160
there's lots of that and we have lots of

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:02,170
events so there's lots of people a lot

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,590
of them are origin deployments i went to

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:08,070
the OpenStack Tokyo conference and it's

00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,270
almost like coming out of the closet oh

00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,730
there was I would I gave a presentation

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:15,850
and at the same time semantics gave a

00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,200
presentation on on platform as a service

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,600
and I I was a little worried because

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,550
they had listed in there abstract all

00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,960
the different platforms of services

00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,970
Cloud Foundry open Diaz

00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,859
grano all these other ways of doing

00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,300
application deployments and I was kind

00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:30,680
of like oh I should really be in their

00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,770
session to make sure they don't trash

00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,170
openshift and what they did instead was

00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,750
they completely added themselves a huge

00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,760
fan boys of open shift and trashed the

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,440
other three folks and talked about

00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,690
different things about our new

00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,310
architecture and people came up to me

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,020
after which is where were you you should

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:52,250
have heard this so luckily it was

00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:55,130
recorded lots of upstream process we now

00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,960
have that we had 35 folks who different

00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:00,140
companies that have contributed we have

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,859
over 175 organizations that are public

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,480
publicly referenced referenceable

00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:06,680
companies that are now part of open

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,560
shift Commons so if you go to the

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:13,339
commons at openshift org page you will

00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,720
see a huge list of logos and different

00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:17,240
projects every but there's a lot of the

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,240
open source projects centos fedora

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,470
things like that but the majority of

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,300
them are either people who have

00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,820
integrated things into openshift

00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,550
upstream projects that we upstream or

00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,830
people who most of them are folks who

00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:33,470
are operating platforms as a service

00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:36,530
that use open shift or enterprise

00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:39,470
deployments so there are on the mailing

00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:41,630
lists over 550 people talking to each

00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:44,839
other there are a lot of people if

00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,280
you're from Red Hat join it I do a lot

00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:48,020
of work with the essays and the

00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,890
consulting services they reuse the

00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:53,960
briefing content just this week infosys

00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,510
3 scale and we've works joined and

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,780
they're giving introductory briefings

00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:03,440
shortly on their services infosys was

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,970
has a huge open shift POC going on right

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,330
now so we're really thrilled to have

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:11,570
them on about about 33 folks a week join

00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:16,099
so it's a really growing growing

00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:17,900
ecosystem lots of people in there what

00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,940
we're doing with our different upstream

00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,460
communities get up cloud is the platform

00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,740
as a service that's down in Brazil

00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:27,230
they've been running on AWS using s3

00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,599
storage they are porting their

00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,830
production platform as a service public

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,910
offering you can use your credit card

00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,359
and swipe they've got all the

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:37,029
integration done to Azure in early June

00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,099
so they're doing some great work

00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:41,709
we're working with the azure folks to

00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:45,789
get dotnet containers working and be

00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:47,169
first-class citizens on openshift coober

00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:49,269
Nettie's i think i said already that

00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:50,739
we're going to rheank in my humble

00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:54,119
opinion to wear their best enterprise

00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:58,239
route to the SAR rags either so thanks

00:41:55,479 --> 00:42:04,140
email servers stop Cody get all your

00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:04,140
friends to like us

00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:14,580
oh ok so we're not going to catch up I

00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,580
can't do it I'd like to be over I think

00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:49,170
I have loved you from everything I see

00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:11,509
I had this different definition of

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:19,279
mobile I thought you mean this email on

00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:23,329
this is crap we're all still interesting

00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:37,969
I'm not that power not such a male power

00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:42,279
user evolution and that's it yeah and I

00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:45,349
actually think it's about a good thing

00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:48,289
well nobody bothers me so I can focus on

00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:55,099
doing some other work yeah I started

00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:58,059
doing I started having this encrypted

00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:01,190
email I sent myself in investment okay

00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:06,469
slide okay that's not reachable I'm

00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:08,709
schedule and so started watching the

00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:08,709
factor

00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:22,490
even like the amount of email I get

00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:27,340
within redhat is so huge that I

00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:27,340
basically decided I only in the morning

00:44:33,730 --> 00:45:23,020
otherwise I used it once was anybody

00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,020
before

00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:36,530
see what browser what folders have new

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:40,550
files afternoon miles in it and we can

00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:43,220
directly jump from one to the other the

00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:49,390
other was there was some some hidden

00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:52,310
feature in in this and this will cool it

00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:56,420
actually because ambition creates new

00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:59,080
mayor years when it swings and so I have

00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:02,150
a small script which checks through

00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:06,160
which goes through all the subfolders on

00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:10,580
and creates a mud compatible mailboxes

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,830
by which I can then sauce and which

00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:15,620
means i have so many mailboxes to find

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:20,780
that my sidebar would ever throw anyway

00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:23,540
and also since i normally use this for

00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,630
windows setup on national screens I

00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:29,390
don't want to waste any any screen real

00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:31,730
estate and as you have seen probably

00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:35,570
their spare space for the email address

00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:41,330
in the subject it's mostly right half of

00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:44,020
the subject before i delete the human so

00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,020
