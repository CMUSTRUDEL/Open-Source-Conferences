Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Jeremy Eder

In this session, Red Hatâ€™s Service Delivery Architects will walk through how cloud.redhat.com can be used to deploy a managed OpenShift 4.x cluster across multiple clouds. We will show how our SRE team manages these clusters at scale, and how cluster telemetry is used to drive engineering and feature priorities. Finally, we will show a worked example of how we evolved an existing application to onboard onto OSD.
