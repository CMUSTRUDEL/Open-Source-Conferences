User onboarding is guiding users to use your product and find value in it. Users understand how to use your product to meet their goals. You may have the best product, but if the users cannot figure out how to get started, they will never use your product. This is where User Onboarding helps!

◦ External:

▪ Product release emails
▪ Help topics
• Examples of companies that use good onboarding to guide their users
• Examples of onboarding tools to get started
• Retiring an onboarding artifact
The session will help the audience to think about onboarding strategies and which artifacts to include in their products!
