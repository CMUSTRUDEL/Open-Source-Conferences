Description: 
	Speaker: Parth Dhanjal

I'll be focusing on how Lago can be used to spin up infrastructures on very minimal resources(just your laptop is enough) and perform end-to-end testings.
I'll start with a small introduction to testing frameworks and continue to how lago works and how you can define your environment needed for testing.
A brief explanation about ovirt-system-tests, what different test_suites are currently included, how to run an ovirt-system-test instance and then interact with the environment once it is up and running.
Closing with a small preview about how ovirt-system-tests are used for CI automation.
