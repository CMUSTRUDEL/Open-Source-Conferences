In 2001, the Agile Manifesto, a collection of simple principles for software development, was published. It helped shape how development teams work. Meanwhile, open source has its own set of principles that promote and build community, transparency, and collaboration, and meritocracy. On paper these two sets of principles match closely. But in practice, using Agile in an open source project may make community members wary, especially volunteers.

This is extra challenging for CentOS and Fedora, since Red Hat sponsors those projects and contributes in order to meet business goals. The Community Platform Engineering team has a foot in both the business and open source camps to support both CentOS and Fedora. How can we better interact with global volunteers and Red Hat, increase confidence in delivering on important goals, and do it openly and transparently? How do we embrace and not isolate? How do we ensure that we add value? How do we actually function? Join my session to find out!
