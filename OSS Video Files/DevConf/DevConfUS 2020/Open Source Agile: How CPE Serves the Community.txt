Title: Open Source Agile: How CPE Serves the Community
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Leigh Griffin

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto, a collection of simple principles for software development, was published. It helped shape how development teams work. Meanwhile, open source has its own set of principles that promote and build community, transparency, and collaboration, and meritocracy. On paper these two sets of principles match closely. But in practice, using Agile in an open source project may make community members wary, especially volunteers.

This is extra challenging for CentOS and Fedora, since Red Hat sponsors those projects and contributes in order to meet business goals. The Community Platform Engineering team has a foot in both the business and open source camps to support both CentOS and Fedora. How can we better interact with global volunteers and Red Hat, increase confidence in delivering on important goals, and do it openly and transparently? How do we embrace and not isolate? How do we ensure that we add value? How do we actually function? Join my session to find out!

all right um thank you

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
everybody for coming to this session

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,160
today um really great to see some

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
familiar names and faces

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,679
and some folks that i don't know as well

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,120
so i'll do a quick

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,960
introduction to myself and then the

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,960
topic and we'll get into it so

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,400
my name is lee griffin i am an

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,560
engineering manager

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
and for what we know as the cpe team

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,519
which is the community platform

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,720
engineering team we'll hear a little bit

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,680
more about the team in a couple of

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,359
minutes

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
but they work exclusively in the

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,760
community and they're an

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,520
open source facing team and that's where

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,960
this idea came to me to

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,079
do a talk on how our team tries to serve

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
the community

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,680
i'm not saying we're perfect and not

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,320
saying we're there and we're definitely

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,000
on the journey and i see sarah finn um

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,680
in the virtual audience there so sarah

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,079
is our agile practitioner so a lot of

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,199
this

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,960
um goodwill and ideas and

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,559
implementation details are down to her

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
energy her drive and our passion so

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,520
thank you very much sarah

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,680
and from the team as well as in the

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,559
communities

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,760
so i'm going to kick into it um and just

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,799
give a little bit of background about

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,760
the team

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,439
so the cpe team and we have two

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,360
communities that we serve we serve the

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,200
fedora community and the center west

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
community and we've got this fantastic

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
logo

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
that was created by mo duffy and one of

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,960
the fedora community members for us

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
which um if you're into symbolism and

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
into design

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
you can see elements of the logos from

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,799
both fedora and centos in there and a

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,560
bridge

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
and from a unification perspective so

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
it's a very cool logo that we have

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,680
but the team has a very broad remit um

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,640
we deal with the system administration

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
uh of the infrastructure that is used to

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,119
effectively build

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,119
um and release the fedora and the center

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,640
west operating systems but we're much

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,520
more than just an operating systems

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,240
house

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
and we manage the pipelines which we

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
know is release engineering to help

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
packages flow

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,920
into the system for release time and we

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,759
manage a huge suite of services over a

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,240
hundred at last count

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,040
which enables our community and enables

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
the success

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
of their applications and their

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
interactions within both fedora and

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,479
center west

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
on top of that we don't just maintain

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,720
things we try our best to add value

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
as a good agile team adding value is

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,080
exactly what you want to do

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,959
so we proactively engage with the

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,040
communities and we build out initiatives

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
and their new service offerings or

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,760
enhancements on existing offerings that

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
are out there

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
that will hopefully make people's lives

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,360
easier and bring some form of value to

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,360
the wider ecosystems that we work in

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,440
i want to talk briefly about the open

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,599
source um intersection

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,120
so this is actually becoming a norm

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,360
across the industry and you're attending

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
an

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
open source dominated conference so i

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,160
don't need to go into too much detail

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,720
about why

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
open source but more and more enterprise

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,959
teams are slowly coming to the

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
realization

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,599
that there is communities out there that

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
are working with technologies that are

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,360
part of their stack

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
there's also very robust technology

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
stacks out there which means the

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,040
enterprise doesn't have to develop

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,879
every single piece of the pie and they

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,200
can take various slices in various

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,800
communities and focus on their value add

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
and their unique selling

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,239
and point from that now this should be a

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,879
symbiotic relationship so the community

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
should get

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,040
as much value as the enterprise driven

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,640
teams from this that's not always the

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
case and that's just

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,599
um how some of these communities plan

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,239
out but the benefits can be huge and

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,080
i've pulled a really great article on a

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,159
shameless plug for opensource.com

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,000
here and there's some fantastic blogs

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,000
and content on it and this talks about

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
the enterprise open source advantages

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,239
but

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,599
i've kind of enhanced some of the

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,040
keywords which i feel

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,519
resonate with me from an azure

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,840
perspective faster time to market

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,480
crowdsourcing transparency

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,319
merit-based they're all things that most

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,840
agile teams strive for

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,080
and here you got a community doing this

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,159
day in day out so there's a very natural

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,560
intersection point for me

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,159
and speaking from an agile perspective

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
and now more teams are starting to

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
discover this and the whole point of

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,799
this um

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
talk i suppose is to show you some of

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
the changes that you might have to make

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,959
to your flavor of agile

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,640
and to leverage these opportunities and

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,000
to enhance the offering that you'll

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
ultimately deliver to your customers

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,759
what really struck me a couple of years

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
ago was the value alignment and anybody

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,199
who'd seen me present before would have

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,479
seen the slide several times so

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,280
apologies for the reuse um

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,759
red hat has a very strong values-driven

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,919
um

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,280
approach most teams do it seems to be

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,520
the norm of the industry and it helps

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,440
define your culture really

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,040
and if you take agile and i'm focusing

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,560
on scrum here because it is one of the

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
most prevalent from a software

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,919
engineering perspective

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
and they have value statements out there

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
for us

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,520
and if you take opensource.com values

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
and which kind of manifest themselves as

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
the wider

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,160
open source values you'd see steel

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,680
threads running through them

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,600
you'll see they talk about freedom

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
openness and open exchange across all

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,560
three

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,320
commitment appears word for word and two

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
of them red hat is actually founded on a

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,960
meritocracy

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,759
and that's pretty much what open source

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,360
is about and what you have there

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,880
is what we call a frictionless

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
environment

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,039
as a team you don't want your team's

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,000
processes and your team's values to be

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,160
at odds

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,360
with anything else be it other teams be

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
it the company

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,800
and or be it the tooling in the

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,280
communities that you're using when you

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,680
have this steel tread running true

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
that gives a really unique experience

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,479
because everybody appreciates

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,720
why we're trying to work this way and it

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,400
level sets the values across the board

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
so people effectively speak the same

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,000
language

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,000
and this was eye-opening for me and when

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
i had the opportunity in red hat to move

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
internally to

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
an open source-centric team this is

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
primarily what attracted me to it

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
attracted me at values

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,319
um point of view now

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
agile is all about teamwork uh i often

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,160
call it the continuous integration kind

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
of tool chain and at a software

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,039
perspective

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,039
but at an actual agile perspective we

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,800
continuously want to be improving we

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,360
want to continuously plan

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,639
innovate integrate deliver and get

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
better as a team

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,280
now all of this mindset is really what

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
good engineers and teams strive for this

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,120
isn't anything unique about

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
agile but open source doesn't change

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,240
that and that can scare

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
some teams that are going to try and

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,759
open their processes and try and do more

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,520
things in the open

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,039
i can't do my planning how would always

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,120
do it i can't innovate

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,720
um as freely because customer secrets

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
will get out there

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
a lot of people familiar with scrum will

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
often hear this is scrum bush

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,479
this is almost agile but we're agile but

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,759
we can't do all the things we normally

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,960
do because we're now working in the

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,680
community

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,199
to me it magnifies it because you have a

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
ready and willing

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,160
and exceptionally passionate user base

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
that want to innovate that want to work

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,919
with your tools and your teams that want

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
to benefit from your delivery

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,440
and equally want to improve at an

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,960
individual level as well as at the

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,000
collective project level

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,120
and which is fantastic so there's no

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,039
issue um from your day-to-day

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,479
teamwork values and what you put time

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,240
and energy into

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,880
when you transition into an open source

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,880
facing team

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,080
so one of the first things that we have

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
to do as a team when we really started

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,639
to gather

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,560
together and put a patent plan forward

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
and for us we needed to define our scope

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
and our mission

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
now this is particularly true at a team

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
level but in communities they're

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,280
absolutely huge

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,560
people associate fedora with just the

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,479
operating systems

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
and in paraphrasing matthew miller here

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,080
the fedora project lead

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,919
when he talks about fedora he talks

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
about as a collection of people and

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,039
services

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
all coming together with open source at

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,919
heart

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,599
and that means the community can be huge

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,639
and your interaction point might be a

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,879
very narrow sliver within that community

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,560
so by you defining your mission and

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,960
sticking to it

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,440
that helps the community have clarity

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,759
about what your rule is

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
we regularly get requests for items

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,680
outside of our scope we absolutely

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,680
consider him we absolutely engage

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,520
but we know there's no ownership on us

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,560
to go ahead and work with that

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,800
idea or try and fix that issue and from

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,639
a team perspective that creates a very

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
safe environment and i'm not going to

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,560
talk about psychological safety after

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,120
the last call which is fantastic by the

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,000
way but that clarity for the team

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,919
it helps them in a very public manner

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,760
and i'll talk a little bit about some of

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,080
maybe the more negative aspects that the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
teams experience in open source

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,919
but having this defined scope and

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,800
mission it provides huge clarification

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,120
for everyone

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,159
and that was really the beginning of our

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,240
journey and we

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
shared that journey through blog posts

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
with the communities

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
so everyone understood who we were what

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,120
we were and what our identity was

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,680
which was hugely important

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,360
now you need to work together in any

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,519
relationship so this can be

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,279
any stakeholders let alone community

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,080
facing stakeholders

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,080
now the difficulty with a community is

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
it is a collection of individuals

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
who all have very strong opinions and

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
like anybody with very strong opinions

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,200
we rarely agree

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
but what you'll find in communities is

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,920
their structure set up to enable the

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,399
communities to grow and detroit

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
fedora and said the west have governing

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,360
bodies

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
uh in fedora the council and sent to us

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,399
as a board and they have different

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
meanings and different mechanics behind

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
them but effectively they become the

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,760
voice for the overall

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,200
project at a steering committee kind of

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,440
level you

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,000
communicated practices and this is

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,320
really where your team needs to identify

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,959
who their stakeholders are because you

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
cannot identify every single individual

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,800
user in the community

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
as a stakeholder with an equal voice you

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
want to try and group them you want to

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
try and get a singular voice coming true

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,320
to avoid the noise and avoid the

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,279
confusion and of course you want to

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,160
evolve them

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,600
you don't want them on the periphery and

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,880
you want to try and get them involved as

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
many of your activities

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,519
include them on the right communications

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,440
and make them feel part of your

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,200
agile framework now your stakeholders

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,360
generally should be expressing to your

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
team their needs in the form of what you

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,560
want and what you wanted so really value

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,839
proposition

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,640
for investing your team's um finite

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,200
resources

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,040
into a project and what's really great

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,880
about open source communities

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,880
they rarely come with the business

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,680
pressure of a paying customer saying

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,200
and i need this by this day so the when

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,640
aspect is rare

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,160
sometimes it happens if they want to try

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,079
and leverage an opportunity and of

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,320
course you're willing to work with that

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
but given the team that freedom that

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
they don't feel under pressure to

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
deliver

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,839
immediately are on a very tight time

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,760
scale

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
actually allows them enhance their agile

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
processes and allows them

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,720
worry about delivering when it's ready

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,320
rather than

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
when the date was set for them in the

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,640
sound

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,880
now open source is a very communication

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,839
heavy um experience prepare for a lot of

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
emails

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,640
multiple email lists and are the norm

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,800
in open source communities for

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,560
development for infrastructure

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,399
for all of those things and subgroups

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,160
that i mentioned earlier

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,720
you need to be on them you need to be

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,959
listening but set up good filters

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,640
and watch for your keywords and watch

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
for your interactions you will learn a

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,839
lot passively from just

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
observing and you'll gain a lot of

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,880
valuable feedback about your team

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,560
your product your interactions and the

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,800
perception of you and the team

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,040
and a little tip get in line abide by

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
their style and so emails

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,440
in open source go with the inline style

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,240
which when you get used to it becomes

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
fantastic

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,120
and then you try to mail people who

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,120
don't get it it becomes very confusing

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,839
um irc is predominantly um the approach

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,240
to instant messaging communication

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,760
within communities now discord and other

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
applications are starting to gain

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
traction

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,880
but irc provides records of the chat

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
that people can refer to

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,560
and all of this emails and all of this

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
irc is set up for asynchronous

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
communication

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
because people who are involved in open

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,560
source communities they have day jobs

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,639
their parents and they have outside

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
lives and they can't commit to being on

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,279
a keyboard responding within a couple of

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,720
minutes which is why irc and emails are

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,040
de facto means to communicate

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
issue trackers are something that the

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,480
community use when they're trying to fix

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,839
bugs or raise issues

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
or get a resolution to an ongoing task

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,120
and this is something that your team

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,040
has to start focusing on and worry about

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,040
manual thinking later because i do

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,639
understand the power of jira i am an

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,279
absolute fan of jira

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,279
and some of the other tools but the

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,880
community aren't and i'll explain why in

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,560
a moment why they're not such a fan of

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720
tools like that

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,839
and we also try to use the open decision

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
framework so

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,320
the open decision framework is a great

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,399
way to scope your communications

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,240
and help involve the community and why a

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,279
decision has been made

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
this is really really important and we

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,320
tried it

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,160
and we done our best with the open

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
decision framework and we made mistakes

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
and we learned from it and that's a

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,800
great agile

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,320
journey and to mess things up and move

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,360
yourself forward and try and learn from

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
it again

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
but the community respected um the

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,519
intent

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,200
of using the decision framework perhaps

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,200
the execution didn't match it

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,360
but if you become an open team and you

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
want that level of feedback and honesty

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,760
the odf is something you should

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
definitely consider

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,480
realigning your tooling so every

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,560
good agile team and every strong manager

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
or programmer project manager or the

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,920
other um

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
hierarchical roles that want to get a

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
pulse on where your project are

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
they have a set of tools they want to

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,199
use um

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,800
internally in red hat we have jira we

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,000
have google docs we have google me so

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,440
they're all fantastic

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,800
ways to communicate track projects and

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,320
asynchronously

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,160
share information across the

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,839
organization

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
a lot of those are closed door tools

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,079
though they're behind vpns they're

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,320
unable to be accessed by the community

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,079
so one thing we had to look at was

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
ditching a lot of those tills

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,160
where we could and where it made sense

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
and i'm not saying throw everything out

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,360
there's times when you do want to work

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,120
on google docs there's times when you do

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,760
need to have a quick google meet

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,600
and or blue jeans or whatever other

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,000
voice comments you're using

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
so we looked at taking a public tiger

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,240
instance which is an

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,399
open source version of an issue tracker

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320
we use hackmd for sharing

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,519
notes and collaboratively with the

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,839
community

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,199
some of our teams use jitsi which is a

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,040
free open source

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,560
um web conference software

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,240
and you might have noticed a thread and

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,760
a commonality there they're all open

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,399
source tools

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,440
the community in open source um in the

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
open source world

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,000
really respect and love the fact that we

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,079
try to use open source where we can

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,279
uh this is ubiquitous across most open

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,120
source communities

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,519
and they will respect that you are

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,320
trying to engage with the philosophy

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,639
the mindset and the approach by

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
compromising on the functionality

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,959
tiger versus jira there's no comparison

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
in terms of what jira gives you as an

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,720
enterprise grade tool

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,800
that comes with a massive cost as anyone

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
who's um had to pay a bill for jira but

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,320
no

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,759
you take the hit on the functionality

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,839
but does that matter

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,519
that's entirely up to your team and i'll

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,320
leave you mull on that with

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,240
the quote from the um agile manifesto

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,440
about individuals and interactions over

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
processes and tools

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,839
so we try and open our communication

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
lines to the community and we do run our

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,079
team meetings through irc we run backlog

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,839
refinements bug discussions some teams

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,360
do daily standoffs asynchronously

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,279
through irc

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,199
and that means the community can dip in

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,959
and dip out and like i mentioned earlier

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,959
with time zones and with people having

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,279
personal lives and professional lives

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,120
and then the intersection there is the

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,040
the open source world

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,399
and they can dip in and read a meeting

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,399
that happened eight hours ago or eight

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,079
days ago and still in the same context

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,759
and still be able to respond and engage

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,759
with our team

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,880
we do a weekly email roundup to the

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,560
community

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
we showed them what we worked on we

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,240
invite comments we try and get a sense

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,040
of progression as the work is going

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,199
through

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,800
and hopefully we get some kind of

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,040
responses on us

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,720
what's really interesting here is we ran

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,959
a survey recently

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
and people said that the emails were one

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,560
of the most valuable mechanisms we had

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,720
to communicate

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,399
yet week on week we might get zero

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,839
comments or one comment on it

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
and you start to doubt is this the right

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,560
way to communicate but that's a lesson

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,440
learned

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,440
in the volume of emails that come into

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,720
an open source mailing list

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,800
not every mail is going to get a

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
response but people do read them they do

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,000
process them and they

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,000
absolutely do appreciate them coming in

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,160
you need to allow the community discover

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,919
you and your team

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,400
um the information that you share

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
is hugely important because you want to

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
route in you want the community to be

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,679
able to communicate with you find you

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,000
discover you work with your projects and

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,120
track

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,480
you so wiki pages usually popular for

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,120
communities

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,720
they might seem a bit antiquated for

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,160
enterprise grade teams

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
and but usually important for the

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
community it's the first place i go to

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,280
when i'm looking for

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,000
new information and before pinging

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,160
people on irc

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,160
twitter has emerged as a huge

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,120
communication vehicle for open source

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,039
communities

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,120
so get social go to where your community

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,039
interacts um

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,720
i follow a lot of the community

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
contributors they follow me

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,559
and it is great to see their insight

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,720
great to see what they're thinking about

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,080
great to see their perception of our

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,400
team

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,919
and the last point here is something

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,880
we're only starting to think about

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,039
recently it's humanizing the team

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
it's very easy for open source

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,559
communities to

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
criticize the corporate culture the

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,320
corporate team

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,640
very difficult to criticize people as

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,160
individuals everybody in our team is

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,880
trying their absolute level best

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
nobody gets up goes to work or work from

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,520
home as we're all doing now

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,559
to try and cause harm or

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,000
annoyance to anybody in the community

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,760
sure we're doing things and building

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
things people don't agree with or they

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,720
try and do it differently but like i

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,039
said earlier opinions

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,799
are out there everybody has one and we

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
need to be able to communicate and deal

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
with them and work

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,360
through those opinions but we're now

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,559
starting to try and humanize our team

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,400
then we're going to try a couple of

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,559
experiments in the coming weeks

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,240
to record small segments to some of our

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
meetings and make them available

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
so people see us they know the person

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,320
and the face and the voice

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,320
behind um the email moniker that goes

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,679
out there

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,360
now i didn't mention the mailing this

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,880
multiple times and it's showing the

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,799
importance of them

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,960
but you can't just be in read-only mode

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,919
get involved even if it's encouragement

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,799
even if it's a plus one on an idea and

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
if you can

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,480
default to open where the topic is not

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,640
sensitive if you're talking about

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,919
an architectural decision or how to

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
resolve a bug

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,880
why would you do that behind closed

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,640
doors why would you do that on one of

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,640
your internal mailing lists

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,320
when you could open it and possibly

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,080
involve the community who might come up

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
with an idea who might have an opinion

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
on it

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,640
and even if they don't you've made the

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,039
effort you've opened that transparency

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,880
aspect to them

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,640
now this is one of the slightly negative

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,679
sides of it you're going to get negative

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,600
comments

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,280
this is life you're going to get

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,960
somebody that doesn't agree with what

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,160
you're doing and they won't be

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,080
long without telling you about it and

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,600
it's generally not at a personal level

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
which is why i mentioned a humanizing

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,559
aspect

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,480
and a few minutes ago but you're never

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,480
going to satisfy everybody and in one

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,039
sense you have to grow a thick skin

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,360
but in another sense you want to engage

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,360
not at a tit-for-tat kind of

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,799
verbal sparring with someone but you

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,000
want to try and get to the root cause of

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,919
what the negativity is

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
you want to help understand where

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
they're coming from

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,480
and that could be a kind of coaching

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
exercise for people involved in that

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,840
capacity

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
and you can jump on irc sometimes the

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,640
written word

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
is awful for trying to interpret

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,919
people's real intent

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
and we've had some community members

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
jump on a call with us when we had some

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,880
tricky conversations

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,320
and within five minutes we clarified the

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,320
intent

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,600
that's just one of the more negative

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,520
aspects but

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,440
this happens in every team and

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
unfortunately you're going to encounter

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
it

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,919
and just knowing that will arm you with

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,159
the right tools

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,559
now i'm not expecting people to to read

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
the initiative flow that we have there

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,159
but you'll see it's a flow you'll see

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
it's a flow-based diagram there's

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,039
decision points there's entry points on

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
it

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,600
and what we want to really focus on here

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,480
is allowing the community

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
to have an input to your backlog to be

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,360
able to suggest an initiative for

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
consideration

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,720
community members have fallen to really

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,799
two camps there's the camps that want to

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,400
get items fixed your typical bugs your

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
problems your annoyances and they're

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,720
very easy to deal with because

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,080
they're often just in time and there's

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
something that the team consume

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,480
naturally as part of their work

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
but an initiative in our world is a

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,360
commitment

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,640
um in about a three month window we do

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,280
quarterly planning

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,960
and we try and work six weeks ahead of

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
ourselves so we know what we're going to

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,400
plan

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,240
roughly for q1 next year with no doubt

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
in kind of late october early november

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,000
kind of time

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,760
that gives the community a chance to see

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,600
the capacity of our team

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
to see what we have coming forward to

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,400
look at our roadmap to look at existing

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,240
initiatives

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,159
and more importantly it gives them a

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
clear route into us

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,760
and we involve the community as much as

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
we can and that

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,120
we haven't got a huge volume coming from

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
the community but we get

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,240
massive feedback on in-flight

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,240
initiatives that we're running

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,919
and we're hoping over the next year that

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,320
we get more community involvement and

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,640
ideas for consideration going to us

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,159
and again it's the intent you're opening

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
your doors and you're welcoming this

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
level of involvement

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,559
we do need to check the temperature

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,039
regularly and

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
we've ran two surveys and it's something

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,400
we're going to try and do maybe once

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,799
every two to three months

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
we go on mail threads we go on irc we

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,520
attend conferences that the community

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,480
attend

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,480
and this is all designed to almost run a

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,880
retrospective in the open

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
without calling it a retrospective we

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,000
want to get that feedback in that

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,679
perception because otherwise we're

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,559
living in a vacuum and pattern ourselves

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,240
on the back

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,240
we want to make sure that we're doing

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,159
our level best for the community

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,440
and not doing something that is causing

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,520
more harm than good

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,200
and by doing this frequently we have the

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,440
chance to course correct

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
our most recent survey we've pulled at

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,200
least 10 data points from it

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,280
which are now being worked through our

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,760
own internal backlog for improvements

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,679
that we're going to make going forward

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,440
and this is what a good agile team does

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,880
and that should not change from a

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,320
stakeholder perspective

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,919
it just changes from the volume of

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
stakeholders and individuals we want to

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,960
deal with because these surveys

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,679
are aimed at the individual contributor

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
level

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,799
we definitely do it with stakeholders we

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,039
do that more

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
in-depth in a more formal retrospective

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,679
but this is a chance for every voice to

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,240
matter

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,600
and if we're annoying one or two people

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,799
it can become a trend

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,080
and that's something we want to try and

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
nip in the boat as soon as we can

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,159
now i mentioned earlier about the

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,840
mutually beneficial um

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,600
approaches so the community should get

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,799
some value from

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,360
an enterprise grade team that has

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,159
x number of developers working a 40 hour

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,600
week

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,440
which is hopefully going to transition

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,520
to some value for the community

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,840
and here's some of the value that we've

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,000
um observed and that we've had commented

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,760
back to us from the communities

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
they receive much more focused

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,120
deliverables so

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,760
they're going to see the benefit of

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,320
putting five or six engineers

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
on a piece of tightly bound work that

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,400
will deliver that

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,640
promised value at the end of it the

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,039
previous model that we had in our team

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,600
was

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,400
individuals working on a lot of siloed

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,480
projects

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,400
which was fantastic we almost became

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,200
omnipresent by the fact we were moving

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
20 30 40 things at once

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,320
and that's just one or two individuals

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,720
in that example

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,279
and but this focus means we can get more

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,919
complex features out we can get more

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,360
resilient and deliverables which

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,400
ultimately is a quality

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,480
output that is going to be appreciated

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,120
by the community

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,840
now communities in general have their

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,679
own vision

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,880
they have their own focus and their own

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,919
goal

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,919
and as an agile team we're all about

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,120
visions and we understand the importance

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,279
of that

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,600
but by having this dedicated team and

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,200
having proposals come in

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,600
we can shortcut a lot of the organic

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
growth that would need to take place for

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,400
a community

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,760
to achieve a milestone along their

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,799
vision goal

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,480
so us putting six engineers into a piece

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,320
of work for three months

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,840
could shortcut something by 12 months or

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,159
longer which is fantastic from a

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
community perspective

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,440
and the last point is about stronger

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,440
collaboration

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,600
and a deeper sense of association with

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,520
the project so open source developers

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,640
have a very strong

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,640
um relationship with the project they

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,520
really associated with it they identify

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,520
themselves

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,840
as a fedorian or words to that effect

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,120
when you have a team that is constantly

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,120
investing their time

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,120
and constantly delivering and moving

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
that vision statement forward and adding

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,400
value

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,279
the community reciprocate that and they

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
want to come back

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,640
and work with you on bug fixes on

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,039
feedback

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,640
on giving you the tools for your team to

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,440
succeed and move forward because

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,360
ultimately it helps the project and that

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,120
creates a tighter association with the

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,960
project which will hopefully lead to

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,360
longer retention within the project's

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
domain

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,440
and this should be obvious but it is a

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
journey and

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,679
we're not just changing how our team

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,760
works at an agile level we're changing

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,520
the habits that have been brought up

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,960
and ingrained for several years in the

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,480
open source community

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,000
well we're trying to do this in the open

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,600
which means there's a spotlight on us

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
and that brings its own pressures and

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,080
its own

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,679
um unique challenges uh with it as well

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,000
you're also trying to change the

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,320
community's perception of your team

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,039
now red hat has been very lucky as a

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,679
sponsor

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,320
and a guide really for fedora for many

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,760
years and similarly with sent to us

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
but that's not going to be the case for

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,360
every enterprise team engaging with this

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,000
the community might be very wary of your

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,600
team

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,159
especially if your team and your

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,240
enterprise is monopolizing the community

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,919
and making a lot of dollars out of it so

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,000
you have to work on the community's

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,520
perception of your team your product

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,799
and your overall company but for me

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:04,000
this has been a very um

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,120
enlightening experience about the flavor

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,440
of agile that has

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,520
merged within the team it's almost a

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,559
purer form because it's done

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,960
in a transparent and an open way

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,120
and i can give very raw feedback but

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,480
ultimately it will enhance

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,080
the mental agility that a lot of teams

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,240
struggle to achieve

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
most teams get mechanically agile very

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
very quickly they can follow the process

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,960
they can follow the guardrails

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,039
they can do all the things the book or

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,799
their scrum master or their coach tells

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,480
them to do

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,960
but they don't get it up here they don't

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,200
get it in their head and this

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,799
open source way of doing it i firmly

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,240
believe is starting to change the

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,000
mindset of our team

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,919
as well as give an appreciation for the

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,360
community for what agile is and isn't

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,640
and that everybody is the end of my

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,960
presentation

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,679
that's my email address and i'm on

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
twitter
