In a world that has become increasingly dependent on organization level data sharing and collaboration for decision making, it is of utmost importance that we ensure airtight security for our data. That's when Apache Ranger comes to the rescue.

Ranger is handy in designing and dictating security policies for Hadoop and its components. Ranger currently provides a centralised security administration, access control and detailed auditing for user access within the Hadoop, Hive, HBase and other Apache components. Also, Meta data these days, speak volumes about the data it encases. This is where we can harness the capabilities of Apache Atlas to work in tandem with Apache Ranger, to build a robust data governance policy for any organization.
