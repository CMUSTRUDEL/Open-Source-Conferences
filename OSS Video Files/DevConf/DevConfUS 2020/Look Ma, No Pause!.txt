Description: 
	Speaker: Peter Hunt

The pause container is a quinnessential hack for Kubernetes pods. A pause container is the first container in a pod, pauses until it is terminated, and is used to hold Linux namespaces open for the lifespan of the pod. Even though the pause container is as minimal as possible, it still has overhead, and we can do better.
CRI-O now has the option to only run a pause container when absolutely necessary. Join Peter Hunt for a deep dive into the implementation details of dropping the pause container, as well as a performance comparison and discussion of other benefits. Attendees will participate in a conversation about the removal of this hack from Kubernetes.
