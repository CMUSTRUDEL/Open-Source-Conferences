Description: 
	Speaker: Talia Kaplanian

The OpenProvisioning proof-of-concept provides a system to prove an Agile Integration methodology leveraging containers, APIs, and Distributed Integration for the purpose of provisioning resources. This lightning talk is a brief introduction to the origin, functionality, and purpose of the OpenProvisioning proof-of-concept told in a unique, story-like-fashion by Talia Kaplanian, a Quality Engineering Intern on the Central Continuous Infrastructure and Tooling team at Red Hat.

miss talia coplanian and i'm a junior

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,160
computer science and biology double

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
major at boston college

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,759
and i'm currently working as a quality

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,679
engineering intern on the central ci and

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,440
tooling team at red hat

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,199
today i'm going to take you through the

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
tale of the open provisioning proof of

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
concept

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
the tale i'm about to share with you is

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,480
based on a true story and like many true

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
stories that abstract complex moral

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,039
teachings

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
this one abstracts the project that i

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,720
had been working on this summer

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
a tool for teams to provision resources

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,040
using an agile integration methodology

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
leveraging containers apis and

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,000
distributed integration

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
what is provisioning might you ask

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
provisioning is fundamentally the

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,000
process of setting up it infrastructure

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,079
or

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
allocating data and resources and making

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,960
them available

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
while this definition feels a little

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
technical one might compare the process

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,039
of provisioning to baking mini cakes

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
with lots of flavors and layers and

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
textures

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,239
and so our story begins once upon a time

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,199
there was a man named paul cormier who

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,879
moved to a town

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,680
famous for its annual cake day

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
celebration while intentions were pure

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,159
to celebrate cake in all of its glory

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,119
the reality of the celebration was quite

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,799
tragic

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640
everyone in the town wanted to bake

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
their own cake with their own tools and

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
their own unique combinations of flavors

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,040
and it was a mess

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,360
paul thought to himself that this seemed

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
like a lot of unnecessary work

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,600
to make a new flavor or add new toppings

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,280
doesn't change the fundamental building

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,119
blocks of a cake right

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
so if everyone in town wanted to bake a

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,000
cake for cake day

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
couldn't there be a way to standardize

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
all of those common steps

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
paul thought heavily about this when

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
there was suddenly a knock at his front

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
door

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
paul opened it to find a flyer on his

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,520
doorstep

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,799
a desperate call to arms no more chaotic

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
cake days

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
but paul had seen these flyers before mr

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
holloway a freelance baker on the other

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,119
side of town had been posting flyers

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
giving speeches in the town square and

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,320
trying to recruit locals for a machine

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,719
that he wanted to build

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
that would streamline the baking process

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,759
paul hadn't heard of anyone giving him

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
the light of day but now he was

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
intrigued

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
so he paid a visit to mr holloway upon

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
arriving paul recounted his thought

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
process to mr holloway

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
and found that the both of them were

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
very much on the same page

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
together they began the process of

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,720
building this machine

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
the premise being that paul would be

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,280
able to choose all of the components of

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
his cake

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,879
from a set menu of options and the

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
machine would make the cake and return

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
it to paul

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,760
paul would not have to provide any

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,360
ingredients tools or special notes

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,680
except for the exact cake that he wanted

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,360
mr holloway also recommended the use of

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
openshift metals and gears

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,959
the best in the world and the only ones

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,440
that would allow them to host his

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,120
order taking menu software in order to

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,680
ease the trouble of switching out the

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,239
machine's

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,360
internal tools as they became outdated

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
or they broke

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
like ovens and stirring utensils paul mr

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
holloway

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
used universal adapters to connect to

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
the mainframe of the machine

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
and finally after much hard work the

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,319
machine was complete

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
paul and mr holloway took their machine

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,200
to the town square to present it to

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,720
everyone as the solution to cake day

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,720
paul began his demonstration and

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,879
selected the components of his cake

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,239
he chose a three-layer cake vanilla on

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
the bottom with boston cream

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,080
on top followed by darkest chocolate

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,879
with chocolate ganache raspberries and

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
walnuts

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,760
and finished with a red velvet tier with

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,760
vanilla buttercream and shredded almonds

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
the machine worried and sputtered and

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
did some magic

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,360
and out the other side came paul's cake

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
the crowd was silent then one voice

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
called out

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
i'm allergic to nuts your machine is

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
useless to me

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
another said i'm gluten free does your

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
machine know how to make a gluten-free

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,080
cake

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
i don't think so one more said i have

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,239
sensitive teeth

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
i need a soft cake tell it i want a soft

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,000
cake

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,239
and many more voices to wind along paul

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,480
quickly quieted the crowd and then spoke

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
you're right my machine doesn't support

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
those things

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
but all you have to do to change that

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
and make it work for your cake

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,920
is to plug in a new tool if you remember

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,680
paul mr holloway used universal adapters

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
so that any tool could be replaced when

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,239
needed

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,320
by doing this however they were actually

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,000
able to hit two birds with one stone

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,000
when someone down the line wanted to add

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
a new flavor or type of cake

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,280
all they would have to do is plug in

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,720
another tool with the universal port

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
now the story ties directly to the

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
project that i've been working on this

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
summer

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,160
the cake machine is representative of

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
the open provisioning proof of concept

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
that we're building and all of the

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,600
features translate directly

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,440
to the features of our poc except our

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,479
machine creates system environments for

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,560
red hatters

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,000
with tools like beaker and openstack and

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,840
we'll soon be adding even more

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
functionality through other tools

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,520
with our easy back-end connection that

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
causes little to no change to the user

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,800
experience

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
mr holloway is a real person and the

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
actual lead developer and godfather of

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
this project

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
paul cormier is also a real person and

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
if you don't already know

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
he was sadly not a part of the actual

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,919
poc

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,000
and unfortunately cake day is not real

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,120
but it could be we could have a red hat

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,960
cake day

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
i'm just saying i'm looking at you

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,280
people team

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
anyways thank you all for listening i

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,400
hope you enjoyed it if you have any

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
questions or want to learn more about

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,720
the poc

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400
feel free to shoot me an email and i'll

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
happily get back to you or visit our

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,199
confluence page that was linked in the

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
last slide

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,639
and you can find the answers to remember

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,639
your questions there see you all later

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,720
thank you very much talia would you like

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,840
to come on video and

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
answer any questions

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,160
hello hey that was very well done

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,560
excellent presentation thank you i had a

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,400
lot of fun with it

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,280
yeah it's a very good format i hadn't

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,280
seen that done before

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,880
so does anyone have questions for talia

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:08,639
she is here with us

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:21,360
we have 11 folks here you're talking

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:23,440
several people that run long so

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
it's like uh i don't know if you're

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,919
seeing the chat but it looks like people

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:32,639
really enjoyed your presentation so

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,639
i i appreciate the intern support here

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
it was an excellent job thank you

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,520
okay well do you have anything you want

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,639
to add or anything you want to say

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,960
um no oh

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,720
you have a question so uh

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,720
asked how did you think about this idea

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,840
of presentation

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,560
um i uh i had actually reached out to a

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,360
number

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
another person on my team asking for

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
some advice

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
um had to do a technical presentation

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,560
i've never done one before

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,680
and the two things that he said that

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,560
really stuck with me

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,759
were make sure you tell it like a story

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
like start with the origin of the

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,400
project and then talk about the

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
different conflicts you went through and

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,599
then

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
um how you resolved it um and then he

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
also said to have fun with it

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,080
literally

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,759

anyone who's watching it if i talk about

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,000

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,680
not be paying attention anymore after a

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,440
couple of minutes and so

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
if i could make it more fun and make

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,400
people understand it in an easier way

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,800
