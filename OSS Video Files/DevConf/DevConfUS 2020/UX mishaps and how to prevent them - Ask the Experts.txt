00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,880
mishaps and ultimately help us learn how

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
to prevent them in the future

why were they so bad what were the

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,960
ramifications

for the last nine years engaged in

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,239
working together with uxd team

katherine group i'm proud

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,239
what we accomplished together but i

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,360
think i've been invited

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,879
here because all the countless horror

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
stories that i accumulate over their

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,200
years

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
that's great thanks alex and dana sure

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,720
hi my name is dana

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,319
gutride so i work as a manager with user

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
experience and design team here at red

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,879
hat

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,879
and i still get to write code when they

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,599
let me periodically so that's been my

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
my my first love was front end

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,040
development been doing that for about

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,400
the last 20 years or so and for now my

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,760
focus has been on

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
patternfly which is our open source

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,239
design system but we also have

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,159
uh code and components in it and i also

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,599
help support our front-end developers

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
uh on various red hat products

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,800
great we already have

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,360
our first question i'll ask this group

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
what has been the ux mishap you've seen

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,239
out there

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,920
that caused a large scale shift in how

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,920
we think about user experiences

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,159
yeah so i actually talked about this one

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,280
in my talk earlier

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,720
um facebook is one that really

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,280
comes to mind as kind of a spectacular

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,080
mishap out there as far as user

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,519
experience

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,080
um you know the the facebook privacy

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
uh capabilities have been called into

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159
the public eye

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,760
and that's um

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,280
been really a challenge i think for

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,760
facebook to figure out

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
you know how to handle so much attention

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,799
on

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,599
uh some experiences around um

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,640
you know user privacy and data control

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,640
and how to offer those

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,079
yeah facebook's an interesting one

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,759
because there's like how you view it

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,720
professionally and then how you view it

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
personally so

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
sometimes those two things mix um i

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,919
always stayed away personally from

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
creating a facebook account because it

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,919
made me

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
really nervous putting that much

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,560
information out there as a developer

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
knowing how much damage i could do when

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,080
i write bad code and

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,520
being nervous saying okay everyone's

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
just human

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
but staying away watching this

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,960
reinforced my personal decision saying

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
okay i think i dodged a bullet by

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
staying away but as a developer

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,400
it made me think even more about just

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
how much responsibility we have

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
when dealing with people's information

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,199
and how easy it is

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,199
to get into a situation where

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,360
we make mistakes or things just get out

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,720
of hand we're trying to try to

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
to put these features in place

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,120
i'm going to get a little more

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,000
philosophical and say it's not just

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,360
facebook but

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,720
social media in general and kind of how

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,840
i see it is you know this

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,759
you know users placed a trust in these

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,120
applications to protect their data and

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,440
that's clearly not what happened i don't

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,919
know

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,120
where that first assumption came from

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,720
that original like

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
yes they're going to do everything right

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,840
for me

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,280
so to me it becomes from a user

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,360
experience perspective

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,479
this sort of you know balancing act

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,960
between like

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,360
what you know user expectations were and

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
what reality actually was and i don't

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
i don't know where the source of all

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,720
that that source of truth like from that

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
angle came from but that's how i kind of

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
see that whole

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
yeah i kind of had a full arc of

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,840
experiences

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
um with

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,520
as a myspace user and kind of followed

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,639
um other friends onto facebook

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,000
and i always have a probably a healthy

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,120
skeptical eye

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,240
towards social technologies

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,120
and i think it was a little i worked for

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,199
a while um

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
on the security team of an e-commerce

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
company and learned a lot about

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,199
you know things that the end user

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,919
doesn't see for privacy

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
and seeing that you know shortly after

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,440
play out

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,199
um for facebook it you know really

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,680
reinforced why i had come in

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,800
um a little bit more skeptical and then

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
i shortly after

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,199
after just about out of facebook because

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,639
i feel very similar to rocks that the

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
least they can do

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
is for us with all of the information we

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,440
give them

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,160
is be respectful of our privacy i mean

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
that's really

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
the least we can do they can do it for

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
their users so

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,080
um yeah that's definitely a big

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,560
ux mishap in my book

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,880
yeah and i think it's it's great to like

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,639
you know have a industry example that's

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,599
so clear out there that everybody can

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,560
maybe relate to

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,039
but you know since we're all red hatters

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
here

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,800
uh maybe it's good to turn the eye on

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
ourselves and look at our own mishaps

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
too

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,440
um alex i remember you know when i first

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,639
came to red hat

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,680
the jbpm team was working on some social

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,880
speech that a little bit

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,400
ah yes so that's one

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:34,639
one one of those mishaps that happen so

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,639
year 2012 we have a new member

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,759
coming to the team we need to find a

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,880
work that was

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
out of critical path so so this new

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,560
member

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,520
would explore the technology but deliver

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
something that

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,680
is not exactly part of our commitment

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
2012 what we can do the best idea that i

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
have

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,720
let's add a social platform integrator

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,120
like a social aspect to the platform

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,680
the context is we are an enterprise

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,360
software for business application

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,520
i don't think they are much willing to

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,120
get social interaction they just want to

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,080
have their work done

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
and the context of that is like it's

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
kind of

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
a bunch of developers working creating

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,360
business process

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,039
business rules the context for process

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
would be

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,319
more focused on another thing but we

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,680
created

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,959
the social feature it was exciting

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,240
by a lot of things that we could imagine

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:41,039
and and because this is a new

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,240
um engineer coming he he wanted to show

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,959
some good work right and of course we

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,880
over engineered the whole feature it was

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,920
super complex

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,959
so it was not just to display things but

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,000
how we treated

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,720
the followers the unfollowing and how

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,839
just to

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,040
build the events and how to do things

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,920
so that was an impressive

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
uh situation that we created for mishap

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,920
because

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,399
definitely that was not the the proper

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
place

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,760
to add social features

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,680
um it reminds me so much of like

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,040
you know this desire to want to be

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,360
innovative and to

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,560
like adopt new technology without always

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
considering if it's

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,640
really appropriate for that moment i i

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,880
can tell you even over the last

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,560
even the last week you know i've been

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,120
working with my team on some designs and

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
we're trying

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,080
so so hard to put in this this this it's

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
not new but it's like it's new for

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,160
the industry right it's new for web app

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
or enterprise applications and

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,760
you know every time we run these

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,120
beautiful designs by all and you know by

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,959
all intents and purposes

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
by the customer they're like yeah i just

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
want a table

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,680
every time so you deflate a little bit

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,240
right because you're like oh okay but

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,760
i think what the example you gave alex

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
reminds me so much of that like we're

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
trying

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
we want to be innovative we want to be

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,760
creative and sometimes it's to our own

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
detriment

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,839
yeah and and there is also consequence

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,160
of the feature right

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
because it goes beyond just the some

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,920
screens in the ui

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
um it goes towards the infrastructure

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,760
that i had to put in place

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
we have just one thread just to listen

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,640
to events

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,760
in another thread that would create a

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,760
new

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,680
another events and we had a third thread

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,519
that had to serialize that so we don't

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,440
want to lose the events right

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,839
it's a social place we don't want to

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
miss anything that other engineers were

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,440
that i'm falling they're doing open a

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,000
file close a file

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,880
everything was generating actions in the

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
system so

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,600
we create a lot of back-end

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,000
infrastructure that was

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
not helping that that by this way

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,800
the social aspect that was pretty common

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,959
across a lot of enterprise

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,959
right i remember where i worked um even

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,800
before red hat that was such a big thing

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,240
they're looking at a lot of social media

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
starting up saying how can we embed this

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
in our application

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,680
and it was around a similar time that

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,399
other thing that something similar was

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,959
happening not

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,640
with social assets but looking at other

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,399
technology and saying can we

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,839
adopt it really quickly so one thing

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,240
that happened to us was

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,440
it cost years of time was was the advent

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,920
of flash

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
in enterprise software so there was this

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,680
thing that came on called flex

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,240
back in the late 2000s 2006 2007

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,040
macromedia and then adobe introduced it

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,480
and a lot of

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
enterprise software like this is going

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,399
to be great for making dashboards

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
because it will look the same everywhere

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,120
we put it and you didn't have to worry

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,320
about browsers and

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
all these other problems we said we'll

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
just use flash as a way of delivering

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
that

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,200
um and we jumped on that bandwagon spent

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,240
a long time building out some flex

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
dashboards because they could be

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,959
compiled they felt very

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,720
enterprise-ish um but then and i started

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,480
looking at the history like what what

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,639
happened what blew up with that

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
and then it was shocking because it was

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,399
steve jobs

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
wrote this open letter about thoughts on

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,320
flash

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
and it just completely blew the whole

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
thing up the

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,279
ceo of adobe responds and everyone

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
starts taking sides in the android and

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
apple

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,279
and everyone's like we don't want to run

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,079
this on our mobile device platform

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,800
but it effectively killed it and i think

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,040
in 20

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
right this this year sometime a lot of

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,760
browsers are going to

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,680
finally stop it it's just going to be

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
completely disabled with absolutely no

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,680
hope of getting it running

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,399
so i had sort of a slow death but in

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
terms of

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,600
an experience problem where all this

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
stuff that we built just had to

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,920
disappear

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,040
it was a pretty big one for us i have a

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,079
good experience

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,000
around also flash um we i

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,839
had to be involved on a proprietary

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
system that was all based in flash that

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,480
we had to convert to

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,120
standards html css javascript

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,240
back in the days but and one thing that

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,000
i want to

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,920
in the context of red hat that i was

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,160
talking here is like

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,360
i i mentioned the mishap that happened

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
on jbpm

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,480
that was that was a mishap but that's

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,720
the

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,760
advantage of open source perspective

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,680
because this

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,320
all was done on community and uh

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,800
in in baking time in community before

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,240
becoming part of a product and roll out

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,800
these two main enterprise customers out

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,760
there

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,440
so we have the baking time to get the

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,000
feedback and say

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
and working close with category and work

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,519
of the teams that

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,160
reassess re-evaluate is this the best

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,760
option

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,639
is it that that was i think a very

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,040
appealing for us at least my perspective

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:49,839
that

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:49,839
open source helps a lot how our model is

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
even more and i think that that bridges

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,399
really well

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
into those questions that just came down

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
and

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,720
thinking about open source in these

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,720
terms of do you think these

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,120
organizations and projects were able to

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,120
come back from these ux mishaps

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,440
yeah that's a great question um you know

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,680
i think alex just gave a great example

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,720
of how you can kind of save yourself

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,480
before you

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:24,079
cross the line of no return

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,040
i think you know in facebook's um

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,639
situation they they certainly might have

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
crossed that line of no return with a

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,360
good

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,639
uh part of their market uh there's of

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,680
course people that will

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,560
stick with facebook forever those that

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
won't but

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,399
they've really tarnished their brand um

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,399
with that quite a bit and i think it's

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,560
pretty hard when you actually

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,240
you know impact the your brand

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,360
reputation and what people

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,920
perceive as what your value is and what

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,079
um

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,760
you're willing to do for them uh that

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,440
can be really really difficult to

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,920
recover from

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,800
and just to add on what kat was saying

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,760
um

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,279
you know that aside from social media in

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
general in my mind being tarnished right

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
now everyone's

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
you're always a skeptic what are you

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
signing up for what are you giving away

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,360
but they had

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,560
you know the eye of the government

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
turned on them right

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,720
it's not just with the users i mean the

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
the federal government is looking at

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
them looking at the industry in general

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,600
and saying what's going on here so

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,440
um recovery i mean they're so big

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
probably but like what does that what

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
does that mean i mean look

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,320
sound looks like a big headache to me

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
but

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,040
yeah yeah such an interesting problem

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,880
because

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,320
i think facebook damaged their own

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,160
reputation but did they

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,000
damage the idea of social media as a

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,560
whole like kids still

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,160
love sharing things about themselves and

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,759
it's just basically it's just the next

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,000
thing so now it's

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,959
well you could say one now and it would

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,639
be gone in

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,360
a week or two if somebody watches a

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,759
recording here so it moves so fast so

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,680
i think it's just made a lot of people

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,079
very skeptical like you're saying about

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,519
privacy and then just people make a

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
decision like do i put everything out

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,279
there just know that it's going to be

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
open

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,839
and i have no choice and it'll just be

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,120
there forever and i think a lot of

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,959
people are becoming

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,639
especially younger people either very

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
comfortable that or very resistant and

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
just kind of divide

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,519
created this bigger divide in in how

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,720
people feel about security

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,920
yeah and uh talking about the case that

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,440
i was more involved

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,399
right i i think we we managed to come

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
back somehow

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,160
if we can show some slides i think we

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,040
progress a lot

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,040
to just to have this process to baking

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,920
community get interactions

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,040
get the working clothes definitely with

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,839
uxd team

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,920
that was like in the beginning was just

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,519
a bunch of engineers playing around the

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,839
platform that were just

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,800
web tools and now it's becoming more

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,880
structured

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,680
things are having processed so we

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,920
evolved quite a lot from there

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,800
at least i like to to think about that

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,120
that way

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,000
and that's one of the one of the amazing

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,240
aspects of

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,280
of open source right is it compare it

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
can pair

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,360
different roles together so in a world

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,880
where engineers maybe only would have

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,480
ever interacted with engineers you now

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
do have the ability to interact

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,839
with people of different roles there

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,439
could be a content person there there

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,120
could be a uxd person there all

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,880
for the love of that project or for the

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
you know dedication of that project

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,559
you have that resource available that

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,559
you you might not have had before

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,720
yeah i'm thinking about that flash

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,240
example as well

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,600
and i'm thinking back to um

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,640
when i would go to these pages on these

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,039
brands that i

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
really cared about and it would just be

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,440
like a flash

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
splash page that would stop me from like

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,320
purchasing

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,799
or buying or anything like that and i'm

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
thinking were these brands able to

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,039
recover

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,360
from that like slow stop

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,960
you know full experience and then maybe

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,039
you don't make it to the pathway

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
that you um had originally intended to

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,000
go down um

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,880
so what do you think dana do you think

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,440
they were able to recover

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
yeah well i mean a lot of code changes

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,880
and turns

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,440
so quickly that you just wait a little

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,400
while

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,679
and then as long as you're still

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
building things and you haven't lost all

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,360
your customers it's usually okay

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,960
um for this project we pretty much

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,640
deleted any code that

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,559
was built for flash and just started

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,880
fresh so it was probably two to three

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,679
years worth of a developer or two's

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,080
time that was lost i think the bigger

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,679
thing i learned from that is that

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,600
being aware of what direction the

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,720
industry is shifting in and not

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,200
fighting it is a really key skill to

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,200
learn

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
as a developer and especially in the the

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,080
user experience space because you're

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
right on the cutting edge

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
and things will shift so fast with

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,200
people's phones and devices introducing

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
technology

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,400
that if you can't respond to it you're

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
like no i love this technology i'm going

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
to stick with it until i

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,960
until my dying day you're that's you're

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,360
just going to be stuck with it and

00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,280
people

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
are probably going to abandon what

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
you've built so that's something that

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
i've

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,039
tried to take away from it is that you

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,799
have to be aware where the industry is

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
going and as soon as you start to see

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,840
those things coming up in this

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,240
groundswell where everyone's going in a

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,200
direction you're better off not fighting

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,440
it even if

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,799
even if they're wrong and you say hey

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,080
that's not the right technology and you

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,679
know it in your heart

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,320
it's it's not going to matter because

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,679
things will shift so fast

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,679
yeah i think one of the things that i've

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,760
learned in this industry uh you know

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,520
watching all of these technology changes

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,000
like dana's been saying

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,919
is that you just like especially from a

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
designer perspective

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,360
you have to not get caught up in all of

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,679
those technology changes your

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,200
engineering teams are like super excited

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
about it and you have to like create a

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,840
little bit of a wall there and be like

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,080
that's great but i need to focus on the

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,280
user and design what they need and

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,360
you can play around with whatever

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,640
technology helps you achieve that

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,840
but let's just focus on the right design

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,360
um and and so often in this industry you

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,320
know we all get caught up

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,120
in those kind of ground wave uh

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,880
movements

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,880
around you know social media around

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,919
new technologies around everything else

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,760
and it's

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,880
you have to take that step back and keep

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,039
a level head sometimes

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
but um i know for from a design

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,520
perspective i mean

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
what's the saying throwing the baby out

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,760
with the bath water you have to get used

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
to it

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,039
i joke with i joke with customers and

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,480
people that i meet with like

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,840
don't worry you can tear the design

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
apart it's fine i'm not emotionally

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,720
invested i've

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,120
i've matured in my career where it's

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,480
like okay okay feedback is good

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,320
what do we got to change here you know

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
not to get not to think that the way

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,919
that i did it was absolutely the right

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,240
way

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,000
friend of mine who is a designer his

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,520
tagline is strong

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,520
opinions loosely held

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:55,200
yeah that's right and i i feel like that

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,960
um that like sentiment of of like

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,440
loosely holding our our showing opinions

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,720
like

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,679
really functions well in the open source

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
community

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,039
um where we're hearing a lot of

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,120
different

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:14,159
and um we have a lot of valid

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,799
thoughts being put into

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,640
the pool of things to be considered like

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,880
design engineering beyond

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,480
like you know it all comes to the table

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,400
and that's what we love about open

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
source and that's why we're here

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
and i think that this next question

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,919
really speaks to that which is

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,919
in what ways can or prevent

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,200
yeah i think we touched on that a little

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,320
bit i mean the fact that we get

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,520
this technology out in front of users

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,080
in sort of like a very beta way

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,039
uh before we're releasing it in in our

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,480
enterprise

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,480
kind of ga ready mode is um

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,679
really advantageous and beyond that

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,760
because we're actually

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,520
building it in that upstream we're

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,679
building it in a transparent and open

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,000
way where others can participate

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,080
it means that you get a very large

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,679
diversity of opinions

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,919
you can really gut check some of those

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,200
decisions along the way so that maybe

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,919
you know if you're about to make a

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,760
mishap

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,760
you have a whole community of people

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,960
jump in and have an opinion about that

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
situation

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320
and sometimes that can be super rough

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,039
like you

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,240
when you're not ready for that uh level

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,960
of

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,360
feedback and opinion um that that can

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,240
feel

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,400
really tough but at the end of the day

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,880
it's part of what makes open source so

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,360
great

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,080
is because we can have that diversity of

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,799
opinion

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,559
um have those conversations in the

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,799
upstream in the community

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,679
and then uh come out the door with a

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,120
much better

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,799
and stronger and more like ethically

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,840
sound and everything else project

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,960
yeah and adding to that it's like that

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,520
you said

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,679
cat there is the passion people involved

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,880
in community they are passionate

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,280
usually they they care a lot and

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,360
the feedback is candid in that way that

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,919
that came with passion

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,400
sometimes a little bit too much passion

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
that

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,320
that that what happens but it just

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,679
it opens so much in the world that we're

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,559
being talking percent

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,440
not it has been really in the in the

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,280
media today

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
that's the diversity that we're talking

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,039
here in open source

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,159
in a community that's across the globe

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,960
you have people

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,320
around the world having their inputs and

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,679
that's a very unique

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,400
position that you have uh eyes of the

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,720
world

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,559
consuming and contributing and

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,679
passionate about the technology that you

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,480
are building

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,360
and that i don't think it prevents the

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,720
mishaps

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,240
but it gives you during this baking time

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,520
that you just mentioned that

00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,880
you you put something very awful better

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,080
stage you can adjust quickly

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,520
you have a a way to to understand the

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,000
feedback

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,679
that's not in the traditional closed

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,919
source

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,799
environments or proprietary technology

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,240
that

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,240
it's running and i bet all of us have an

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,720
experience with a software or anything

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,600
that

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,799
oh i just wanted to submit a pull

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,360
request there that

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,320
fixed this annoying issue that i face

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,919
every day

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,919
using whatever software we do

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
i just need to echo again what what al

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
saying i mean

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,400
i know that the upstreams that i'm

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,559
involved in a lot of them are global and

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
i i cannot tell you the value that comes

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,240
out of

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,000
a global set of eyes it's it's no longer

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,360
even from a cultural standpoint

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,880
there's super there's there's a

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
tremendous amount of value in the

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,440
perspective they see

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
on the work that i do when i've

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,520
submitted even visual design work up to

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,960
the upstream community i

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,799
that's been that's been frankly i i mean

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,520
it would make my job so much harder not

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,520
to have them there

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,799
yeah i like having a community for the

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
code to work on i think another aspect

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,919
for

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,600
for some of these mishaps is if is if

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,440
the code had been open

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,360
it would have been so much harder to

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,960
hide from people what was happening with

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,880
their personal information

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,720
because people would have just dug in

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
said okay this is the stream of where my

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,799
data is going

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,640
you know what's being done with it and

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,600
they would have been able to see

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,640
how it's being stored and and and all

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,480
those pieces so

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,240
it makes it a lot harder for for

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,520
companies or anyone who's maybe not

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,279
behaving in

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,039
an upstanding way to hide what they're

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,320
doing or when they are and they say hey

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,840
really you can trust us they can just

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,640
say hey go look at the code if you have

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,159
a question

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
and it's right there and that makes a

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,880
huge difference

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,480
yeah now i've gotten used to that level

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,360
of accountability

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,320
and when i'm like contributing to an

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,720
open source

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,000
design system i really depend on that

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,400
feedback and

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
you know maybe in other environments i

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,039
would have to

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,760
um you know pull that out of um of

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,279
others and

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,200
i just i just love that folks bring it

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,919
to the table and from

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,080
different backgrounds as well um and and

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,679
early on you know it's better to learn

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,559
about something early than

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,400
than later after the fact so yeah i i

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,000
just think that's really well said

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,200
and um i thought that

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,799
a really fun question came in that i

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,679
think it's a good thing

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,320
for us to wrap up on today which is

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,200
what's

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,679
one ux mishap that you've had with this

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,720
new

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,200
work remote environment and how did you

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,919
get through it i think we've all had

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,480
one of these come up maybe a few maybe

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,520
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,440
maybe more through this time so i would

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,279
love to hear about your experiences

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,679
and i share that with the group virtual

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,679
school

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,400
so good if virtual school was open

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,039
source

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,039
i wouldn't have probably 75 of the

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,919
problems i have going on with the

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,320
login and log out of chromebooks of you

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
know

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,679
single sign-ons from other systems

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
overwriting chromebooks chromebooks

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,440
overriding

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,559
single sign-ons oh my goodness we need

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,320
another session

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,559
for this yeah it happened

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,240
you just mentioned it just happens now

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,799
i'm facing a problem that i

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,000
the school it cannot solve yet during

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,799
the summer

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,080
my son got access to his account the

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,200
school account

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,159
and he changed the password fine enough

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,799
this the chromebooks are were delivered

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,200
so he

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,080
logged in in the because it used the

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,960
google account

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,960
right but they school set up a lot of

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
other applications

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,679
with that default password but connected

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,559
to the google account

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,600
what happens now is he cannot access any

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,760
application

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,840
so just the google classroom but other

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,960
application videos he's blocking

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,360
everything and because the password is

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,039
just

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,880
short the original password is just

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,080
short they managed to

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,120
they probably have a communication with

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,640
google directly an api level

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,440
and i cannot send it back to be able to

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,440
work so

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,960
at this point nobody can change his

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,520
password to original one

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,200
and the other applications still have

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,320
the the original that

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,320
is uncompatible it was almost the

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,240
opposite i had to buy a

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
chromebook for my daughter so it ties to

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,520
a gmail account

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,279
so when she would go to log into google

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,000
classroom because it's a chromebook

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,840
it's trying to use her personal gmail

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,240
it's overriding the school's

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,520
authentication needed to actually access

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,360
google classroom

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,640
i mean i have to say we're pretty lucky

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,799
because we actually understand how these

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,600
workflows work otherwise i mean it could

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,039
it would have taken

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,120
apparent weeks to figure this out i

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,480
figured it out in a few hours but still

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,240
i mean oh my goodness it was very

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,720
frustrating

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
the whole environment's fascinating it's

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,320
just so amazing to watch

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,840
what's happening and i have to give

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,279
these teachers so much credit

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,919
for trying to figure these things out on

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,440
for the moment it's it's amazing what

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,279
they're what they're doing in this

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,559
state right now but i my daughter asks

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,919
me how come every time i walk by the

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,240
table i shake my head

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,600
or i sigh and it's it's like scarlett

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,520
that's my daughter

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,240
it's like all of your classes either the

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,240
teacher can't hear any of the students

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,520
her microphone's not working the

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,120
screen's not showing

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,720
the slides that she shared with the

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,200
students aren't working or when they

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,640
click on a video nothing happens

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,080
so and then she says well you all have

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,960
to make copies of the slides and then

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,880
you hear like

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,320
kevin from down the street like saying

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,360
well this is how you do it you click the

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,120
file menu and

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,120
these 11 year olds are all helping each

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,360
other and the teacher

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,320
half like today at least two of her

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,240
classes were just

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,919
canceled after 15 minutes not because

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,240
the students couldn't connect

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,679
but because the teacher trying to use it

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,520
wasn't able to get

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,279
the equipment connected so that she

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,360
could teach the students and i just

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,320
i i feel so bad for them it's a huge

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,120
usability

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,840
problem because it's likely that their

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
headset

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,200
and whatever equipment they have

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,600
connected just something disconnected or

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,080
chopped

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
you know a different output all of a

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,760
sudden became selected

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,600
and then the teacher was just not able

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,360
to get it back working again and it's

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,279
you think about just something as simple

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,240
as just i want my headphones to keep

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,480
working for

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,159
six hours straight which should be a

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,159
relatively simple thing

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,799
is almost is almost impossible to get

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,320
working consistently for them

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,320
yeah we actually um just had a situation

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,279
where we had somebody interview with red

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,559
hat where their

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,039
headphones swapped from the computer to

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,760
their phone midway through the interview

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,760
and so

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,840
we couldn't hear them and they were

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,760
presenting so they couldn't see the

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,000
screen where everybody was trying to get

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,960
their

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
attention to say like hello we can't we

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,480
can't

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,399
talk to you anymore like you're you're

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,240
presenting but

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,000
there's nothing we can do over here and

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,960
so you know these

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,519
technology kind of mishaps that happen

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,480
with

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,840
um presenting and classrooms and video

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,320
conferences

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,399
it's a real challenge when that's our

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,840
like one way to communicate with each

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,840
other right now

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
man

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,519
imagine an open source community of like

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,640
kindergarten parents they would have it

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,840
worked out with a 30

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,919
every parent in the world would be

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,320
logged in hammering away at the system

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,440
no they'd all be on irc roxanne they

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,399
would just

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,960
say we're just going to go just text

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,960
messaging

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,320
what i think about is how adept all of

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,240
these

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,600
students are going to be at these tools

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,960
i mean here i am look

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,519
like kat was saying looking for my

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,000
screen share you know waving at people

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,200
uh like tell me if i'm not sharing and

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,120
then accidentally close

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
closing out of the google meet so i

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,360
think we still have some usability uh

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,039
things to work out for these for these

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,360
young students and you know they'll be

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,640
pros at it by the time

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,799
by the time today yeah

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,480
i have to give pop in a little bit of

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,279
credit because at least they put the

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
leave button

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,600
like way in a different location than

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,320
the rest of them

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,799
somehow that is not a standard practice

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,080
and

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,760
everything in the middle why

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:29,840
yeah front and center

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,840
yeah i love how it's typed out leave

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,120
very part of where you are clicking

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,080
that's amazing

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,919
yeah so um i'm gonna say thank you so

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,559
much to all of our panelists

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,480
um and to all of you for you know all of

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,840
our participants and question askers for

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,840
attending today

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,559
um we um have

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,000
walked away learning that we should

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,159
start early and often

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,760
engaging um with our open source

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,960
communities

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360
when designing anything um so we can

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,120
work

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,880
together to create solutions that meet

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,880
our users needs

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,559
and it's clear that bringing open source

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,760
into the design and development process

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,559
enables

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,320
hero moments and product where we really

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,279
serve our users best

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,720
um those are all the questions you have

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,480
time for today

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,880
