Title: Open Sourcify Your Design Process
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Laura Wright

Have you wondered about what the experience was like for a new packager? This is a talk for you. You might already know what it's like to package software, but you may not realize how your actions affect new maintainers who don't yet have a strong community voice. Join me for a detailed review of my experience as a first time software packager and the community experience associated with building and maintaining packages for Fedora.

all right thank you for hanging in

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,920
everybody next

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,279
up we have open sourcify your design

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,840
process

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,960
by laura wright and over to you laura

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,960
great thank you um hi everyone um my

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,600
name is laura wright i'm an interaction

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
designer

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,960
on the red hat uxd team here i work on

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,519
predominantly openshift but

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,119
i've been at red hat for about three and

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,960
a half years now and i've worked on a

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
couple different products so

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,760
this talk will kind of cover uh mostly

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,320
my experience with working on

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,440
rev as an interaction designer and also

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,800
interacting

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,200
with um the overt community so we can

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,239
get started i guess right when um the

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,239
clock hits 2 30.

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,079
okay great so hi everyone welcome to the

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,879
open source up by your design process

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,559
talk

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,399
today we'll be talking about how you can

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,719
apply an open source approach to the

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,800
design process whether you're

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,760
new to the design process or a seasoned

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,239
veteran

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,000
the goal is to provide you with

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
resources and different methods for

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,880
applying an open source method

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,560
to your design process or open source

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,200
methodologies to your design process

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
so for the agenda of this talk we'll

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
first cover

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,799
exactly what open source is and what the

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
design process is just to level that

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
and then we'll dive into the different

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,159
stages of the design process

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and how and how you can apply open

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,200
source methodologies to those different

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
stages

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,479
we'll also cover the topic of

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,560
contributing design work

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,920
some pros and cons of an open source

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
design process

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
and then we'll wrap up with a conclusion

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
so first what is open source the term

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,439
open source

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,240
according to this opensource.com

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,200
definition

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,320
is a term that refers to something that

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,799
people can modify

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,200
and share because of its design because

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,360
its design is publicly accessible

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,040
so when we talk about open source we

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000
usually talk about it in terms

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,439
of software or code but it applies to

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,599
design as well

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
the definition above directly references

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,720
the word design

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
so why not take more of an open source

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
approach when it comes to the design

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
process as well

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
what is the design process the design

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,280
process is the process that is used to

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,319
come up with solutions to

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,319
a problem in a nutshell the design

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,440
process usually involves some sort of

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,879
discovery

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,040
design and testing phases open source

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
involves principles like transparency

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,879
collaboration

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,000
release early and often meritocracy and

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,080
community

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
and each of these different principles

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,959
can easily be applied to any of these

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
different stages of the design process

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
and when it comes to the design process

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
um there's the concept of user-centered

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
design principles

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,239
and they hold many of the core values

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,040
that open source principles has so

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,159
it seems um that open source principles

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,560
and user-centered

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,400
design principles are more or less one

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,959
of the same when it comes down to the

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
root of it

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,680
so first we'll start off with the

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
discovery stage of the design process

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
at this stage in the design process your

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
goal as the designer is to learn as much

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,239
as you can about the user and the

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,120
problem space

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,159
you can talk to users the community and

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,640
subject matter experts at this stage

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
during this discovery phase your main

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
job is to do

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,680
as much listening absorbing of as much

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
information as you can

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,840
and building empathy and understanding

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,959
to the users that you're designing for

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,640
and with the community that you're

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,799
working with

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
to open certify this step you could

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,840
utilize social media

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,720
channels mailing lists subreddits forms

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
or any other

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,799
direct place where the community is

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
having conversations

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,959
if the community already has established

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,959
communication channels

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
um i would highly recommend using those

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,599
instead of starting new ones there's

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
really no need to

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,120
reinvent the wheel when it comes to

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,560
communicating with the community

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,400
since you really want to meet them where

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,440
they are

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,280
so in my own personal work with working

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,919
with the obert community

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,400
i actually used uh the subreddit so it

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,199
felt kind of funny using reddit as like

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,720
a means of communication for like

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
work-related things but

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
um it proved to be a really great

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,080
communication channel to work with the

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
overt community

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,759
since that community was pretty active

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
and willing to

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
respond and have conversations via the

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,639
subreddit

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,840
so using the subreddit i was able to set

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,120
up user interviews

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,960
post surveys and i also got um input

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
from like just posting or asking

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,360
questions of the over

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,120
subreddit community so it proved to be a

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,240
very useful place to

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,240
connect and talk to folks

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,880
so with using any of these different

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,160
communication channels

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,960
um it always kind of depends on what the

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,600
community

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
um what their history is with either

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
talking to design folks or

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
what level of engagement they kind of

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,080
have like

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,400
because as a designer you're coming

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,720
you're kind of coming in as an outsider

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,320
so you don't want to feel like you're

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,680
going to like rock the butter anyway

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,120
so i always kind of play it a little bit

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,720
uh just open and conversational at first

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,639
and then the more you get to know the

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
community that's when you can maybe

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,240
start asking like more

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,280
hard-hitting questions or like start to

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,919
dig deeper with that conversation

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,280
so just as a general disclaimer these

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,960
are just a couple of the different

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,320
methods that i've used in my own

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
experience

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
i think when it comes to doing open

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,280
source discovery it's pretty free form

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
so if some methods work for you and some

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
do not

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,720
that's totally cool

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,240
so another way that you can open

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,639
sourcify this step

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,400
is depending on how those previous

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
conversations with the community go and

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,800
the amount of interest

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
and response that you get you can set up

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
direct

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,080
either interviews or send out surveys to

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
the community to get even more detailed

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,600
input from them

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
if the community doesn't respond at

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
first that's okay

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,960
um it might take a couple tries to get

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,960
that conver that conversation going

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,560
from my experience with working with the

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,560
overt community

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
there were folks in the in the community

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,840
that were like

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,680
willing and always signed up for like

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,680
surveys or user interviews

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
uh but on occasion you will get folks

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
who will be no shows

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
so when you're either planning um

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,400
especially user interviews since those

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,240
can take a bit more time than just

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
sending out a survey

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,919
and require a good amount of effort on

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,400
the participants side so

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,840
they they might not show up so just keep

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,639
that in mind when you're starting to

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,520
plan out

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,319
any sort of research study or user

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,319
interview schedule

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,039
so for even more transparency at this

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
stage

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,319
you can share a link to your personal

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,160
calendar so

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,759
folks can schedule a time to meet with

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,000
you so

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,400
in this case i was setting up user

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,960
interviews with participants

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,120
in the overt community for um a

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,759
usability study that i was doing so

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,720
i actually opened up my personal google

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
calendar

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,479
and set up appointment slides or slots

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
so

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,240
people could access it and set up a time

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,360
that worked for both them and my

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,599
schedule

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
so this method can feel a little

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
intrusive but

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,080
i think it all just depends on your

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
level of comfort and the amount of

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,440
transparency you want to have

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,680
and i think if you don't want to have

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,639
like that amount of openness that's

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,479
totally fine

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:58,319
i think um if you still want to have

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,280
that sort of connection and um trust in

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,440
the community

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,120
you could create a project specific

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
calendar or email

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,639
so you still have some level of

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,639
anonymity but

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,840
you're still opening yourself up for

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
scheduling and being flexible with the

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
community

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,759
so next comes the design stage

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,240
at this stage in the design process your

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
goal is to start designing solutions

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,080
based off of the information you

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,879
gathered from the discovery stage

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,800
this stage is all about idea generation

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
feedback and iteration are essential and

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,760
constant parts

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,760
of this part of the design process

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,519
to further open sourcify this step you

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,720
could use open source tools like

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,959
 blender inkscape and other similar

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
tools to create your designs

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,720
if you're more comfortable using

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,120
proprietary tools to create your designs

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
that's totally cool too personally i use

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
proprietary tools like

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
sketch and adobe products to create my

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
designs but

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,320
i share my workout in open and

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
accessible formats with the community

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,200
when it comes to sharing out your

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
designs

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,680
i think it's the most important part is

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,920
the sharing out part

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,200
even if you are using proprietary

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,720
software

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,959
the sharing out part is the most

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
important part of an open source design

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,560
process rather than the tools that you

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,519
use

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
instead of um just sharing like the kind

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
of

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,360
like maybe a final pdf or something of

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
your design

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
you could also share out maybe the

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,880
artifacts with the community so it's

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,839
even more accessible to the community if

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,600
they want to like

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,959
play around with your file or update it

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,519
or modify it

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,320
i think that um that sort of approach

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,760
really

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,720
embraces a full open source approach

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
another way to open sourcify this design

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,519
step

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
is you could hold office hours with the

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
community

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
if there's interest in a more

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360
interactive way to engage with the

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,079
design work and

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,040
maybe ask questions or like do kind of

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
on the fly

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,839
signing

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
so after you've generated and sketched

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
out some ideas

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,880
the next step is to get feedback on them

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,680
so

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,600
to open sourcify the act of giving and

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
receiving feedback

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,880
you could share out your designs with

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
the same community that you engaged with

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,160
earlier on in the design process

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,000
just start start to get initial feedback

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
i think getting feedback from the

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
community earlier on

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
or getting feedback from the community

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
earlier on in the design process

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,279
really helps to build a better outcome

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,200
and helps to build a relationship

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,680
of trust um between you and the

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
community

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,600
so to keep track of some of the feedback

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
that you receive

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,800
you could write it down in a document or

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,279
spreadsheet for extra shareability

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,399
i think it's really important to follow

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,160
up with the

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
follow up with the community on design

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,600
updates you make

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,440
so everyone is informed and up to date

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
on the latest changes that have been

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
done

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,760
to the design that you're working on

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
it's also important to remember to say

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
thank you for the feedback that we

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
receive

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,279
since people are giving you feedback

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,200
they're taking time to look at the

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,839
design work that you've done and

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,519
contribute and help to make it better so

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,079
make sure you show your appreciation

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,000
to the different community members or

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,240
folks who are taking time to

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,200
share feedback with you

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,680
this is um just kind of this applies to

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,800
any stage of the design process but

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,959
i think taking a more open approach to

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560
the process of getting feedback is

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,640
extremely helpful because

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
it's an extremely collaborative point of

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,720
the design process

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,200
and the design process is all about idea

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,120
generation and pushing an idea of word

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,399
so i think the more perspectives and

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,760
ideas that are presented

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,519
the better

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,800
when it comes to this step in the design

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,320
process it's all about rinsing and

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,639
repeating so

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
repeat the design and feedback cycle as

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,800
much as necessary

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,800
until you reach a final solution

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,480
another important part of an open source

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,399
design process is opening up the

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,320
contribution process it's not just about

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,320
the design process itself

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,720
so similar to setting up code

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,240
contribution guidelines

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
setting up design contribution

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,760
guidelines is a good practice to follow

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,480
if you want to open up the design

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,839
process to the larger community

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,760
the design process should be open and

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,000
available to anyone regardless of their

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,680
skill or experience level

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
if you can it's always good to call out

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,519
first time issues so newcomers have a

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
smoother start to their contribution

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,839
journey

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
it could be something as small as like

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,440
maybe updating like a formatting thing

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,120
or um designing an icon if that person

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
is more of a visual designer

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
i think any small bit that contributes

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
to the process

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
it's a great way to get involved with

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
the community

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,839
so here at red hat um patternfly is the

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,240
open source design system that we use

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,160
it features a really great set of design

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
contribution guidelines so

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,800
if you're looking to learn more about

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,720
how you contribute to a design

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,639
an online or an open source design

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,639
process i think it's really a great

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,760
starting point to learn more about

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,560
um an open contribution process when it

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
comes to

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,959
the sort of design contributions you can

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,440
make as a contributor to patterfly

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,200
you can contribute new features and

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,240
enhancement to an existing design

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
pattern

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,279
or create design guidelines

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,199
and also contribute documentation or

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,279
content support or research any of that

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,399
is included within that open design

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,399
contribution process

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,240
so the rough life cycle of a pattern fly

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
design contribution kind of goes like

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,120
this

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,480
so first uh an issue is created

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,720
um and from the pattern fly github

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,800
you can access um that issue whether

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,560
it's created by another community member

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
someone on like the core pattern fly

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,360
team and

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,199
that issue might be for a new feature or

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,880
a comment on an existing issue that

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,000
needs an enhancement

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,160
so from that issue um you would create a

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,199
design proposal that includes wireframes

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,199
and mock-ups

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
that explain the intent and the behavior

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,959
of the design

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320
and then once you've kind of maybe gone

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,959
through a couple

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,839
uh rough feedback cycles then you can

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,519
submit your

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,600
design to the pattern five team in the

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
community and they will give you

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,279
feedback and help you to finish up that

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,399
design contribution so then

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,279
it can be um absorbed into the full

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,279
pattern fly system

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,320
so the next stage we'll cover and this

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
is kind of the last couple steps of the

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,600
design process

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
is prototyping and testing

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,800
at this stage in the design process your

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,720
goal is to start to prototype and test

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,639
out a final solution

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,839
iteration and feedback are still major

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
parts of the stage

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,959
to open sourcify on the step of

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,440
prototyping and testing

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,880
you could create a html and css

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,120
prototype and share out

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,720
the prototype with the community so they

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
could kind of do some quick prototype

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
testing

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,720
personally i use tools like marvel or

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,560
envision to do prototyping

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,079
but i like to share those prototype

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,199
links out with the community so that

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,000
they can freely

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,000
and openly access those prototypes and

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,240
take them for a test drive

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,079
similar to sharing out design work i

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,519
think sharing out the prototype is more

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,639
important than the tools that you're

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,639
actually using to build it

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,399
similar to the design stage in the

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,639
design process

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,160
during the prototyping stage feedback is

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,959
still a crucial part

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,839
of going through this part of the design

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,519
process

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,519
and still something that you should take

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,320
into consideration at this point in the

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,320
design process

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,720
when it comes to testing out a prototype

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,040
i think it's important to

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,880
get a variety of different users and try

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,240
to get users who are not involved in the

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,199
initial design process

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,079
earlier on to test out the prototype so

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,720
you try and get less bias feedback

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
so once you've kind of ran through a

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
couple

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,800
different tests of testing out the

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,560
prototype

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,920
you should try to share out the results

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,000
with the community that you got from

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,759
that round of testing

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
i think it's also important to

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,680
communicate any drastic design decisions

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,480
that were made at this stage

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,959
or openly express like what changes were

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,639
made

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:55,600
or just kind of give the community and

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
the open just to increase the openness

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,279
just kind of explain your

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
uh your reasoning and give an

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
explanation

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
of why some decisions were made and why

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,240
some designs happened

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,240
or were refined in a way that they were

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,520
with any sort of design process you

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,520
follow there are some pros and cons

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,439
some pros of an open source design

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,280
process include

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,880
i think you can really involve way more

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,520
folks in the design process when you're

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
using

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,799
open methodologies you can pull from a

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,319
wider set

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,320
to come up or a wider set of

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,240
perspectives to come up with more

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,080
innovative solutions

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,760
you can get users involved in the design

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,600
process earlier on

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,320
and it also makes the design process

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,320
more accessible

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,080
some cons of an open source design

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,400
process include

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,000
the process can feel a little bit less

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,480
straightforward and chaotic since it

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,039
doesn't

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,880
involve more people at times it can kind

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,840
of feel like there are too many cooks in

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
the kitchen

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,559
and it can be kind of hard to um maybe

00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,919
filter feedback since you

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,720
you're getting kind of inundated with

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,960
feedback at times and then

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
the last con in my opinion is the

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
lattice voice is not always the most

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
right or informed voice

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
um since again you are working with a

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,320
really large party of people

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,679
so you can obviously appease all of them

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,120
but you have to try and come up with the

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,679
best solution to the problem that you're

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,679
solving for

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,280
so in conclusion um these are just a

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,840
couple points that i hope you all can

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,840
um remember and take away from this talk

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,000
when it comes to open source it

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,880
shouldn't just refer to code

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,919
it refers to design as well i think it's

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
really important to

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,160
connect and collaborate with the

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,720
community as soon as possible

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
keeping communication and feedback loops

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
open

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,720
is an essential part of an open source

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
design process

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
also being transparent with your

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,720
decision making

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,240
when it comes to the tools that you use

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,640
it's not really

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,320
that's not really a huge importance i

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
think sharing out the design work is the

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,720
most important part

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,720
and then opening up the design process

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,240
to community contributions

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,400
since opening up the contribution

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,320
process is a really big uh

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,600
hallmark of an open source design

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,559
process and open source

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,520
development process more perspectives

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
are better than just

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,000
one when it comes to giving and

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,880
receiving feedback

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,559
listen and take note and say thank you

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,559
and then iterate iterate iterate

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,280
thank you i

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
also included a couple of resources at

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,600
the end of this slide so

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,440
if anyone is interested in learning more

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,360
about open source contribution

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,320
guidelines the pattern fly

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,960
link is there i also link to

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,799
inkscape and blender just as kind of

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,240
open source design tools that people can

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,400
use and

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,400
learn and kind of get comfortable with

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,880
i'm gonna stop sharing and open up the

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,720
chat to see if anyone has any questions

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,640
that was an amazing talk laura thank you

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,640
so much

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
audience please feel free to pop your

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,320
questions in the chat

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,280
since we have a good amount of time

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,600
remaining i guess before our next talk

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,559
um feel free to start a conversation

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,559
while laura is here

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,360
yeah it's looking kind of quiet probably

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
um everybody has

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,520
grasped pretty much of what you said

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,840
then

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
um if anybody in the audience wants to

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,880
share

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,000
take this time to share any of their

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,640
views

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,799
around open sourcing their design

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,240
process or any other topic relate

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:51,760
related to ux design please

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,400
feel free to let me know yeah anyone has

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
like

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,240
any best practices or suggestions for

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,919
anyone else in the

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,480
in on the call feel free to share

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,840
and if not i just put out a link to the

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,000
breakout room

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,360
if you want to hang out there after this

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,400
talk or
