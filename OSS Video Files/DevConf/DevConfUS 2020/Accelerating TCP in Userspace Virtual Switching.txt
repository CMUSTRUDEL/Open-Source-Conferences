	Speaker: Flavio Leitner

Open vSwitch (OVS) is the most common virtual switch. It is known to provide the most significant performance improvement handling medium-to-small network packets when accelerated with DPDK, if compared with Linux network stack.

However, networks nowadays have to deal with all sorts of packet sizes and this was the motivation to implement TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) support in OVS-DPDK.

This talk will explain the feature's current status, implementation, performance comparisons, and future plans.
