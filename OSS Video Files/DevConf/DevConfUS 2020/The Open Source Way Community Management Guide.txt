Publication date: 2020-10-06

Description: 
	Speaker: Karsten Wade

Contributors to open source projects learn and create methods and practices for having a good community experience. Open source practitioners share these methods with each other all the time, and The Open Source Way brings those best practices together, written as a collaborative community effort. We are updating this guide; you are invited to learn about, participate in, and contribute to The Open Source Way and the community of practice around it.

In addition to bringing a slightly-opinionated view of how & what makes a successful project, this guide includes the often missing reasons -- why do certain practices work, and why have others been tried and abandoned.

This talk introduces the 2.0 version of the guide itself, what is covered within it, and highlight the narrative being told from/to community management practitioners. You'll learn how to consume and/or contribute to this guide and the body of community knowledge around it.
