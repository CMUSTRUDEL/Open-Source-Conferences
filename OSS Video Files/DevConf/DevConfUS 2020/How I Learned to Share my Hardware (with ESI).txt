Title: How I Learned to Share my Hardware (with ESI)
Publication date: 2020-10-07

Description: 
	Speaker: Tzu-Mainn Chen

The Elastic Secure Infrastructure (ESI) project was started by the Mass Open Cloud (MOC) in order to "create a set of services/systems to permit multiple tenants to flexibly allocate bare-metal machines from a pool of available hardware, create networks, attach bare-metal nodes and networks, and to optionally provision an operating system on those systems through the use of an associated provisioning service". As part of this project, ESI has contributed upstream development efforts in Ironic to custom development of a leasing service and has created a CLI to create a bridge in between OpenStack and additional functionality needed by ESI. On this presentation, we will discuss both the challenges and the successes behind these efforts. We will also demonstrate how we're putting all this work together into a flexible hardware sharing architecture - designed specifically for the MOC, but easily adaptable for other needs as well!
