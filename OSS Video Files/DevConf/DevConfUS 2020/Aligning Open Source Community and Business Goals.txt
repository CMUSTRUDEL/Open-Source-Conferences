	Speaker: Brian Proffitt

As open source continues to eat the software world, many organizations want to take advantage of the innovation and flexibility afforded by open source for their own business practices. But, as many businesses learned, just throwing developers into an open source project and hoping for the best wasnâ€™t good enough. Organizations must proactively establish, maintain, and ultimately nurture communities around their open source projects and ensure those communities are still aligned with the business' goals. A successful method Red Hat's Open Source Program Office (OSPO) uses to accomplish this is an audit for communities, which identify the key areas where open source communities need assistance, and also help OSPO manage its time and resources more effectively by assigning the right people to do the most impactful and business-positive tasks. In this presentation, Brian Proffitt will review the audit process, its results to date, and how business and community goals maintained alignment.
