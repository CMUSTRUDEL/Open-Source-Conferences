Title: Aligning Open Source Community and Business Goals
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Brian Proffitt

As open source continues to eat the software world, many organizations want to take advantage of the innovation and flexibility afforded by open source for their own business practices. But, as many businesses learned, just throwing developers into an open source project and hoping for the best wasnâ€™t good enough. Organizations must proactively establish, maintain, and ultimately nurture communities around their open source projects and ensure those communities are still aligned with the business' goals. A successful method Red Hat's Open Source Program Office (OSPO) uses to accomplish this is an audit for communities, which identify the key areas where open source communities need assistance, and also help OSPO manage its time and resources more effectively by assigning the right people to do the most impactful and business-positive tasks. In this presentation, Brian Proffitt will review the audit process, its results to date, and how business and community goals maintained alignment.

we will be kicking off brian's talk on

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,960
aligning open source community and

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,480
business goals in two minutes

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,320
so hopefully everyone's on the edge of

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
their seats and ready to listen

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,480
i hope everyone listening here has

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,199
gotten as much out of devconfus as i

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
have

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,400
over the last couple days it's been an

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,320
excellent event

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,600
and probably the best virtual conference

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,279
that i've been part of so i've

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
very much enjoyed it it's definitely not

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,599
the first either

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,519
good day my name is brian profit manager

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,120
with the open source program office and

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,800
i'm pleased to have you viewing this

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,520
session of dev confus

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,600
2020 where we'll be talking about the

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,160
alignment of community project

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
and business goals and how we bridge

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,000
that gap

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
to make those goals aligned this is

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,239
something that we do a lot in the open

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,520
source program office

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,960
where we get we help upstream

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
projects that red hat stewards

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
you know figure out how to get their

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,559
goals to align with

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,960
the business needs of red hat as a whole

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,040
this is something that's pretty common

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,760
within any kind of open source project

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,320
that's

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
interfacing with a corporate environment

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,360
we certainly

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,000
see this on a daily basis but it's also

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,000
a difficult task because as you might

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,360
expect

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
the alignment of community goal and a

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,960
business goal

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
which is mostly going to be for profit

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
um

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,759
on the surface it doesn't sound like

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,560
it's going to actually

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,119
you know fly very well but in in reality

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
it kind of does

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,439
you just have to take the time to work

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,560
it out and get those goals set and

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,320
aligned

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,640
now setting goals is not something

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,680
that's super fun

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,640
but it does need to be done and

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,079
you if you do it in a realistic way

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
you'll find that

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,119
setting goals isn't that arduous of a

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
task

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,960
and that those goals can be you know

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,720
realistically created

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,479
and probably met 2020 notwithstanding

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,319
so let's start on the business side of

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,599
things and we're just going to talk

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,160
about what businesses

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,840
do what they're all about and you know

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,400
if you've been to business school

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
sorry we're breaking this down for you

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
in just a few minutes so

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,239
sorry you put in all that money but this

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
is what what it's going to be about at

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,440
least from the perspective of this

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,280
presentation today

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,879
so businesses are all about creating

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
goods or services

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
and they optimize the marketplace for

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,200
receptiveness to

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,720
buy those goods and services so

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,560
euphemistically what we call

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,120
marketing and then they distribute those

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,440
goods and services

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,599
and then finally hopefully they generate

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,200
a profit from the sale of those goods

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,760
and services

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,120
and repeat so there you go all your

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,519
business school knowledge in

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,239
one easy to follow slide but beyond that

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
you know that seems pretty

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,159
straightforward

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,159
and we're not going to break new ground

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
here talking about what a business might

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,080
be doing

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,840
but we do need to understand what a

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
community's needs are

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,920
and how they might align because when

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
you first think about a community

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
you're going to be thinking about wow

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
they're just about creating things in

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,840
free flow and it's very organic

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
and and how would that ever mesh with

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,599
the rigorous uh

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
demands of like you know for-profit

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,239
business and a capitalist framework

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
well let's give it a c and find out if

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,599
that's certainly the case

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,799
so in a community you're also creating

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,840
goods

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,200
it may be software it may be hardware it

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,799
may be documentation

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,319
it could be a lots of different things

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,879
there are many open source

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
projects out there now for this

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,519
presentation

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,200
you may find me slipping into the lazy

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,680
person's way of saying it and just

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,680
saying we're talking about software

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,319
expand that a little bit when you hear

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,280
me say software specifically because

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,560
99 times out of 100 i'm going to be

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,920
talking about

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
software hardware content everything

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,199
else

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
around that can be done in an open

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
source way

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
but let's back to this we're going to be

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,080
talking about okay communities they're

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,400
going to be

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,400
creating goods whatever those goods

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
might be

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,040
they're going to the project's going to

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,320
try to optimize the user and developer

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,320
audience

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,720
to be receptive to those goods so

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,000
it may not be formal marketing although

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,560
certainly some larger

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
open source projects do do formal

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
marketing

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,120
but it's marketing-ish in the sense that

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,160
we're talking about you know giving the

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
users and the

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,520
developers an idea of what the project

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,639
is making why it's making it and what

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,160
good is the thing that's being made

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,160
will be for the end consumer

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
or you know developers who might want to

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,199
contribute to the project

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,520
so again possibly not formal marketing

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,280
but

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,199
certainly in marketing-ish um in the way

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,039
that the community gets the word out

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,479
they will distribute those finished

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,680
goods um

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,759
with the source of the

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
whatever is being created so software

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,520
it's going to be source code if it's

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,400
hardware it's going to be the specs

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,240
and so forth and so on and those will be

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,600
distributed however away

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,000
the license dictates um those

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
uh the source is distributed with those

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
goods

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
they're going to generate users and

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,800
contributions and

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,360
more use um so they're looking for

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,600
you know getting you know the project

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,759
more and more used and then ideally more

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
and more contributions to the project

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,160
so this is where it varies a little bit

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,680
from the actual sale because

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,280
you know after you you sell something in

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
a commercial sense you're

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,199
not really looking for contributions

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,039
you're really just looking for

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,199
users and or you know currency

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,080
in this case you're looking for users

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
and

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,199
ideally more people can contribute to

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
your project

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,080
so it grows in a healthy and sustainable

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,479
way

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,720
and then of course you repeat all this

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,479
um you repeat this with new iterations

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
of whatever you're creating

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,319
or if you're very successful you will

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,759
have some projects that will build off

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,120
the main project

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
and off you go to just start it all over

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,400
again

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
so as you can see if you look at

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,240
businesses and communities in this way

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,759
and what they're doing and what they're

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,479
trying to accomplish

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
there are a lot of differences in their

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
end goals

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,520
they're still both trying to make

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
something they're still both trying to

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
get

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
as many people to use it as possible

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,120
it's just that you know a business is

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,360
going to be looking for

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,720
some kind of you know transactional

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
exchange

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,360
and a community is going to be looking

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,840
for more of a collaborative exchange

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,000
where you can have

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,560
ideas and and new input coming in

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,479
in the form of contributions and

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,280
certainly let's face it it's not

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,759
you know it's not for nothing if your

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,319
project is successful and you have

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,280
a zillion downloads a month that is not

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
the

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,639
big marker for a healthy community but

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,680
you know

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,440
it's nice to be like and and certainly a

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,599
community is going to be part of that as

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,599
well

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,879
so when we talk about the alignment of

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
business goals

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,800
and community goals it's really

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
important that we understand the concept

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,199
of

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
open first and this is something that

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,240
anyone who works for red hat

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
will certainly understand and anybody

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
who's familiar with

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
you know how red hat and other open

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
source companies work

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,879
will feel that this is a very familiar

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,080
topic but it is not

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,120
a universally applied topic

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,160
with organizations who do use open

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
source

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,879
so we want to go kind of through it real

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
quick and emphasize that this is the

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,759
framework in which all of this is coming

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,639
from open first is when the core values

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,680
of the business

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,599
are aligned with the community

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,120
and it's very important that we do the

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,599
wording in that order

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,560
because it is not the other way around

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,839
the community

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,479
should not be aligning itself with the

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,480
needs of the business

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,519
and and that's really key to understand

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
because in a lot of situations a

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,959
business will

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,480
start a community and want to make sure

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,800
that the community is

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
always in lockstep with the business

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,560
goals

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,399
that is not the way to a sustainable and

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,040
healthy community

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,360
it is the way certainly to building a

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,600
software or hardware project that

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,399
the business really likes and the

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,519
business can

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,959
sell in you know in a way that's better

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
for the business

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,360
but the community itself will suffer

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,839
very quickly because if you just have

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
people

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,240
in the business who are dictating um

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
the way that project is going to go no

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
one from outside of the business is

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,760
going to

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,120
really feel you know empowered or

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,080
incentivized to

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
jump in and contribute so therefore you

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,320
have

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,120
what is known as a you know universally

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
stagnant

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
community in terms of diversity of

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
organizations

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,440
that are involved in it and that's

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,920
really something that's not good to see

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,519
so it's important to remember that the

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,120
community values

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,440
should go first so when you're

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,360
developing in a community

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
everything starts in the community if

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
you build documentation

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,640
everything should start in the community

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,760
and so forth and so on

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,600
for every aspect of that

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,920
it has to start in the community first

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
now it is important to clarify we'll

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,079
touch on this a little bit later

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,279
that we're not saying that the community

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,360
should completely ignore

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,200
the needs of the business or businesses

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
plural that might be involved in the

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,680
project they

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,480
they should be willing to compromise and

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
and

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,079
you know make allowances for each other

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,800
but

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
it's but the priority should always be

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,360
with the community

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,880
and that's what we're trying to get out

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,760
here in this presentation today

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
in the open source way there are five

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,079
key elements

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,600
of that philosophy that should

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,320
show up when we're talking about

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,560
how a business should be operating

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,040
within an open source framework

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
so it definitely should have

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,600
transparency where

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,519
everybody involved in the project should

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
have access to the information and the

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,760
materials necessary

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,760
to do the best work they could possibly

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,880
do

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,120
collaboration if everybody is free to

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,279
participate and collaborate and you

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,360
don't have this massive hierarchy of you

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
know only certain people can put in new

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
ideas

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,320
you're going to have a much healthier

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,839
community

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
in terms of open source project

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,120
management

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,079
the old one and the good one the release

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,640
early and re

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,000
release often uh mantra that is

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,519
certainly very

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,079
uh healthy for an open source community

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,399
to do

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,519
the more that you release the faster you

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,680
can find

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,720
um new discoveries and possibly old bugs

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,240
that will show up so it's good to have

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,440
that going for any

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,079
uh open source community so and and

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
for the second part of that too it is

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,399
also

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,399
key because it just keeps people

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,279
interested if you wait

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,639
years uh to release the next version of

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,519
the software

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
i guarantee you the human attention span

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,800
will

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,720
get people leaving your project and

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
going off and finding the new shiny

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
thing

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,279
so there's a there's a more of a sneaky

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
way

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,440
about release early release often beyond

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
the

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,800
philanthropic idealism of making sure

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,000
that everybody can collaborate as much

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
as possible

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
so either way you cut it release early

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,839
and release often is a key part of the

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,360
open source way

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,399
meritocracy i touched on this a little

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,320
bit when we were talking about

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,800
collaboration but certainly

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,880
any healthy community is going to have

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,320
good

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,720
meritocracy where it doesn't matter

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,079
where the idea comes from

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,959
it it matters what is the best idea

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,720
and where that you know and how that

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,360
idea can be applied

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,680
um good governance is important to

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
keeping a good meritocracy in place

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,920
because

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,680
governments that allows um you know a

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
clear and accurate decision-making

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,920
process

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
if there are conflicting ideas being

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,680
brought to the table

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,880
and how those conflicting ideas are

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
resolved

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,680
that is a key part of keeping you know

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
a community healthy and also keeping

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,519
meritocracy

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,639
um straight you don't see favoritism

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
creeping in

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,680
if you have good governance and then

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,440
finally the community itself

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,279
when the community is given a common

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
purpose and when it is given common

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,959
goals

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,800
um and they can take their goals and you

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,839
know build on them and

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,680
work with their shared values to guide

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,480
their decision making

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
that will also be the mark of a really

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
healthy community

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,519
so those are the five things that you

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
know really

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,680
are key to the open source way and

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
certainly a big part of what it means to

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,399
be open

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,959
first okay so we've done the high level

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,720
theory

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,160
we've talked about how we're going to be

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
you know doing

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,079
uh everything in the open and this is

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,839
great because we

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,360
i'm sure a lot of us have seen this

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,959
before but how do we

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,519
tactically apply this grand strategy

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,480
well in the red hat open source program

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,240
office we have

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,800
two different tools that we use to help

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
figure out how healthy a community is

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,199
and then

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,000
also how that community can be aligned

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,920
with

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,480
the goals of red hat now you can apply

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,279
you can use these methodologies in one

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
way or another

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,199
in your own organization if you so

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
choose

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,800
but here's what red hat is going to be

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,600
doing and has been doing for

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,440
at least a few years now the first tool

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,639
that we have are called audits

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,760
and audits examine community projects on

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,639
a regular basis

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,360
usually annually from an outsider's

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,760
point of view

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,959
in order to determine how that community

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,519
is perceived

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,000
and how they can be joined by enter any

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,560
interested contributor or user

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,680
now that's a big long fancy way of

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
basically saying

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,040
we looked at a community as if we were

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
coming in from the

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,199
outside and how easy is it to join the

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,839
community

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
how hard is it to get involved with the

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,920
community and

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,040
from there we build um statistics and

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,320
dashboards

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,480
to sort of quantifiably indicate the

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,800
the community's health because if you

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,759
have a community that is very difficult

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,560
to be involved

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,920
in that is not really a good thing it's

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,600
certainly not going to be healthy for

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,399
the community and it's certainly not

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
going to

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
you know get you access to new

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,199
contributions

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,360
and new ideas remember ideas and

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,839
contributions are the currency here in

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,639
the community environment

00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:00,160
not necessarily you know

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,560
actual paper currency so audits are the

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,800
one tool that we use the second tool

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,600
we use that are very related to audits

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,639
are called stakeholder reviews

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,440
again these are also regular

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,240
probably annual examinations although in

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
some cases

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,600
they are done more often than annually

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,320
from the businesses point of view

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,959
not an outsider's point of view these

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,759
stakeholder reports also determine the

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,040
efficiency and the health of the project

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,839
and it also helps figure out how

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,279
the project is aligned with the business

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,600
goals

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,360
so they will go in determine the health

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,720
the project determine the project

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,440
schools which are

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,639
again the priority here and then they

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,440
will work to see if

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
how they can match the business goals to

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,440
you know

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,320
match those of the project goals and so

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
we have audits and stakeholder reviews

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
they

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,920
sound similar in many ways they're they

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,839
are similar we use that to our advantage

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
but we'll talk about audits first

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,640
so an audit is going to be examining

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
several different elements of the

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,679
community to kind of ensure

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,240
that you know things are going to be set

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,319
up well

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,079
for onboarding which is the process of

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,799
getting new community members in

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,520
that is not the only aspect that we talk

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,360
about

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,880
with an audit but that is certainly the

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,120
emphasis on audit

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,400
because how an outsider perceives a

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,520
community is a

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,640
really good indicator of what things the

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,320
community should be

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,919
fixing to get things to work better

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,240
so the first thing are going to be you

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
know the easy things the public facing

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,559
access

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,280
assets rather sorry the websites

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,400
the mailing list the chat channels

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,160
whether it's irc

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
or slack anything that you use to

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,200
communicate that the community sees

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,480
first we euphemistically call that

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,280
infrastructure

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,960
that is probably not the right way to

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,440
use that word but that's the

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
the name that we've kind of assigned to

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
it

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,360
we look at these assets to see how well

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
they're designed

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,280
how clear they are how well-worded they

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
are

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,600
it may come as a shock but there's still

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
many free and open source projects out

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,080
there

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,400
that don't really have a clear website

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,440
and something as basic as what is the

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,840
project

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,559
about what does it do and how do i get

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,000
it

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,720
um there are complicated and convoluted

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,559
websites

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,919
all over the place in the open source

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,080
ecosystem

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,440
and they really need to get you know

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,440
themselves fixed

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,559
so this is something we try really hard

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,840
to avoid

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,799
in the red hat ecosystem release

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,960
management

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,320
how often does a project come out when

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
it comes out

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,000
you know how is it announced is it clear

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
is it

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,960
done on a regular cadence again these

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,120
are all markers of a healthy community

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,200
documentation this is another key

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,559
element of onboarding

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,960
in a community where you said

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,360
what the project is you may have clearly

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,760
said how to get the project

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,160
but if you don't explain how to use the

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,760
project or what the project is good for

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,559
in what use cases again you've created a

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
barrier

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,039
so documentation is always going to be a

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,840
key part of a healthy community

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,960
contributions now we'll talk about this

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,720
a little bit later

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
this is actually the one part of the

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,840
audit that we might not be looking at

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,320
from purely an outsider's point of view

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,360
in that most outsiders when they first

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,280
look at a project

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
are not going to be looking at the

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,600
contribution levels

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,520
of a given project to see if it's

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,000
healthy or not

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,039
they should but most of us are not going

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,039
to be doing that

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,440
so this is the one part of it that we

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,039
might be getting a little more insider

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,799
baseball with

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,880
we'll talk about that a little bit later

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,159
but certainly contributions to a project

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
whether they are increasing or

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,039
decreasing

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,440
and what part of the life cycle that

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,200
project is in is certainly a

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,440
element of a healthy project outreach

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,559
what is the project doing to let itself

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,640
be heard

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,159
are there blogs do they have an active

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,919
social media account

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,000
do are they present in a lot of events

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,720
do they host their own events whether

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,720
they're online virtual meetups that we

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,000
do now in the time of covet

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,120
or were they doing regular meetups at

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,120
local organizations around the world

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,880
prior to covid these are all things that

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,559
we look at when we're looking at an

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,080
audit

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,320
the license this is probably by far

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,600
the least worrisome part of an audit

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,840
audit because

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,880
all the projects that red hat works with

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,919
have some kind of

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,000
osi approved open source license

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,240
but if we are looking at a project that

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,520
you know we're not directly stewarding

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,480
certainly we're going to be looking at

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,760
the license to make sure that it's got

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,039
an actual open source license and is

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,039
applying it correctly

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,240
so let's look at each one of those

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
quickly

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,320
infrastructure and again we're talking

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,600
about website

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:29,039
communications channels how easy

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,760
is it to access the product so how

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,440
how easy is it to download the software

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,840
then how easy is it to

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
actually find the documentation you can

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,159
have documentation

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,280
but if you don't actually you know put

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,320
it in

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,280
and make it easy to access it's going to

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,600
be difficult

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,840
to use um release management

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
what kind of releases are coming out is

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,080
it done

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,760
va is it done va

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,400
you know rpms or some kind of

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,919
source turbo you know how is it released

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,640
because that can make it easier or

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,960
harder to

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,400
implement um how are the release

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,640
announcements done

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
are there qa processes built into the

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,480
system are there

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,159
you know continuous integration and

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,720
continuous deployment process

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,720
built into the release management this

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,240
is not always a given it seems like this

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,840
is fairly straightforward but

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,919
there are a lot of projects that don't

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,000
have all these elements in place and

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,360
they probably should

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,039
documentation when you talk about it is

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,679
there a quick start guide

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,320
that's an easy to use how do i get this

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,320
thing going and how do i start using a

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,880
guide that is something that's missing

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,360
from a lot of projects

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
is there a change log are there use

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480
cases

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,559
some projects are complicated and not

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,679
always easy to understand why you would

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,320
use them so

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
talking about how another user

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,559
implements something

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,600
in a use case can be very helpful is

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,640
there a guide to

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,720
you know installing it from source

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,720
usually that's buried somewhere and it

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
didn't have repository

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,880
that's fine but maybe make sure it's

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,280
highlighted somewhere and say hey

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,159
if you want to you know run this from

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,559
source

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,200
here's where to go to find that piece of

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,760
information

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,520
contributions again this is the one

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,080
where we kind of kick the ant hill a

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,799
little bit

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,120
and see what's going on inside we're

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,080
deviating from the insider's perspective

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,159
a little bit

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,520
because we do see the level of

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,799
contributions

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,120
and how fast issues are closed and

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,240
and how you know contributions are

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,960
growing

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
we we see a lot of this as a marker of

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,360
health

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,520
now anybody can actually

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,640
take the time and find this so we're not

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,640
deviating too

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,039
far from the insider's perspective but

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,039
we also recognize that most people are

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,960
not going to be doing this

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,559
and we are looking at things like pull

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,880
request contributors and issue

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,679
contributors and contributions itself

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,840
and

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,240
how many contributors are coming from a

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,640
certain organization

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,400
the average time to close an issue the

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,480
average time

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,000
to first attention that an issue gets

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
these are things that we are going to be

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,240
looking at

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,240
and making part of the audit

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,279
outreach as i said earlier we're talking

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,559
about blogs we're talking about social

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,039
media we're talking about

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,320
events whether in real life or virtual

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,520
we're talking about meetups not

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,640
every project has to have a blog

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,240
if you for instance if you're very small

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,320
and you just have a few contributors

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,840
working on your project then no you're

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
probably not going to want to take a lot

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,600
of time

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,600
to you know generate vlog content you're

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,000
busy working on the project

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,760
um but you might want to try to set up

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
some kind of social media account

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,320
whether it's

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,760
something on instagram or twitter

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,760
you know something that you can kind of

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,679
get the news out quickly about what's

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
going on in your project and generate

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,080
interest

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,799
in it not only using it but then

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,840
contributing to it

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,840
the license itself you know most of the

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,039
time it's pretty straightforward there's

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,919
going to be got to be an

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,200
osi approved license we need to make

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,480
sure there aren't any income

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,919
incompatibilities within the project

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,760
that is rare

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,960
anymore but that does crop up

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,000
occasionally

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:34,240
is there good governance for the project

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,120
and also is there a privacy policy in

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,960
place

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,200
certainly things like the european

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,840
union's gdpr

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,360
policy makes it important that all

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,919
participants in a project

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,559
understand what their privacy options

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,480
are

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,960
when they're participating within that

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,240
project

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,200
okay so that's basically what an audit

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,039
is

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,320
i do these audits for the open source

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,440
program office

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,840
they don't take exceptionally long we

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,480
we use a spreadsheet we we sort of fill

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,600
these out

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,080
and most of the time it takes about

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,520
two or three hours to conduct an audit

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,039
the longest part of

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,720
doing the audit is writing up the

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,720
general report afterwards

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,320
because that will take probably another

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,559
hour or two

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,960
just to kind of get that you know set up

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,200
and worded in the correct way

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,799
stakeholder reviews are very similar to

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
audits and in fact you're going to see a

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,320
lot of overlap between the two

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,559
and again as i it hinted earlier we

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,960
actually use that to our advantage

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,080
so what are we looking at with when we

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,960
talk about stakeholder

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
reviews well here we're looking at the

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,200
goals

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,600
of the project um and we're also looking

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,000
at the project health

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,039
and we're and we're also looking at the

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,960
goals of

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,880
the community and i sort of said that

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,240
backwards so the first goals we were

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,919
looking at would be

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,159
we're looking at what the business goals

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,520
are now we're looking at the project

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,520
health and then we're looking at the

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,200
community goals

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,559
and remember the community goals have

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,919
priority

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,840
so even though we're you know they're

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,799
listed last year that actually doesn't

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,480
mean anything

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,480
they are certainly the priority

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,480
so when we talk about goals we're

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,919
looking at the project schools

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,960
as documented by the business unit

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,600
um so what we mean there

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,720
is if a business unit within red hat or

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,520
any organization

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,320
is working intimately with that project

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,240
we want to know

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,240
what that business unit's goals are for

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,760
the project

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
we're also going to be looking at the

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,480
organization's goals

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,840
um from the company itself so what does

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,320
the company want to be doing

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,600
inside this software um usually that's

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
going to overlap with the actual

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,240
business unit that's interfacing with

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,399
the project but

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,480
there might be some deviation so we're

00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,679
going to be looking at what those goals

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,120
are

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,880
project health well most of the time

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
this is basically what we're covering in

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
an audit

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,320
and so we're you know there are a few

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,240
deviations like

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,640
a stakeholder review is still looking at

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,840
things like the target audience and

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,480
um and and also how

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,039
you know the general ecosystem is so

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,559
white like

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,640
what other projects are out there that

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,039
are doing about the same thing

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,399
but other than that a lot of things are

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,279
going to be looking

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,039
a lot like what we do in a community

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,080
audit

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,840
so nothing really new there and then

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,600
finally we look at the community goals

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,559
so we can orient the direction of the

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,240
project and

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,559
you know from there we're looking at

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,080
what the project goals are from

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,559
the business unit the overall

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,559
organization we're taking the health

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,880
we're rolling in all that and then we're

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,080
also talking to other members within the

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
community

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,559
this is very very important if we

00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,600
especially if we're working in a project

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,720
that actually has

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,320
multiple organizations working for it we

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,480
are going to be talking

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,399
with all those different uh players

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,240
within the community to figure out what

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,960
their goals are for the project

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,000
and we're going to work with them to

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,720
make sure

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,960
that our goals align our goals align

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,039
with those of the project itself

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,559
we're also going to be looking at any

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,039
kind of metrics that might

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,159
you know help us determine the project

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,159
health

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,679
any dependencies that the projects work

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,960
on that need to be

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,720
addressed and identify any challenges

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,480
moving forward whether it's the next

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,520
quarter or the next year

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,440
those are things that are going to be

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,720
coming out of the community goals part

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,720
of the stakeholder review

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,840
how we do it at red hat specifically

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,360
so remember how i've been saying that

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,760
you know there's a lot of overlap with

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,760
the

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,440
audits and the sticker holder reviews

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,600
especially in the terms of

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,360
project health well guess what we're

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,799
going to be doing the audits first so

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,080
typically

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,960
i work with the community architect that

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,840
is assigned to a given project and

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,600
determine

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,039
okay when when are you going to be

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,080
actually doing

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,760
your stakeholder reviews um and if they

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,840
are doing it annually then

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,320
it's basically a question of me setting

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,159
up a time to do their audit about

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,159
you know anywhere from two to three

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,679
weeks before

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,399
they actually do their stakeholder

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,840
review the goal there is very simple i

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,480
can basically give them

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,840
most of if not all of the project health

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
data that they were going to be

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,960
including

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,279
in their stakeholder review and if i do

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,520
it in a timely enough fashion

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,279
they don't have to do it over again so

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,320
we save a lot of work there

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:48,159
by merging uh that part

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,840
of the process together

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,399
um the audits will be you know basically

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,320
there is a spreadsheet where i will go

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,640
through and step by step

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,679
look for key elements of the of the

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,519
project that

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,080
are going to be in place so things like

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,159
is there a website um are there sub

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,240
domains for the website do those sub

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,279
domains have the same navigation

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,600
um a lot of times if you set up

00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,080
wiki.project.org

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,880
the wiki's navigation is going to be

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,760
possibly

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,080
not the same as the main website that's

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,880
a

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,159
unfortunate you know byproduct of using

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,679
a subdomain

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
and then you have to give that

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,000
information to the project people and

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,799
say hey

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,080
this might look confusing to newcomers

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,000
is that something you want to spend a

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,360
lot of time

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,200
those are the kind of questions that are

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,720
going to be asked on the audit

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,279
questionnaire

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,399
we also look at that contributor data we

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,919
use a tool called

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:51,360
cauldron this is an open source tool

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,960
that is fostered by baturgia

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,880
if you're not familiar with petergia

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,960
they're a company out of spain that does

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,960
a lot of work in community metrics

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,880
we take all of that and put that

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,279
together and then we generate

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,120
a a you know a multi-page report

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,799
that includes all of the information

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,440
that we gathered and

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,640
any suggestions that we might have for

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,679
the project

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,559
we then present that report to the

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,600
community leaders of the given project

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,240
with the option of you know telling them

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,960
that

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,519
you know they don't have to fix all this

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,760
we never

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,440
actually put you know researchers down

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,559
and saying oh this is something you have

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,480
to fix

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,159
we always give them the option to

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,360
decline or accept

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,120
any suggestions we might make we also as

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,480
part of our work within the open source

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,799
program office

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,760
give them the option to actually that we

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,320
will help them

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,200
so if they need a website you know tune

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,080
up

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,840
as one example we have the skill set and

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,960
the resources available

00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,080
to help them with that if they don't

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,799
um or they can take that information and

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,720
do it

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,399
themselves at a time that they deem

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,240
you know they can fit it into their

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,480
schedule so

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,440
either way you know audits are never

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,000
compulsory

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,840
they are never done negatively even if

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,919
we find things that are

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,519
you know really need improvement we

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,279
never approach people and say

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,720
oh you people are the biggest screw-ups

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,399
ever no

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,640
we're trying to be positive here and

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,840
trying to point out hey we see you need

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,360
some help here

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,440
we've got some people that are willing

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,600
to help you with that if you need it

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:39,840
and we're you know we work together to

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,840
try to make the community better

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,519
stakeholder reviews as i said those are

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,320
done next

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,679
um the data from the re-audit or the

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,519
data from the audits are

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,440
is reused um and that helps make the

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,600
stakeholder process go a lot

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,919
faster if somebody's already done the

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,039
leg work on the project health

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,720
um the business unit coordinates with

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,279
the community architect

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,159
um just get the goals and everything

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,040
else

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,639
identified and then they work together

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,280
and align those goals

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,679
and finally generate a final stakeholder

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,480
report

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,440
stakeholder reviews at red hat are sort

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,639
of treated like

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,720
annual reports for a business and they

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,879
are very important and they're key

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,919
to the operation of a project

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,919
that we work with

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,560
and with that that is how we put audits

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
and stakeholder reviews together

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,879
thank you very much for your attention

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,320
today we certainly do appreciate it

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,159
we look forward to getting your

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,839
questions and comments

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,839
um in the rest of the presentation

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,640
thank you very much brian that was a

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,720
very good presentation

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,040
and it's it's a complex subject how a

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,040
for-profit uh company deals

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,720
well with communities that are have very

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,800
different aims so it's very well done

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,839
and i appreciate that

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,520
great thank you very much so do we have

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,040
any questions for brian

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,119
we have a lot of people here watching so

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,240
we should have some

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,240
comments or anything like that

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,520
brian do you want would you like to add

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,119
something or do you like to make any

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,400
comments yourself

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,520
um you know not really i mean

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,400
i think that you know for us the process

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,119
uh continues to evolve we're always

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,560
looking for

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,200
suggestions and ways to improve

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,320
how we can you know more closely align

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,119
community

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,000
goals with business goals it's you know

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,280
it's never going to be a perfect system

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,800
it always varies from project to project

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,040
but it's certainly something that we are

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,839
continuing to look at so

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,200
beyond questions suggestions and

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,359
comments would also be welcome

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,760
uh do you have uh links or contact

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,640
information where you'd like to do that

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,119
um

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,680
sue let's see well one of the things i

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,079
noticed

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,240
during the presentation was i mentioned

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,960
this tool cauldron

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,560
which i did not put into i'll put it

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,079
into the chat

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,839
oh thank you brian and then we actually

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,920
have a question from jen krieger

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,920
who asks any advice on when open source

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,240
project goals do not align with business

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,240
goals

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,079
yeah so historically and this

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,760
this this has even happened a few times

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,760
historically at red hat

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,760
um so

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,040
you again giving a lot more weight to

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,640
the open source project versus the

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,880
business goals

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,560
but then there's also that immediacy of

00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,680
getting the business goal out you're

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,599
trying to satisfy

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:08,560
some customer need or some market need

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:11,359
so it really becomes a

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,400
really true collaboration and and both

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,000
sides are going to have to sit down

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,760
and try to figure out how to

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,280
you know how to get the project in the

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,000
direction that each one

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,119
wants to go this doesn't happen very

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,359
often because

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,640
usually unless it's a drastic

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,680
technology dependency change

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,640
most of the time the goals are going to

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,680
not be too disparate but the advice

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,359
would be

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,000
um to set up you know

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,560
teams that are going to be representing

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,440
all

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,119
you know anybody who's got a major stake

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,000
in the project

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,720
um with you know the business and have

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,640
them all

00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,400
just sort of sit there take no

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,160
technology action committee or something

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,400
like that to sort of figure out what the

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,440
roadmap for the project is going to be

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,119
it is really important that all players

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,079
um have a stake in in deciding how the

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,480
project

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,040
project is going to go and if the

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,560
business has a persuasive argument

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,480
then then that should do it

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,240
oh excellent well well thank you very

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,040
much brian uh so we have one more

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,119
question here

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,240
we have a question from uh carson wade

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,920
who asks

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,160
uh how do you see the evolution of

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,480
meritocracy as a core concept going

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,480
forward

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,880
if i understand the correct question

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,480
correctly um

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:47,280
i think that you know meritocracy

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,960
as as a thing seems to be kind of

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,000
evolving because in

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,200
in in the past meritocracy was

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,960
very much key to the individuals within

00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,520
a given project so a certain person

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,000
had you know awesome skills became a

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,760
maintainer became the lead maintainer

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,920
and and that's how it seems to have

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
happened now

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,640
um because a lot of us are working on

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,200
open source projects

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,520
full time we have that luxury and that's

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,359
a whole different conversation about

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,920
you know the privilege of being out

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,640
getting paid versus volunteering

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,839
um which is something we should all be

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,079
discussing too

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,640
but let's just say in the current

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,960
framework the way things are going

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,960
there's much more corporate environment

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,720
i don't see that

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
i've i've heard a lot of people talk

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,839
about how meritocracy

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,359
is getting dulled because of that

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,680
because now

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,720
you know some cynics would say now it's

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,520
becoming more of a

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:54,079
pay to play kind of um situation

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,520
i do agree that meritocracy at the

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,200
individual level has

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,960
been dulled slightly by

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,640
the the influx of corporate

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,319
participation

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,960
um but i i i think it's just been

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,880
dulled it's not being eliminated because

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,359
individuals at the end of the day

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,480
they're the ones responsible for getting

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,400
the code in they're

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,920
responsible for making sure the code

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,079
works and works

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,640
well and then somebody comes along and

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,599
makes it work better

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,319
so as long as it's people who are

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,359
actually

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,119
still doing the work no matter where

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,720
they're coming from

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:37,599
i think you know meritocracy um

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,440
is still going to be a prevalent uh

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,480
driver for projects moving forward

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,240
excellent excellent commentary um so

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,359
i'll ask a follow one based on that

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,560
is uh do you see meritocracy and

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,240
diversity is diverging as divergent

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,200
topics you know some people will bring

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,040
up and say

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,880
if you go exclusively on meritocracy

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,000
you're using one person's view of merits

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
or small groups

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,880
version of merits

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,119
i i'm gonna so i'm gonna ask a quick

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,880
clarification like when you're talking

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,400
about diversity you're talking about any

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,440
diversity are we talking about any

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,200
diversity yeah

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,640
yeah any different the broadest

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,760
sensitive term so

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,319
for me personally the more diverse a

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,680
project

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:27,119
is um the better off it is and

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,839
and that's i i strongly believe that

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,200
because

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,400
different cultures and different

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
um you know different gender outlooks

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,920
and different

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,319
you know different levels of ability you

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,160
know

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:45,839
and and and corporations and in in

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,760
that you're bringing in so much

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:53,760
more talent and perspectives

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:57,040
my my best conversations

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,680
come when i am talking to people that

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,480
think completely differently from me

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,119
because

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,760
i'm bringing what i bring to the table

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,480
you know

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,800
and you bring your stuff and you know

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,040
but

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,960
the more different we are the more the

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,079
more diverse the background

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,960
or history there is

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,480
the more you know you know it's

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,160
challenging but it's also

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,400
awesome because you just have this um

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,560
you know these new perspectives that you

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,440
just never would have seen before

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,000
i don't understand why this is so hard

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,280
to figure

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,640
out for me more diversity

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,520
i don't want to work with a bunch of

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,240
people who look and think like me

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,640
you know i want to work with people who

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,920
are going to bring more to the table

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,960
and and give us give the project

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,319
rather um better and

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,880
and more innovative ideas so

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,920
diversity really drives meritocracy then

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,720
so i believe

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,960
so i think i think it drives yeah it

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,480
drives creativity meritocracy

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,400
it drives so much interesting

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,599
now i tend to agree uh carson has an

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,599
interesting comment he says there's

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,040
historically a correlation between

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,720
people with merit and open source

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,079
project and the life privileges that

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,040
those folks have

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,680
yep and i would agree i would agree with

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,480
that

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,160
strongly and that is something that we

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,680
all need to work on both

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,680
you know certainly at an individual

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,720
level within projects definitely at the

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,160
corporate level

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,720
it is not easy um

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,720
and and but it's still something that we

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,000
have to try to do

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,920
because again i'm i'm coming at this

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,480
from two ways i'm coming at this like

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,680
i'm trying to be a better person

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,800
right but let's just say i'm not let's

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,920
just say i'm being very selfish and

00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,720
non-altruistic

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,880
from even that point of view even if i

00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,920
were being the most cynical person ever

00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,280
and i'm not but diversity

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,400
is an advantage and it's an advantage

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,680
for the project

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,400
so i do not understand

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,359
why this is so hard for people to figure

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,839
out

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,119
you know well i think it's about change

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,640
i think change is tough

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,079
i think that's really what it is is that

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,359
any sort of change if you're used to

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,480
seeing one thing if you're used to

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,480
working with a group

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,400
that's just like you even if there's a

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,119
major advantage to change

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,240
it is a hard thing to accept so that's

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,599
what it is and i think

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,400
pointing out the things you just said

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,839
about how it so drives creativity and

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,839
projects to have diversity

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,920
and to give the diversity of opinions

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,640
and things like that and the viewpoints

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,160
i think that's

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,319
one way to counteract that yes

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,520
well excellent excellent talk brian i

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,440
really enjoyed it

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,599
thank you and i think this conversation

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,079
is giving me an idea for my next stop

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,800
so we'll see what happens there

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,040
excellent

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,800
well and then that talk for for the uh

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,640
brian is giving me a great segue our

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
next talk starts in six minutes and

00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,760
brian will be remaining

as well as some of the other folks that

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,200
are in this room already so

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,040
please stay and we're gonna have a panel

source and process

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,359
