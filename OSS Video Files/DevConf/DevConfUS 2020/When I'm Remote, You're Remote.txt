In a world where the talent is everywhere, we need to be prepared to collaborate effectively with our co-workers wherever they may be. To be successful, we can’t simply open up remote seats on our teams and hope for the best; we need to become remote-first in everything we do from hiring and infrastructure choices to communication and collaboration. The way we interact with our co-workers needs to fundamentally change. This has become even more apparent across the globe in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We will be going over some of the practices I’ve adapted and experimented with that help me work better as an individual and with a remote team. All of this will be presented with some historical context on the subject and how misunderstandings of the modern office can make or break your chances of cultivating a strong remote-first environment.
