	Speaker: Ip Sam

Dapr is Microsoft's latest new open source project. Dapr is an event driven, portable distributed application runtime. It supports many programming languages and it is a natural fit for Kubernetes and OpenShift. Dapr provides consistency and portability via standard open APIs. Dapr's building blocks enable easy, event-driven, stateful, microservices development. Dapr handles state, resource bindings and pub/sub messaging, which enable event-driven, resilient architectures that scale. In this presentation, we will cover how engineering teams can leverage Dapr with OpenShift for the application development, writing high-performance, highly-scalable applications using OpenShift. We will start with a high level Dapr architecture overview. Then go through an example how to develop Dapr microservices, and look at the deployment process to get it up to OpenShift. We will use OpenShift to fine tune the performance.
