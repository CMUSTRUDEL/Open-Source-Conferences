Title: How to Handle a Usability PR Crisis
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Catherine Robson

As the impact of technology on society is gaining attention, user experience experts may find ourselves in situations where our work or impact on a product suddenly comes into question in the public eye. Where one day you are working behind the scenes to improve the companies user experience, the next day you may find yourself in the limelight as a user experience emergency evolves. This talk will cover how to handle a usability emergency and use it to catapult your user experience practice forward. It will cover practical steps including reframing, evaluating, planning, and communicating while the pressure is high. By the end of this talk, youâ€™ll know how to handle anything from a public PR crisis pointed at usability through that executive that tried your product and created an internal crisis to fix usability immediately.

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,759
a usability pr crisis i'm very excited

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,759
about this story

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,040
thank you beverly um hi everybody i'm

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,680
catherine robson

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,520

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,160
going to hope that works well

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
we're going to just do an entire screen

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,480
share

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,840
okay can we just confirm that we see the

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
slides

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
pepperley yes we can see you yeah okay

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,719
thank you

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,000
all right so today we're going to be

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,399
talking about how to handle a usability

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,320
pr crisis i i have oriented this talk

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:56,320
in a way that is speaking to

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,399
sort of a ux leader a ux designer

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,399
but i think it can apply to anybody

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
that's handling one of these situations

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,879
so if you just kind of take

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
a kind of ux person out of that and

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
think of it

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,439
from um a lead developer's perspective

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,840
or anybody else that

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,720
is trying to handle the situation i

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,720
think it can

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,720
apply well across the board

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,960
my name is catherine robson i am a user

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,119
experience design manager at red hat

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,600
i have over 15 years of experience in

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,640
user experience design i started

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
as a designer became a lead and have

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,360
managed teams for

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,159
quite a while now right now i'm managing

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,119
a team of 33 designers developers and

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,720
researchers

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,799
on developer experiences for red hat

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,399
so really enjoy that job in that

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,159
position and i've had the opportunity to

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,040
have a lot of great projects but i've

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,320
also had the opportunity to deal with

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,719
a type of pr crisis during my time and

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
so

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,439
we'll talk about that as part of this

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,439
discussion

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
all right so first of all what is a

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,319
usability pr crisis let's define

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
what this looks like there are many

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,000
different types

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,599
of crises that can happen i think

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,160
probably what most people

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,360
go to immediately is like the full

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,280
meltdown

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
which nobody wants to be in the full

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,280
meltdown emergency

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,599
pr crisis situation and you know one

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,000
that comes to mind is facebook privacy

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,360
um you know this obviously was very much

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,720
in the public eye

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
it was a huge pr crisis there was a lot

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,560
of attention on facebook

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,800
overall about how they were handling

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,959
this and how they needed to improve

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,720
uh users ability to control their own

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,120
data and their own privacy

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,239
so this is sort of a worst case scenario

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,080
of a pr crisis

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
and hopefully nobody ever has to go

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
through one of these

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,720
um i can't imagine the pressure that is

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,599
involved

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,080
if you're going through one of these but

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,840
there are a lot of other

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
pr crises that might be a little bit

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
more subtle that occur

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
regularly so one of them is a social

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280
media emergency

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,000
this one could be that you have a user

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
that is talking about your product or

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
service

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
and they're talking about a negative

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,680
experience

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,879
with that product or service and if this

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
gets a lot of attention

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,640
a lot of likes that can be pretty

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,239
damaging to your brand

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,360
the other thing that could happen is

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,840
with sodium social media influencers

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
uh you know if you have an influencer

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
that is talking negatively about your

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
brand

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,840
uh that can really be uh quite damaging

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,840
pretty

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
quickly

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,640
another type of pr crisis that can

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
happen is

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,879
a bad release crisis

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
and target had one of these a few years

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,599
ago

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,599
they've released a new version of their

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
website right before the primary

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,040
shopping

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,480
season of the year and they also did it

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,400
right as they were launching

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,879
a new brand onto the target

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
platform and so there were a lot of eyes

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,359
on their experience at that point in

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,280
time

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,919
and they put out a new release with a

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,880
new look and feel that wasn't stable

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,479
and so users immediately were having

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,080
negative reactions because

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,160
they couldn't get anything done they

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,520
were failing their tasks

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
and they were posting about it

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,199
so you don't you know this is a kind of

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,000
the release caused to this

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,320
is what happened and then another

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,280
release mistake that i've seen happen

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
uh pretty often is that teams get

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,560
excited about

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,919
you know taking their their product or

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
service from

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,240
what it's running on today and adopting

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,440
modern technology moving it forward into

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
the future

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,440
but as part of doing that you're you're

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,639
taking a legacy system with a lot of

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
different

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,400
um capabilities and often you can't

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
release it

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,880
again on a new technology with all the

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,840
same capabilities

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
so you've kind of brought down the the

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,759
amount of

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,560
um capability that your product has and

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
you're expanding

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
you're expecting to expand that back to

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,600
what it used to be over time

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
uh the problem here can be that in that

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
first mvp release

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,120
you didn't actually meet the primary use

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,360
cases that your users

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,560
really needed and so they're now not

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,960
uh really happy with the end result

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
because you're not meeting their core

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,800
needs in the offering that you gave them

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
even though it's now on better and newer

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,360
technology

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
and last but not least the internal

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,039
emergency i would say this is

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,560
the most common kind of crisis that i

00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,039
have experienced as a

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,639
user experience professional and um

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,120
you know this this happens

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,560
more often than i like to say and it has

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
happened at red hat it's happened at

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,479
other companies that i've worked at and

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,400
thankfully it's internal so you're not

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,199
in the public eye dealing with this it's

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
just um

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,120
you know kind of internally there's a

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
little bit of chaos maybe and you're

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
trying to like get things

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
moving faster because there's a lot of

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
attention on it

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,840
so this what does this look like usually

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,520
this looks like a ceo or other high

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,400
level executive tries to use your

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,319
product

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
um something isn't working the way they

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
expect and

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,639
they kind of raise that red flag across

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,639
the company and say hey

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,000
i just tried this what's happening why

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,880
is this not working

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,720
and this happened at red hat we had

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
several different products that

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,000
should have worked together quite

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
seamlessly unfortunately they were not

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
working together as seamlessly as they

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,400
should have

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
because of some architectural

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,880
differences that were underlying them

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
and because of that you know our

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,039
executive tried them

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
couldn't get them working together and

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,120
uh came back

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,199
to you know us as a company engineering

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,280
team and ux team and said

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,440
what's going on like this is not working

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,560
and this is not what we should be

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,039
sending out to our customers um so this

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
is

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,440
probably the best kind of crisis because

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,360
it's generated internally

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,720
it's going to make a difference but you

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
don't have to worry about

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,319
what's going on outside of the company

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,759
at the same time

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,919
so the next thing i'm going to move on

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,960
to is talking about how do you

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,880
actually handle this usability crisis

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
but before i move on i'll take a break

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
here to see if there's any questions

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
about the types of crises that i talked

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
about

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,120
we don't have any questions so far all

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,120
right

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,199
okay so you're here

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,360
there's usability crisis what do you do

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,360
the first thing you should do is to

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,960
reframe

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,240
as usability professionals um often

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,520
we are already uh

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
identifying a lot of the problems in the

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,680
uh product usability and product

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,879
releases that we are working on

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,400
so we might have you know a list of of

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,599
situations where we

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,919
feel like hey you know we already knew

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,720
that this wasn't stable we already knew

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,839
that

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,360
um this user journey was a little

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,080
uh you know risky or not ideal

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,000
we already knew that the design was a

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,040
little disjoint between

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,600
one system to another so we might have a

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,720
list of things that we feel like we have

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,560
um maybe already raised the flag about

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
to the company we've already tried to

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
speak our two cents about and say that

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,200
we weren't

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,080
comfortable with uh as part of a release

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,440
and so it's very easy at this point in

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,680
time to

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
go into victim mode and to be like you

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,320
know i told you so

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,800
i told you so we knew there was problems

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
and now here we are uh but that's not

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,480
the right place to be that's not where

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,560
you want to be to handle this pr crisis

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
so as quickly as possible you want to

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
let the past go

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
and move from being that victim to being

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,839
a leader

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,800
this is your opportunity to really think

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,920
about

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,680
how does uh the user experience practice

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
in your company

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,519
advance and how can you show what your

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
team can do

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,600
right now in this crisis and what it can

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
do in the future to prevent future ones

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,320
once you've been able to change your own

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,600
mindset and really understand that

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,399
this is a great opportunity you also

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
need to pass

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,640
that new mindset on to your team you

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,720
need to invigorate your team

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
and make sure that they understand that

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
this is a great opportunity

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,720
for us to bring user experience

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,320
practices into the company

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,200
really showcase what our teams can do

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,240
and what design impact can have on

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,040
product development

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,279
if we're doing it the right way at the

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,680
same time we are in a crisis

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
so it's gonna be hard work right now so

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,920
you need to prepare your team for the

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,200
fact that

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,720
we're gonna go um you know

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,959
nose to the grindstone we're really

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,120
gonna be working hard for a little bit

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,360
of time here to get through this crisis

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
but on the other side of it this is

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,720
going to be a huge opportunity

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,720
and open doors for us in a new way

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,040
so once you have your mindset and you've

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,160
reframed your ability to look at the

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,399
situation

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,320
you then want to move on to evaluating

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,920
as you evaluate you really want to

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,760
identify what the core

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,000
issue is it's so easy like i said we all

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
have

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,560
this list of things in our mind we might

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
have a whole list of jiras or whatever

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
of

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,680
abusability um issues that we know about

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,079
on the product

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,160
but we need to step away from all of

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,880
that data that we have for a moment

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
and really look at this from the pr

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,839
crisis

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,279
point of view what was that user

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,000
experiencing

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,800
what was their core issue and how do we

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
address

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,720
that problem

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,560
and so identifying the core issue could

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,240
look like a lot of different things

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
if your user if you're looking from the

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,560
user's viewpoint it might be that

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,839
you actually have the capability that

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
they're complaining about or that

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,000
they've raised as a problem

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,839
but they weren't able to find it so you

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,720
have a discoverability issue

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,000
it might be that it's not something that

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
the ux team or

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
designers can fix alone it might be that

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,399
there's a performance issue or stability

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,480
issue

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,680
with the product and you need to

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,440
assemble you know really a whole team

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,959
of people with different expertise

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
around the company to

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,680
address what the core issue is the first

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,519
thing is making sure you really

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,880
know what is going to fix this pr crisis

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,200
and what's at the core

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,200
of what created this problem

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
once you understand what that core piece

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,240
is

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,200
then you can say okay how do i take this

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,600
company

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,880
out of the immediate crisis they are in

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,600
and move them into a better place as

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,240
quickly as possible you need to

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,120
recognize

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,079
that uh executives especially in an

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,600
external

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:48,320
um pr crisis executives product donors

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,440
they're having a big spotlight shown on

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
them right now

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
and it's not a pleasant one and so you

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,360
want to be their ally

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,800
and get them out of that spotlight as

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,519
quickly as possible

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
but also recognize that this is your

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,639
opportunity

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,399
to really stand up for the right thing

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:11,040
as far as user experience goes

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,399
so help them identify how they're going

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,680
to get out of that spotlight

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,920
as quickly as possible and then

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,959
how are you going to help them into the

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,240
future

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,760
continue to have great usability so they

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,760
don't run into this problem again

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,720
and how are you going to do that well we

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,320
want to build a plan

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,560
the first part of your plan should be

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,480
your immediate response plan

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,680
like we're just talking about there's a

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
spotlight

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,760
and that spotlight is bright and not

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,839
very pleasant

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
so your immediate response plan is all

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
about how to get

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
out of that spotlight and how to be able

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,519
to have a

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,480
very um stable

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,760
reliable response to the current

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,360
situation

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,199
you don't want a band-aid response

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
because the worst possible thing

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,279
that you could do at this point in time

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
is band-aid the problem and it comes

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,480
back

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,240
a week later that is going to be worse

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
on your brand than if it takes you a

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,120
little bit longer to get a fix done

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,079
but you fix it the right way so you

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,839
really want to say

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,639
what is the medium viable product of

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,000
what we need to do to have an immediate

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,000
response plan that

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,560
fixes the core problem in the right way

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
for moving forward but fixing the core

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,440
problem

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,560
might mean that you're fixing you know

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,320
just one

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,800
piece of a larger puzzle and so

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,399
you also want to recognize that once we

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,519
get out of that spotlight

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,920
and we fix that one little piece all of

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
these

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,279
other problems potentially

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,160
that are kind of around the perimeter of

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,440
this pr

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,600
crisis that could lead to your next one

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
and so you want to build a roadmap

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,000
that's going to allow you

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,480
to make sure that you start fixing all

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,959
of those

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:12,720
other areas so that we don't fall into

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:13,839
the situation again

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,399
the last thing you're going to want to

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,399
do is to communicate

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,399
very clearly during this process

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,279
the first question is should we release

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,680
anything publicly

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,440
and answering this question is not

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,560
simple and it's situational

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,279
so it's going to really depend on

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
exactly what's happening for you my best

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,399
advice

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,079
is to involve your marketing and pr

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,199
teams because they're experts

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,360
at this domain so involve them

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,040
have the conversation think through

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,759
thoroughly

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,759
what is happening and whether it's

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,120
something that you can address publicly

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,959
in the right way or if making a public

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
statement is just going to add fuel to

00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,759
the fire

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,920
there might be still be doubt in the

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,959
company or doubt in the brand and that's

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,959
just going to create

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,440
more negative attention and kind of like

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,720
draw out the negative attention cycle

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,240
um so we don't want to do that if that's

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,480
the path that you know your

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,279
your team is thinking it's going to go

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,600
uh

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,600
alternatively if you have something that

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,720
you know you can really definitively say

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,519
you're going to do in response to

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,160
this pr crisis and you can show good

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,720
merit

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,680
on the way to that path already then it

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
might be viable

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,920
to release something publicly to talk

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,199
about what you're doing

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,040
what you've already done what you're

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,839
going to do and what's your full plan

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,440
um in the future and really put users

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,839
minds at ease that you're listening to

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,360
them

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,800
and that you're taking real action from

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,800
uh from this situation

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,920
regardless of whether you release

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,240
something publicly

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,720
an internal communication plan is going

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,920
to be key

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,959
talking internally you're going to want

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
to

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,199
capture a couple of different internal

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
stakeholders the first set of

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,760
stakeholders

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,959
if you are in an external pr crisis

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,000
are people that do have connection

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,280
external from the company so they are

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,679
speaking with customers they're speaking

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,360
um you know maybe on social media or

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,959
other platforms they have external

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,640
communication paths

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
you want to make sure that they all have

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,320
a common message

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
and they all know how to address the

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,240
problem

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,640
because especially you know in a public

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,160
pr crisis you know other people are

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,080
going to be asking questions

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
about it so you need to have a

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,240
consistent

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,080
internal response plan in place so that

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,320
everybody has the same messaging

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,160
to use when they're meeting with

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,280
customers or in these situations

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,320
the second group of people is

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,200
your stakeholders who are in the

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,120
spotlight

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,400
your executives your leaders your

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,080
product owners

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,799
um anybody else that is responsible

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,480
um at the end of the day for the product

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,000
the company the brand the platform

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
this set of stakeholders you want to

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
make sure that you are communicating

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,720
very clearly with them

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
what that immediate response plan is

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,240
that you're putting into place

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,039
and then what that road map is that's

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,400
going to help in the long run

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:34,000
this is at the absolute best

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,919
time to make big

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,679
ux requests um and it doesn't

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,000
initially feel like that because you

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,480
feel like i just have to address their

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,120
immediate problem we'll worry about how

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,039
to fix

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,799
you know the fact that we had these ux

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,600
mistakes in the product process

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,720
later once we're out of the situation

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
but the reality is

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,480
right now they are feeling the pain of

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
the decisions that were made in those

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,679
product development processes

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,960
uh up to this point and it's it's fresh

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,799
it's something that they're thinking

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,840
about so this is the best time to make

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,880
those big ass

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,720
about how to change ux processes ux

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,840
resourcing

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,760
future ux planning etc

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,559
and you don't need all the answers to

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,039
that but you need to

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,799
make it clear that you have that roadmap

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,679
and you have

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,360
expectations around what you need in

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,360
order to make this better in the future

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,320
and then the last group that you want to

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,440
make sure you're communicating

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,760
internally to

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
is the teams that are going to help you

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,520
execute

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,280
on this immediate response plan and

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,600
also the roadmap overall

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,600
everybody should understand how their

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
role fits into this roadmap

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,880
and what they can do to support the

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
current problem

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
so we want to make sure that we bring

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,799
all the teams together that are going to

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,480
be part of that immediate response plan

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,559
and communicate what they should be

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,159
doing and how they should be executing

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,760
and what their deadlines are to meet

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,880
that plan

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,360
and then we should be also

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,039
giving them a glimpse into the road map

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
and an idea of where we're headed in the

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,000
future

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
so that they understand the longer term

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,679
plan and how to

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
proceed in the future to make sure that

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,159
we are

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,919
executing in a new way and building out

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,679
all of those extra pieces we talked

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:34,720
about that might need to be fixed around

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:38,320
that core problem

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,240
once the pr crisis is over

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,559
you've gotten out of it everybody's out

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,320
of the spotlight people are breathing a

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,240
big sigh of relief

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,640
we've made it you're not done

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,159
you now have that continued execution on

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,799
that roadmap

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
and you have the opportunity now to

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,520
continue

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,840
a line of communication with those

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,679
high-level stakeholders

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
that you might not have talked to on a

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,039
regular basis before

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,520
and this is i think one of the

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,640
biggest opportunities that these pr

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,440
crisis bring

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
for ux professionals often it can be

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,520
hard

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
for ux professionals to make inroads and

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,640
having

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,360
time with um executives and making sure

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,200
that

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,360
their point of view in the product

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,159
development process is heard

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,320
and this is a door opening for you this

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,480
is an opportunity to say

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,360
hey we're here we're here to support

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,120
this crisis

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,240
we're doing everything we can to make

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,919
sure that we get you out of the

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,760
spotlight

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,679
but we want to continue the conversation

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,360
long term we want to talk about how

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,200
ux can play a big part of your future

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,880
in a new way so that we don't do this

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
again and so

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,320
as you execute on that road map you want

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
to make sure that you're setting up

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,600
milestones where you can come back to

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,360
those executives

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
show progress and continue the

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,240
conversation about how ux improvement

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,960
happens

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,960
at your company

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,120
so in summary if you're in a usability

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,440
emergency

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,480
you should reframe you want to change

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,240
that mindset as

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,520
quickly as possible from victim to

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,520
leader and bring your team with you

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,039
then you want to move on to evaluate and

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
understand that core problem

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,640
really know how you're going to get

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,159
those stakeholders out of that spotlight

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
as quickly as possible

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,200
what is the thing that's going to really

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,880
make that happen

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,960
and how are we going to do it in a way

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,400
that ensures

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,880
it's done right and this same problem

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,960
won't occur again and cause damage to

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,320
your brand

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,159
then we're going to build that immediate

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,000
response plan and start executing as

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,320
quickly as possible on that plan to get

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,400
those stakeholders out of that spotlight

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
and also make sure that we're building

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,960
that full map so that

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,880
we're not just you know responding to

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,840
this situation but we're building a

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,919
better platform for our future

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
and last but not least we're going to

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,360
communicate

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,320
about all of these pieces as much as

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,919
possible

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,480
we might choose to communicate

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,320
externally we might not depending on the

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,360
situation

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,760
but we're definitely going to

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,280
communicate internally and

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,200
make sure that we continue that

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,919
communication

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,200
with our internal stakeholders over time

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,200
after this crisis ends

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,960
that's why i had to share today so thank

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,840

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:50,559
[Music]

couldn't be happier

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,720
and radic how often do you deal with a

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,960
big crisis

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,960
um you know facebook's scale

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,520

and i hope in my career i never have to

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,320
deal with that

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,960
um that like i said i can't even imagine

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,840
the amount of pressure that that would

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,039
um

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,559
put on on a person on a team um that's

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,039
really tough

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,080
so i don't think we have those those

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,279
like full meltdown

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,559
crisises often but they do they happen

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:41,200
obviously um i think what's more

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,120
common is uh like i said definitely the

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
internal crisis and those can

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,320
those can be rather big depending on the

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,320
company and the culture and how that

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,240
um how that comes down um

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,520
you know here at red hat i think we have

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,840
a very positive

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,120
good culture so the crisis we went

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,880
through was not

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,240
targeted at a person or a team it was a

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,720
uh it was much more of a whoa

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,760
you know we got to this place this isn't

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,240
great

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,400
let's fix it let's put some focus on

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,600
this and build a plan and see if we can

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,919
really fix it

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,080
um and that's that's i think the best

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,400
case scenario where everybody's coming

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,200
at

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,120
the problem as a combined effort and

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,360
really trying to solve it together

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,880
and recognizing that like we're we're in

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,279
a place this isn't the greatest

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,640
but we found it we found our issues

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,159
let's fix them

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,679
um social media uh

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,240
problems are becoming more and more

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,440
common and so i think we do see those

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,760
uh those can again you know depending on

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,840
the

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,679
the culture the company culture i think

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,799
those can range from

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,039
glitches um you know or or actually

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,240
just opportunities to reach out to users

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,720
and build a relationship

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,480
and um mend those fences and it's like

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,760
not a big crisis at all

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,000
too serious crisis because

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,679
there's no real way of handling it in

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,960
the company and there's no

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,039
good communication mechanisms to

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,200
address users problems at the small

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,720
scale before they turn into

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,720
kind of big scale problems

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,679
i hope that answers that question if i

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,000
kind of went around your question

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,559
feel free to ask ask it a new way and

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,559
i'll try again

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,200
and how do you best communicate when you

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,520
truly can't give a good answer with the

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,840
information you presently have

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:41,039
uh beverly do you mean communicate

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,039
externally to users

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,559
okay um

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,440
yeah so this gets back to that like when

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,640
do we speak externally

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,960
um and how do we speak externally the

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,440
tone can mean a lot as well

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:03,679
and recognizing um what your brand

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,080
uh your brand

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,400
value and stances already can make a big

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,400
influence on this as well so

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,600
you know facebook is an easy example so

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,520
i'm going to take them for a minute

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,559
let's say you know

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,760
facebook had a a privacy

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,919
crisis they then uh

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,840
you know post to their users on feeds

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,360
hey you know we're gonna make some

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,960
updates to our privacy

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,799
uh we've heard you well unfortunately

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,080
you know some people might take that in

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,399
a positive light and

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,320
some people might really not take that

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,120
in a very positive light because

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,039
the brand reputation for protecting my

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,960
data has already been

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,279
so um destroyed at that point

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,960
that it just sounds like lip service and

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,039
so without telling me

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,880
something real about how you're gonna

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,279
change my privacy settings

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,480
uh i don't feel like i trust anything

00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,520
that you're telling me in the first

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,760
place so

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,679
i think that really gets into like

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,640
understanding

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,600
when to communicate to your users do you

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,679
need to

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,520
just take the heat for a little while

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,159
and go get some stuff done while that

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,720
heat

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,000
comes in and then come back when you

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,600
have something to show for

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,440
it and you really have information and

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,159
real answers um

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,919
or should you you know do you have a

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,880
brand reputation

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,679
that's good enough that you can respond

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,559
to that user

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,480
without any real kind of data or good

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,960
information behind it and just say

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,080
hey we've heard you we're so sorry this

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,600
happened to you

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,279
we're gonna we're looking at it right

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,240
now and we'll come back soon with some

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,080
answers

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,840
and so that's really gonna depend on on

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,840
your brand reputation

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,279
and radek do you help with communication

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,559
for the big security issues

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,320
meltdown health bleed etc i guess the

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,760
way we talk about red hat customers

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,080
about this is important and we need some

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,799
consistency in the messaging

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,520
that's a great question um no i have not

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,520
uh

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,200
the ux team has not been involved in

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,440
security issues and

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,360
the pr communication for those um

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,559
i would absolutely be interested in

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,960
talking with the

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,720
the marketing and pr teams about how

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,320
that is handled and how we

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,760
talk about those um so i actually might

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,279
follow up after this

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,960
this talk and see if i can find the

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,720
right contacts to have that conversation

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,279
because i think that would be

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,799
a really interesting use case of yeah we

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,799
had a security issue

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,279
at the end of the day that is you know

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,399
security is part of your experience with

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,120
our products

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,399
um how do we handle those and how do we

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,480
make sure that users are

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
getting what they need i think the good

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,880
news is that

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,760
um open source and um red hat

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,080
uh you know in general is well known for

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,240
being very open and transparent

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,080
with these security issues and so like i

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,080
was just talking about brand reputation

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,440
red hat has built a brand reputation

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,440
where we can go out

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,159
and talk about these very openly and

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,399
honestly and transparently

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,279
and give users tools as quickly as

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,039
possible

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,320
to do something about those security

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,600
issues um

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,960
and we make it through those crisis uh

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,399
crisis pretty smoothly because of how we

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,840
handle those situations

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,320
so i think that's actually a really

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,600
great example of

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,360
company reputation tied into

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,360
crises and how we handle them

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:40,000
all right any other

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,000
questions

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,320
all right well thank you everybody for

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,279
