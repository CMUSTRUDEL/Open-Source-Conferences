How to use an end-to-end flow to guide a project and the team to a shared vision.

In an open source project there will often be many different opinions on what problems the project should solve, where the users (who are often also the contributors) want to focus their time, and how to implement the solutions. Journeymapping can help identify the most important places to focus.

Using a successful open-source project we’ll demonstrate how the process works and how we were able to get all stakeholders to agree to a project plan and issues that focused on the end user. From interviews with stakeholders and subject matter experts, through the in-person workshop that went off the rails 5 minutes before we started, to the final assembly of the steps and feedback to the team, we’ll explain the journey and how you can implement it on your project.
