Title: We Won. Now What?
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Ben Cotton

Not too long ago, the open source movement was a plucky underdog fighting to establish a better way of making software. Now it’s the default, with companies who used to be antagonists serving as the biggest cheerleaders for open source software. But it’s not time to pack up and go home. As open source’s place in the world has changed, so must the focus and approach.

In this session, we’ll look at the present and future of the open source movement. What can openness do with its newfound power? And what happens if we don’t use it wisely?

hi welcome to we won now what

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,600
this is uh being presented for devconfus

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,440
2020 i'm ben cotton

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,480
i'm here to offer some opinions to you

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,480
for the next 45 minutes

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,920
so start off with some boilerplate as i

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
usually do

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,160
let's talk about it i want to make this

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,600
a thing that we can discuss

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,199
if you have constructive comments you

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
can at me on twitter

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,439
you can hang around for the q a

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,199
afterwards

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,560
if you have non-constructive comments

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,560
you can keep them to yourself

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,840
so now usually when somebody gives a

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,360
talk they have some disclaimers right so

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,120
you know these are not my employers

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,040
opinions these are not my projects

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
opinions i'm speaking for myself blah

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,039
blah blah

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,719
and that that very much applies here uh

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,840
you'll see that i'm not wearing any

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
brand of apparel

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,600
and that's for a good reason um just

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,399
pretend like you don't know anything

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,600
about me or what i do for a living

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,960
cool but also i have an unusual

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,400
disclaimer for you

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,000
that this might not even be my opinion

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
there are things in here where i'm not

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,040
entirely sure i agree with what i'm

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,720
saying

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
and you're more than welcome to also

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,000
disagree with that

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,479
this talk is really about presenting

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,840
some thoughts and ideas and a way

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,680
to think about the future not

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
necessarily to prescribe a future

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,720
to that end i have another unusual

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,880
disclaimer and that is

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,799
this talk i think will ask more

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
questions than it answers

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
there is a question mark in the title of

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
the talk that should be your first

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
indication

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,280
so what's this all about

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,759
so this talk uh the idea came to me

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,600
in the before time this was october of

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,840
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
i was in raleigh north carolina for

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,200
opensource.com

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
annual community moderator then now

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
correspondent

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,360
summit and we were talking with red

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,600
hat's

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
uh chief people officer d'alyssa

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,880
alexander

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,440
about the history of opensource.com site

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,440
was celebrating its 10th anniversary

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
and we were just talking about like you

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,560
know look how far we've come

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
in 10 years because 10 years ago people

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
didn't really understand open source

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
especially in enterprises it was scary

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,120
to them and now opens the default like

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
we've won isn't that great

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
so i asked her a question i said where

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
do you see

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,519
10 years from now what what will this

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
conversation be like then what's the big

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,519
difference

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,120
and my friends i really wish that i had

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
been taking notes or something because

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
she gave an answer that i thought was

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,519
really insightful and i have no

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,760
idea what it is now

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
sorry about that but it did get me

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
thinking over the course of the next few

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,760
days like

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,760
well if we've won like

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
what does that look like what what we

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
where do we go from here like once

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,440
you've won

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,720
what else is there to do so open is the

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
default choice

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,920
i present to you some evidence that

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,200
we've won in case you don't agree

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,360
you might remember in 2001 steve ballmer

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
was at microsoft and he said linux is a

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,879
cancer

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,159
and cancer is generally a thing people

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,920
don't like they don't

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,640
think kindly of it it's bad right

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,599
and balmer and others thought that the

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,560
gpl was like a virus that infected

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,360
uh other software and that it would just

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
destroy

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
the way they viewed the world if it were

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,799
allowed to

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,159
you know continue and then in 2015

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,159
microsoft loves linux

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,480
so you might you might not agree

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,959
that microsoft loves linux you might

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,959
question

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,959
their motivations that's fair

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,319
do they love linux because they realize

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
the linux can't be stopped

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,599
maybe do they love linux because they

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,120
realize they can make a bunch of money

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,959
being supportive of linux probably

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
like maybe it's not a profound

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
philosophical realization maybe it's

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,920
strictly commercial

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,599
but either way they're a huge

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,199
contributor to linux and

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
open source in general now and that's

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
good and i can tell you

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,040
from when i worked at microsoft a couple

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,080
of years ago

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,000
like they're sincere about it they may

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,840
not have the same motivations that all

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,759
that others do but they are legitimately

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
loving linux this is not an embrace

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,479
extend extinguish kind of situation

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,240
uh when i worked in the azure marketing

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,440
team

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
the fact that linux v virtual machine

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,040
usage

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,040
was outpacing windows that was a cause

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
for celebration we were graded on that

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
like that was an important part of what

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,280
we were trying to do

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,759
now granted microsoft is a country a

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,199
company of 150 000 people i've almost

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,440
said country which

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,440
i mean it could be anyway

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,800
the the love for linux isn't evenly

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,039
distributed

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
within business units or even within you

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,039
know individuals within

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,120
the ones that do but it's there and it's

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,320
sincere

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,320
now you remember me remember in 2004 our

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
friends at canonical opened ubuntu bug

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,639
number one

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,240
microsoft has a majority market share

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,120
that was a bug that they needed to solve

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,120
in 2013 mark shuttleworth left a very

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,360
lengthy comment that you can't read

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
but it's just there for visual

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,919
prettiness

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,840
basically saying fine like this isn't

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,600
what we need to focus on anymore

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,600
we're good they closed it

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,680
now microsoft still has a majority

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,280
market share

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,560
but maybe we don't care as much

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,880
and you know for years the year of linux

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,160
on the desktop was a big joke

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,199
and the year the linux desktop is here

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,080
it's called android and chrome os like

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,880
more people are using linux today than

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
we

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,919
probably ever would have thought 10

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,919
years ago they're just

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,360
maybe not using a typical linux

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,360
distribution like we thought about

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,240
and you know open standards are being

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,039
embraced too

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,960
jack dorsey uh on twitter was talking

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,360
about maybe putting together a team of

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
uh

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,360
engineers and stuff to develop an open

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,319
standard for social media

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,400
so he can decentralize it now he got a

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,400
lot of flack about this because

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
i mean there are already open standards

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,960
that are very twitter like that

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,479
twitter could just participate in

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,479
but you know his reasoning is

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,680
email for as much as we hate it

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,800
has worked really well ish for the last

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,240
decades because it's built on open

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,160
standards and you don't

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
need to be on gmail to email another

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
gmail user right

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
you can email whoever you want which is

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,080
both a blessing and a curse

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,759
but jack dorsey says hey

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
open this is good for my platform right

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,039
all right so now what do we do that

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,800
we've won well

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,639
unfortunately we can't all retire to the

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
beach as much as i would really love to

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,479
just sit there with a bottle of whiskey

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
and a stack of good detective novels and

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,759
a

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
big umbrella because sunburn

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,840
we can't do that yet we're not there

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,919
but i got to thinking you know

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,280
does the fact that we've won to explain

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
some of the tumult that we've seen in

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,400
open source lately

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
so i developed a hypothesis that we're

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,919
not actually going to test but i'm just

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,160
going to put this out here

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,759
my hypothesis is that open source

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,400
contributors have agreed to an

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,160
unsp unspoken truce in order to defeat

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,560
proprietary software

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
and now that we've won we're able to

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
resume our infighting so what am i

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,639
talking about here

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,560
like remember back in the day when

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,479
people get into fierce battles over

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,240
which text editor was better

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,120
and the right answer is the one you're

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,039
using is a good text editor that's fine

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
but we spent a lot of energy fighting

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,000
over this we thought about which linux

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,520
distribution to use

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
thought about which desktop environment

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,639
to run which license to use

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,479
and none of this really matters because

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
people can use what they want and that's

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,960
one of the great things about open

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
source is that there's lots of choices

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,479
to choose from and you can go

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
participate in

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
whatever community you want and help

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
make it more

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,159
better

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,240
and we kind of stopped doing that after

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
a while and maybe because we were

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
focused on

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,080
the outside and now we turning it back

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,880
to the inside

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,399
so what am i talking about here well one

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,680
maybe we're writing new licenses

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,279
to solve old problems

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,279
it seems like more licenses are being

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,720
submitted to the open source initiative

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,399
lately this is the body that defines

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,240
what open source is they have the

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,320
capital letters open source definition

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,519
and these licenses aren't just people

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
sitting there going i'm going to write a

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,000
license because it's fun

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,720
which it is but these are people

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
getting actual lawyers to write licenses

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,680
that people can actually use

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
and we're seeing an uptick in that and

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,480
maybe it's because they're like oh all

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,720
right now it's time to solve some other

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,839
problems

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,240
uh one that was recently approved

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,000
went through a very long process and got

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
bruce parents to quit the open source

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
initiative

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,120
because he thought the they're heading

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,480
the wrong direction

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
that was not minor news

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,360
but one of the things that we'll come

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,720
back to a little bit later is this

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,920
observation

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,839
that data and software are merging

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
and we used to think soft of software is

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,480
this this thing

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,920
that was just sort of contained and off

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,120
to the side and that's maybe not the

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,360
case anymore

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,040
so what are the one of the other things

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,000
that we're starting to see

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,360
uh for this typified by the hippocratic

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
license

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
and if you're familiar with the

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,560
hippocratic oath it's what doctors

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,880
promise to do when they doctor and it

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,959
says first do no harm

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
so if you can't help the patient at

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
least don't make them worse

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,880
that seems like a pretty good thing and

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,680
the idea behind this license and others

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,920
like it

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,519
is that if i put a lot of energy into

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,720
making the software i don't want it to

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,720
be used by the bad guys

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,240
now you can see where the difficulty is

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,440
there is like who defines

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,519
what the bad guys are and

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,920
i think most people who make tools of

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,279
any kind whether they be automobiles or

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:55,600
software or firearms or

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,200
kitchen knives or any other tool

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,120
they don't want it to be used for bad

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
purposes you want

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,000
you're making this thing because you

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,000
want to make the world better somehow

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,360
but it's really hard to define that in a

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,320
way that people can agree with

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,320
and frankly it's not open source now

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,480
that doesn't mean it's good or bad

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,079
it just means that because it restricts

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,120
field of endeavor it cannot be

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
considered open source

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,680
another problem that we've started to

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
come up with is

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,839
the oh no this isn't a business model it

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
turns out you can't just say

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,000
this software is open source and make a

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,160
bunch of money off of it

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
now red hat has been extremely

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,720
successful

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,800
in producing and selling support for

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,880
open source software

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,399
to the tune of two plus billion dollars

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,640
a year and then being

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,240
the largest software company acquisition

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,200
ever

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,600
that's good frankly not a lot of

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,000
companies have had that level of success

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
and i'm not here to say whether red hat

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,440
has been good or lucky or both

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,440
but there's probably some of each

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,920
but it turns out that it's more than

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,959
just being open

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,600
to make money and

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,600
it turns out that if amazon web services

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,160
wants to take the code you wrote

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,120
and make an as a service offering based

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
on it

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,040
they're going to make a whole boatload

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,639
of money and the license you chose

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,000
doesn't obligate them to give any of

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,240
that money to you

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
now you can again make the case that

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
ethically

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,160
they are uh

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,600
you know strongly encouraged to do that

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
they have an obligation there

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,480
you could certainly say from a business

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,360
perspective if they don't want to have

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,959
to keep developing it themselves

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
it's in their interest to make sure that

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,760
the upstream project is well funded and

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,839
viable but there's no like real

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,000
obligation for it like no legal

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,079
obligation

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,279
and so we had a few projects that just

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,519
kind of wrote their own licenses that

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,639
my interpretation of them is basically

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,279
you can use it don't

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,040
make amazon web services out of it and

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,200
people were rightly like okay but that's

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,839
not open source you can do whatever you

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,639
want

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,360
but don't call it open source mongodb

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,600
for example

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
had to be removed from the fedora repos

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,320
because the server side public license

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
not open source so thor i can't ship it

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,560
so we've won but that's not enough

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
because we're still there's still

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,639
problems for us to solve

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,839
but then maybe the question is actually

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
have we really won

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,440
what does it mean to win what does

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,440
winning look like

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,839
so the state of technology these days is

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,839
a little bit of a garbage fire

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,600
we talk about the algorithm like it's

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,199
going to save

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,160
us like we can take this this math

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
and shove it in on some thinking rocks

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
and

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,880
save so much human effort and be more

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,320
reliable

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,839
and uh not have to subject

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,519
underpaid contractors to viewing all the

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,519
terrible things that facebook

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
makes them do to make sure it's not

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
something that should be removed from

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
the platform

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
and we can do all these things and make

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,320
everything so much better

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,320
and more automated and driverless cars

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
yeah

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,399
the algorithm won't save us because it

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,839
turns out

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,560
the algorithm is only as good as

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,440
the people that make it and the data

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,399
that goes into it

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,519
so when there was an algorithm that

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,680
helps determine

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,440
levels of healthcare and what kind of

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,600
healthcare treatments people received

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
it turns out black patients got less

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,160
from that algorithm

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,480
because historically in the u.s it turns

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,040
out

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,959
there have been some uh some racial

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
injustices

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,639
and perhaps there's some biases in the

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
system that were perpetuating with that

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
so amazon said you know what it's really

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,120
a problem for us

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,000
that we are not having the diversity in

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
our company that

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,880
represents the population at large right

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
you know studies have shown that more

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,040
diverse companies

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,880
produce better results so they had a

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,160
secret ai recruiting tool

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,440
that they were going to use to help

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,800
screen resumes and get rid of bias

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,600
except it showed bias against women why

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,040
because in technology we have largely

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
had a problem with bias

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,920
against women over the decades and so

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,560
the algorithm is just learned from what

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,560
we've given it

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,440
face recognition software now let's

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,279
set aside the argument for a moment that

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
facial recognition software not working

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,720
is actually a good thing

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,639
um it's facial recognition is used

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,759
for a lot of bad purposes by a lot of

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,600
regimes around the world

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
it's also kind of useful you pull out

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
your iphone you hold it up like you're

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
going to do anyway you're going to put

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
it in front of your face and it just

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,639
says oh

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,000
there you are and unlocks for you that's

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,839
kind of nice

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,360
but it turns out that facial recognition

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,839
software works really well

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,360
for white men and less well for others

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,880
and so let's talk about faces a little

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,560
bit

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,199
recently on twitter i saw a uh a project

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
where

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,320
they would take a pixelated version of a

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,360
face and

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,240
try and de-pixelate it with ai

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,480
so former u.s president barack obama is

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,600
famously a black man

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,360
and when the his picture was fed through

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,880
that algorithm

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,759
it turned into some vaguely white dude

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,720
but it's not just him somebody posted a

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,680
picture of

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,959
his wife who was of asian descent and

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,559
she turned into a vaguely white person

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:08,319
and so did actress lucy liu

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,520
huh this seems problematic

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,280
you know what's even more problematic

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,039
when the facial recognition algorithm

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,880
says that that's the guy that's the one

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,799
who did the crime

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,839
and it turns out no it very much is not

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,839
the one who did the crime

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,839
reporters did some reporting as

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,640
reporters are want to do

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,840
and they found out that in detroit the

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,240
facial recognition

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,080
error rate was 96 percent 96.

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
now i want to take a bit of a moment to

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,919
take a detour

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,559
make this a little bit personal my

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,360
undergraduate degree is in meteorology

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,200
and weather forecasting is notoriously

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,120
very difficult

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,799
meteorologists have a reputation of

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,600
being wrong all the time and people are

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,919
like

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,440
you can keep you can be wrong 50 of the

00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,240
time and keep your job

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:05,840
that's awful 50 of the time

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,679
96 failure rate 96

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,919
you could just guess and be better than

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,919
that

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,000
so garbage in garbage out became garbage

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,320
in garbage fire

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,919
but not necessarily on purpose i'm not

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,360
here to say that the people who wrote

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,640
those algorithms or provided the

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,200
training data sets

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,640
are doing anything with malicious intent

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,080
i don't believe that's the case

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,600
i think they don't think about

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,880
these things because they don't have to

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,880
that's what we call privilege

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,679
so now maybe the idea is we just need to

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,160
be more aware of what we're doing and

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,400
think about the ramifications of it

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,679
because it turns out there are

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,919
ramifications

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,200
so maybe what we need to do is not worry

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,320
about winning but just

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,760
get better every day right like

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,480
wake up today like i'm going to be

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,039
slightly less bad than i was before

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,039
progress

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,000
i want to go back to pam's comment on

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,080
about the osi

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,480
mailing list and looking at the new

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,000
model of licenses because

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,679
i think it turns out that while we were

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,440
focused on software

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,880
the data was actually what's important

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,960
and this is the part where i'm going to

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,600
get a little spicy and

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,360
this is the number one slide where i'm

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,720
not sure i agree with myself but here it

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,280
is

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,000
free software is less important than

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,960
reliable

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,960
and protected data

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,640
do you agree with that i don't know if i

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,120
do maybe a more

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,880
agreeable way to say it is free software

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,400
is a necessary but insufficient

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
condition

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
because all the things i've talked about

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,160
with the algorithm and stuff

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,039
mostly these are done with proprietary

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,559
algorithms or proprietary data sets

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,799
but being open source wouldn't

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,280
necessarily fix that

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,440
it's not a magic bomb that fixes

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,159
everything

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
data facebook could open source their

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,480
entire platform they could have been

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,480
open source from day one

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,280
and the data is still the problem not

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
the software

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,679
so let's talk about how some of the ways

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,000
that data is the problem these days

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
for example you have police databases

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
that have

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,200
all kinds of information about people

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,919
and i think most people would agree that

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,039
there are at least

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,840
certain cases where it is desirable for

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,559
law enforcement to have access to

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,880
information

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,400
i think we can spend a lot of time

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
agreeing about where the boundary is and

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
under what circumstances that's

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,240
appropriate

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,600
that's another talk but

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,960
i think most people would agree that

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,760
police officers stalking exes or crushes

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,799
or romantic rivals or people that beat

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,080
them up in high school or whatever

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:02,640
that is a misuse of it there's a word

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,080
for it that happens often enough

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,240
here's something that's a little that's

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,280
even more serious or perhaps

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,440
serious in a different way

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,320
there was an app that was designed to

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,159
help people

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
who are in abusive relationships get the

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,919
resources they need

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,720
to get to a safe place to escape the

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,640
relationship

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,960
or you know do whatever it is they need

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
to do

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,640
this is very important information

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,000
because

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,600
if an abuser knows that someone is being

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
that the person they're abusing is

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,640
trying to get help that can make the

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,320
abuse worse

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,960
it puts lives in danger the app

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,880
had a little bit of a data breach and a

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,200
whole bunch of information got out

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,400
this is life or death stuff friends this

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,440
is not

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,000
some hypothetical situation this is

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,320
putting real people's real lives at real

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,320
risk

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,799
so apart from protecting data there's

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
some other things we could be doing in

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,000
the future

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,000
like fixing our people problems

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,080
so open source is growing but not how it

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,760
should this is the title of a

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,039
summary of the 2019 stack overflow

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,039
developer survey

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,320
i'll show you a few charts from the 2020

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,840
version

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,679
we'll just think a little bit about what

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,440
this means for

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,440
ourselves and for our community

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,640
race and ethnicity

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,799
almost uh 69

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,799
of respondents said they were white

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,840
doesn't sound like it represents the

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,840
population very well

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,679
4.5 are black that's certainly less than

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
the population of the u.s

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,480
percentage wise and well less than the

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,480
global population

00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:01,120
now this seems bad yeah

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:04,880
how about gender roughly 90

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,880
of respondents were men

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,159
i am very sure that

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,120
men do not make up 90 of the world

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,120
population

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,960
physical disabilities i actually really

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
do not like this graph

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,039
because it doesn't have i have no

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,480
physical disabilities to

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,520
scale it but

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,360
approximately 1.1 percent of

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,880
respondents said that they are blind or

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,720
have difficulty seeing

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,000
and it turns out that can be a problem

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,159
because when you design your

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,840
fancy new web page it's got well not

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,799
flash anymore it's like javascript you

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,799
doing stuff everywhere

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,240
screen readers have a hard time with

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
that

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,840
if you have a bunch of emoji in your

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,520
twitter handle screen reader is gonna

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,640
have to sit through and read out every

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,919
emoji

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,600
and if i were blind i would probably

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,799
want to show up at your door and yell at

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,840
you

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,279
for having 20 emoji that every time

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,279
a tweet from you was read i had to sit

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,279
there and listen to each and every emoji

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,600
it's things like not including alt text

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,679
on images and stuff like that like

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,520
these are things where we're excluding

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,480
people for no good reason and

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,400
i'll admit i'm very bad about doing alt

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,520
text on images especially on social

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
media

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,720
i just don't think about it a lot of

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,880
times and that's because i

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,640
personally don't have to but that's bad

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,279
and i should fix that and you should fix

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,880
that

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,400
and if we had more people with physical

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
disabilities represented in our

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,799
communities

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,559
we would think about that more

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:43,360
and age i am 37 years old and i am

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,600
apparently ancient

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,039
half the respondents slightly more than

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,480
half

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,480
are 30 years and younger

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
old people have made a lot more mistakes

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,799
in their careers generally than young

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,960
people

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,400
when you're younger you can make many

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,279
mistakes more quickly but when you're

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
older

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,799
you get to learn how to make bigger

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,279
mistakes

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,640
and this doesn't say that like it's

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,320
better to be old or it's better to be

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
young like there are advantages to both

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
and frankly if you're young you're going

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
to end up

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,840
old hopefully

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,559
but what kind of mistakes are we making

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,559
that we could avoid making if we had

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,960
people who had made mistakes like that

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,960
before

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,520
so we have people problems we have not

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,320
enough contributors

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,039
uh most projects by and large would

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,799
always

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,799
like to have more people helping out in

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,600
some fashion

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,640
because there's always more work to do

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,640
than there is time to do it

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,320
as we've seen our communities are not

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,559
representative enough

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,559
like this is a problem full stop

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,200
heartbleed taught us that there's a lot

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,520
of projects out there that power

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,600
trillions of dollars of economic

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,200
transactions every year

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,080
that don't really get the financial

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,679
support that they need and you got like

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,559
one or two people making pretty low end

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,679
wages for

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,320
technology basically keeping the entire

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,799
world's economy running that seems like

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,799
a problem

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
and there's not enough user education

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,520
and what i mean here

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,320
isn't just like training manuals and

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,880
stuff

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,080
and it very much is not don't use this

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,840
proprietary software's

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,039
proprietary use the open source or the

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,880
free software version because yeah

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,919
i mean yes but also nobody cares

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,000
right it doesn't

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,039
matter that you have a strong

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,159
philosophical

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,840
argument in favor of free software if

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,200
you can't express it in a way that the

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,000
person you're talking to is going to

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
care

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,360
because there are so many things

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,039
in this world for people to care about

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,120
as we have learned in the past

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,600
six months there are so many things

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,720
and nobody can care about all of them

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,720
and if something

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,159
just works for people and they can just

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,880
do it

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,880
then they will

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,240
so you have to we have to be able to

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,679
explain to people in a way that matters

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,600
to them

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:26,000
why it's important to have software

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,679
that they can see or that somebody they

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,039
trust can see

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,039
what it's doing why the data collection

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,840
and data retention and all of that

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,840
matters

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,480
so where do we go from here

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,559
i don't have answers i've given you some

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,679
ideas of things we should think about

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,480
things that maybe we can improve upon

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
but there's a lot between here and there

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,279
and so

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,880
i invite you to spend some time thinking

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,360
about this

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
ten years from now what do you want this

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,200
talk to be about

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,159
what do you hope that we will have fixed

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,880
will improve

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,919
what what definition of winning can we

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,520
set up

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,880
and meet that goal and then move on to

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,679
the next and the next and we can

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,200
iterately

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,279
iteratively improve on ourselves

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,840
as people in our society and our

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,960
technology

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,360
so with that i thank you for your uh

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,320
wrapped attention everyone didn't even

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,159
blink in the audience that was great

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,679
if you have constructive comments

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,760
there's my twitter handle

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,000
again non-constructive comments you are

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,799
cordially invited to keep to yourself

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,559
and i will be available in the q a for

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:45,840
further questions and discussion

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,840
thank you

00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:01,919
hi everybody questions

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:06,399
comments when i gave this talk at

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,960
uh the devconf check back in january

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,480
i very cleverly filled the entire 25

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,200
minutes with talk

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,399
um so i didn't have time for feedback

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:27,840
that was really great but

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:27,840
now i've left myself open to you

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,240
sally asks where i'm broadcasting from

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,799
i'm in lafayette indiana

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,919
and yes jason i did put on a different

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,120
shirt i thought about

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,679
like getting the the black t-shirt and

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,600
the

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,159
sport coat on again was like eh it's

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,159
kind of warm

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,840
uh i believe the shirt is cotton as am i

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,000
oh jen asks can i talk about what my

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,399
vision in the next 10 years may be

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,840
um you know maybe i should have thought

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,840
about that a little bit

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
um

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,000
i'd like to see a world where we're

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,360
using our technology to make life better

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,720
for people

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,039
and i think a lot of times we

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,919
we think we're doing that but we're very

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,840
narrow

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
in what we what we think about and this

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,480
kind of goes back to the the privileged

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,600
thing i was

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
talking about in the talk where we're

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,880
not

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,679
very good at thinking about how our work

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,760
affects people who aren't like us

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,360
and if we can change one thing in the

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,760
next 10 years i hope we

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:51,840
as an industry and as a species can

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,840
get better at that

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,440
langdon asks what will make that happen

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,000
um

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,200
boy i tell you what if uh if i knew the

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,120
answer to that

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,960
you would be paying for my talk instead

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,960
of hearing it for free

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,399
that's i mean that's a really good

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,399
question um

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,760
i think in some ways bad things happen

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,240
happening can help make good things

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,240
happen um

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,600
at some point the the negative effects

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,279
become too loud

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,240
and too too hard to avoid right we can

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,320
no longer

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,159
pretend that we don't know the bad

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,840
effects of what we're doing or what

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,679
other people around us are doing

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,320
um and it really stinks for the people

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,320
who

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,840
uh have to face the negatives in order

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,880
for the positives to happen but i think

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,880
that could be a good driver

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,480
a question is do you see signs of that

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
since open source has been around for a

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,600
while

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,600
what i said about inviting diversity um

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,240
i feel like

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,080
corporate backers of open source have

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,399
done a really good job

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,399
of talking about diversity for a while

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,960
i don't necessarily see

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,640
by and large communities doing a good

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,960
job

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,519
i think there's more acceptance that we

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,200
need to be more diverse and inclusive

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:39,200
um but not necessarily a lot of

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,840
um large-scale

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
improvements there uh there are

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,000
certainly programs that are doing good

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,840
work

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,200
outreachy is one that comes to mind that

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,720
i'm at least partially familiar with

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,399
but i think there's still a long way to

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,399
go very clearly

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,080
do you find codes of conduct helpful are

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,120
communities using it more diverse

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,399
i think they're helpful um i think

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,679
having a code of conduct at its core

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,440
is defining what

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,000
the bounds of acceptable behavior in a

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,760
community are if you were in denise's

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,480
keynote this morning she talked about

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,240
the you know we don't do that here

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,320
um i think a good code of conduct says

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,519
what we don't do that here means for

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,200
that community

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,600
and how the community enforces those

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,600
norms

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,240
our community is using it more diverse i

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,240
don't know

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,480
anecdotally i have seen people refuse to

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,440
participate in communities or

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,559
conferences

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,919
or uh you know other events that

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,919
don't have a code of conduct

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,760
but um you know i don't know that

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,919
there's been any real study

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,679
about uh relative diversity on any axis

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
between communities with and without a

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,080
code of conduct and that's partly

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,039
because

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,000
codes of conduct can vary pretty wildly

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,600
um and so it

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,960
you know really you kind of have to have

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,919
a the taxonomy of codes of conduct in

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,919
order to start with

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:22,720
what program did i use to record um so i

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,919
recorded it with a handheld video camera

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,520
on a tripod

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:31,040
and i used kdenlive to edit it um so as

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,440
i was able to composite the video and

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,679
um the slide so i've exported the slides

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,240
to png files and then imported them and

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,159
then

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,520
was able to do the sometimes slide big

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,480
sometimes slide small

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,480
video and all of that

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,000
i also used audacity to do some noise

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,000
reduction

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,839
on the uh the audio i tried to be as

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,919
noiseless as possible i had the windows

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,599
closed and the air conditioning off

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,680
uh so it got pretty warm in there while

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,960
i was uh doing the recording

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,839
uh but there's just you know traffic

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,480
noise and stuff so i tried to edit that

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,400
out

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,160
another question do you know if there's

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,160
any work going on in trying to bring

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,560
down the huge error rates

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,119
like the 96 percent failure rates for

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,720
the cameras in detroit

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,800
um i'm not specifically aware of those

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,960
but oh my gosh i hope that somebody is

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,200
working very hard on that

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,280
uh because you know that's

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,839
we can't claim to have a justice system

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,960
where we're misidentifying people 96

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,640
of the time and you know like i said

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,560
it'd be much better to just scrap that

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,200
entirely

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,800
you know the question is you know what

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,400
are the incentives i think it was jen

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,680
that made a comment about

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,320
you know microsoft embracing open source

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,960
uh in the interests of money and i think

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,079
a lot of the

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,040
vendors of this kind of

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,160
product as long as somebody's willing to

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,680
write the check for it

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,400
they don't necessarily need to worry

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,359
about how good it is

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,960
um and so i think from you know from

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,400
that perspective the pressure really

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,839
needs to come

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,040
from the public onto their officials

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:15,520
elected or otherwise to really

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,480
step that up i don't think the industry

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,920
itself has much

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:25,280
in much motivation to fix that

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:41,839
beyond um you know the ethical

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:41,839
work of certain individuals

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,119
langdon asks um have you ever heard of a

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,839
hippocratic oath for software devs

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,839
apart from the hippocratic license no

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,839
there are a lot of organizations that

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,520
have a code of ethics

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,160
i know the association for computing

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,599
machinery the acm has one

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,800
the league of professional systems

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,839
administrators lapsa has one

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,200
um you know there are a lot of

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,560
organizations that you know that have

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,599
something like that

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,599
i think part of the problem

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,320
is that even when they exist we don't

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:29,440
necessarily know how to apply them

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,119
um and

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,240
there's a there's some good books that

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,520
have been published in the last few

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,440
years

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,960
about you know including ethics

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,800
as a you know an active part of

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,400
you know curriculum whether it's in

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,480
coding boot camps

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,680
or computer science programs or things

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,800
like that

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,760
you can you know you can get

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,280
four years or you know even get a phd in

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,000
computer science

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,599
and have never taken an ethics class and

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,640
so i think a lot of times we just

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,680
lack the framework um and then you know

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,440
people who have

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,079
come into and from other fields or just

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,040
you know sort of start dabbling and

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,200
fall into technology by accident we

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,800
don't have the theoretical framework to

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,839
apply

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,839
uh some of the ethical principles

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,280
yes i am also not sure why you can get

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,760
out of high school without an ethics

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,160
class

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:32,800
but nobody has asked me to design

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,240
state graduation requirements yet

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,599
uh this is more of an awkward silence

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,599
than a pregnant pause i think

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,440
one of the interesting things about uh

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,480
you know

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,520
the virtual conference idea

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,680
and having the the chat you know here

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,119
is that usually at conferences during

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,640
the q a you have

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,400
the comment disguised as a question

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,400
and here it's okay because you can have

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,599
the comments off in the chat

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,160
and the uh the presenter can feel free

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,880
to

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,880
let the conversation happen but not um

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,920
people aren't going to get up and

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,920
monologue the q a

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,760
sally said awesome talk ben and i will

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,720
point out that that is not a question

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,720
but thank you sally

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,720
i think i have what five-ish minutes

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,720
left

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,320
so if there are other questions in the

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,680
next few minutes

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,520
feel free to pop up otherwise

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,119
i had my twitter handle i'll drop that

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,400
in the chat here in a minute or i'll be

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,920
around

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,920
through most of the rest of the day so

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,760
you can find me in the the hop and chat

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,280
it seems like we've exhausted the

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,160
questions so

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,880
do you want to thank everyone for coming

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,200
and

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,320
having a great conversation in the chat

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,839
both during the talk

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,240
and in the q a it's been uh

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,200
really fun to to watch the feedback in

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,359
real time

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,400
you don't usually get that kind of that

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,480
degree of um

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,960
richness in an in-person presentation

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,000
so i think i will go ahead and shut off

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,680
the video

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,119
and i will hopefully see all of you

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,480
around the rest of the day

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,480
