Title: My Journey Upstream With tlog Testing

	Speaker: Scott Poore

Want to get involved in Open Source but don't know where to start?

Try writing tests!

A lot of projects already have tests upstream with the source code.

As a Quality Engineer working on RHEL, I rarely worked on upstream projects. Most of my tests were written in private Downstream repos. For tlog, I wanted to change that.

To contribute tests upstream I had to learn a different workflow. This presentation will show my journey contributing tests upstream to the tlog project.

Who will benefit from this presentation?
* Anyone writing tests Downstream that wants to move upstream
* Anyone looking to start contributing upstream (with tests!)

What will be covered in this presentation?
* Upstream vs Downstream testing
* A basic upstream workflow
* My experience contributing tests upstream
* Lessons learned

Take-aways from this presentation?
* A better understanding of the upstream contribution process
* A new found desire to start contributing tests upstream
