Title: Herding Cats: Program Management In Communities
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Ben Cotton

Large open source projects are complex. Whether you have someone formally filling the role or not, your project is performing program management tasks. This talk covers some of the key work that program managers perform in community projects. This includes managing schedules, tracking changes, leading meetings, and coordinating resources, with a particular emphasis on how this applies to volunteer communities and not just corporate projects.

hi all welcome

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,120
ben cotton while he presents his talk

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,040
herding cats

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
program management and communities with

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,639
us we'll be starting

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,400
shortly hi welcome to herding cats

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,480
program management and communities

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,840
i'm ben cotton i'm the fedora program

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,520
manager at red hat

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,359
this is kind of my day job here that i'm

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,519
going to tell you about

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
i just want to be clear this is herding

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,240
cats as in getting the

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,160
cats to go in the same direction not

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,119
hurting cats which is bad and you should

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
not do

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,320
don't hurt the cats

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,760
so if you have nice things to say about

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
the talk you want to interact i'm happy

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120
to talk with you about it there's my

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,399
twitter handle i'll be around for q

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,440
a after the talk etc if you have not

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,960
nice things to say

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,079
you can just keep them to yourself

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,800
because nobody is harder on me than i am

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,719
alright so let's get started what is

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
program management

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
you might be asking yourself that maybe

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,800
it's why you came to this talk

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,920
to learn a little bit about it and i'm

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,119
here to answer that

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,240
as soon as i ask this question what is

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,000
project management

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,680
similar different let's ask

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
so the dictionary

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,520
doesn't really talk about it but i've

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
come up with a dictionary here for you

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
projects have single focused results and

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,520
a defined end

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,799
a project is over at some point and it's

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,960
really focused on producing

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,360
output here's a thing that we made isn't

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,720
it nice okay we're done

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,960
programs are made of made up of projects

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
they are composed of projects

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,079
but they don't have a defined end and

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,280
really focused on an

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,280
outcome world domination for example

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,479
and while things like the fedora project

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,000
are called a project they don't actually

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,920
have a defined end

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
and that's just because people who don't

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,640
understand the distinction between the

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,360
two

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,840
uh came up with the names and project is

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
a common word in open source communities

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,599
like

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,120
the thrower project this project or that

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,080
project and they're not really projects

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,319
in this sense

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
and we're going to be okay with that

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,200
because

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,640
words are flexible and they don't have

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,640
to conform to our very strict

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,800
interpretation

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
so the question i asked what is project

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,440
management

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,120
so i asked the project management

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
institute and it seems like the kind of

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
thing that they would know

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,200
and they said the application of

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
knowledge skills tools and techniques to

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,519
project activities to meet the project

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,840
requirements

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,040
that's not helpful that's not helpful at

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
all

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,400
okay so i came up with something for you

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,480
it's basically working with project

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,920
teams to balance these constraints

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,560
time cost scope quality if you adjust

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
one

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
the others are connected and they will

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,159
have to adjust in some way

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,400
uh a lot of times time cost and scope

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,840
are considered the iron triangle of

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
project management so you have this

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
triangle

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
and then like you tie a hot air balloon

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,159
that's quality but apparently quality

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,080
wasn't in a lot of the early project

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,840
management literature because i guess

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,680
it was either taken as an assumed that

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
yes we're not going to make crap

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,400
or that they just didn't care

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,920
you can look at the state of the

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
software industry and decide for

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,879
yourself

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,640
but everyone does project management

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,080
some just do it poorly

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,040
none of things none of the things in

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
this talk are going to be like

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,080
particularly

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,920
new like even if you're not thinking

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,280
about project management or program

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
management you're probably doing the

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,159
activities in some way

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
or you're failing to do them which is

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
also a form of doing them

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,040
so what is program management well once

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,879
again

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,560
i made the mistake of asking the pro

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,400
project management institute

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,239
and they said the application of

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
knowledge skills tools and techniques to

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,480
meet program requirements

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
why they took out program activities in

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,319
this one i don't know

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,360
but once again not a helpful answer

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,920
so i answered it for you again so

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
basically

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
it's like project management there's

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,239
just more of it

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,600
and it's at a little bit of a higher

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,720
level generally so it's more about

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,880
coordinating between

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,040
projects and activities sort of the

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,560
intersection the boundaries between

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,080
silos or not silos if you will

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
and it's less about involvement in the

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,040
specific details like you don't

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,479
necessarily care that on this day this

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,320
activity happens and let's say this

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,280
activity happens if it's all internal to

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
one team

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,120
basically you want to know when does

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,600
this thing affect the other parts

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,720
of the program except

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,440
turns out when your day job is

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,520
this thing and you're just paying a lot

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
of

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,960
volunteering yourself a lot so

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
even though my job is program manager

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,560
there are still some project manager

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,600
kind of things that i do sometimes

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,479
because it makes the overall program

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,759
successful

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,840
and there are things that are totally

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,560
outside the scope of my job that i do

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,639
like edit for fedora magazine or update

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
websites or all kinds of random things

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,840
that i sort of pick up here and there

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because nobody was doing them

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,840
and all of a sudden i'm doing them

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,479
responsibilities accumulate without

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,520
bound

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
all right so what is program management

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,199
right

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,199
that's why we're here

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
let's look at the constraints here we

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,600
have time

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,639
time is about managing schedules and

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
managing the schedule doesn't

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,520
mean you set the schedule so if you're

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,039
acting as the program manager

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,919
for your your program your open source

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
community your

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,600
project you don't necessarily want to

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,280
set the schedule but you're sort of in

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
charge of just knowing where we are in

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,880
the schedule and knowing where we're

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
supposed to be

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
and it very much does not mean being

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
held responsible for executing the

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,840
schedule

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
because there's only so much you can do

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
managing schedules is building out the

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,639
schedule communicating it

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,000
updating it and consulting on schedule

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,440
related decisions

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,360
so i talked about you know things being

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,080
interconnected and

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
uh one point i had a conversation with

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,759
fedor release engineering about oh can

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
we move this milestone a little bit

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,319
because it always conflicts with

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
our conference and i said yeah that

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,720
makes sense

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,560
here are like four different scenarios

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,919
that we could do and one of them

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
involved shortening

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,600
you know the time for beta testing one

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,720
short

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
you know shortened the amount of time

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
developers had to complete their work

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
and it turns out there's just a lot of

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
complexities when you move one point in

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
the schedule

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
because now you're affecting other

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,440
things that have to be done as

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,560
dependencies or as

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,560
downstream activities

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,400
and being the one who manages and

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
wrangles the schedule

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
puts you in an ideal position to be able

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,039
to speak on

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,039
the impacts of those things

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
so why would you even have a schedule

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
well users care

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,639
because they might want to know when

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,639
this new feature that you're working on

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
or this bug fix that's bothering them is

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
going to come out

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,120
they might want to time their upgrades

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
to you know make sure they have your

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,440
latest version before they do their

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,319
thing or whatever your downstream's care

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,919
so if you're you know writing a

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,639
programming language

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,080
the linux distributions that package it

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,120
up will probably want to know when it's

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,440
going to be available

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,639
desktop environment stuff like that if

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,000
you're

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,039
say a community developed uh

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,120
operating system and you have a

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,080
corporate enterprise operating system

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,879
that is

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
built from that they would like to know

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
when you're going to release and when

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,759
certain activities happen in your

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
schedule

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
your upstreams probably don't care but

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,280
they might

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
you're a major downstream for that

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,479
upstream if you're the reason that a lot

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
of people

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
if that's how they interact with your

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,599
software um they might want to make sure

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,960
that they have their release in time

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,639
release especially for linux

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
distributions like you know a desktop

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,560
environment

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
or a you know major uh package that you

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
know

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
provides some sort of user um interfaces

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
or

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
like database servers or things like

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,720
that things that people would want

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,640
in their distribution you want to be

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
able to not have to wait till the next

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,080
distribution rolls around

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,519
and there's a little bit of like how

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,440
else will you know it's done because

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
software will keep adding features

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
until it can read email and then it'll

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
keep doing more

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
and it'll slowly just take over the

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,920
whole world so if you have a schedule

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,720
you'd like ah yes the schedule says

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,720
we're done today

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
so there are a couple different types of

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
schedules these are very broad brushes

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,920
here

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,519
but there is the calendar based schedule

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,000
like fedora uses

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,720
there is a feature based schedule which

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,560
is basically

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
we'll release when we get this this this

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,279
and this done

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,959
and there's sort of a it's done i guess

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,800
uh model which you know isn't

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,640
necessarily super helpful but for small

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
projects especially with a development

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,839
team of one

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,640
that's probably fine you could do worse

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,000
so calendar-based schedules to build

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
those out you start with the target

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
release date and you work backwards

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
so if you say we want to release on

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,360
february 30th

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
here's all the activities we need to do

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
to get up to a release and how long

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,760
those take

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,560
and you find out you need to start work

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,839
three months ago you say uh oh

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
you probably have planned a little head

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
a little better than that

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,959
so how do you pick that that target

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,560
release date

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,920
well you might have upstream or

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,959
downstream release dates that are

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,480
important

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,680
so you look at those schedules and say

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,120
all right well we need to have this done

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,360
by then so we can

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,920
incorporate that or our stuff can be

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,279
incorporated into that release

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,279
you might just have tradition you know

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,560
we've always released on

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,200
january 32nd so we'll release on january

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,880
32nd this time too

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
you might have conferences or events

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,600
that are important to the ecosystem

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,200
you're in

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
and you'd really like to be able to get

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,800
up on stage doing your keynote

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,560
and talk about this great thing that

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,720
you've just added and it's available go

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,320
download it now

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
but it has to be like available to

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
download so you want to have it done by

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
then

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,959
there might be some fun dates so like if

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
you're developing stuff around raspberry

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
pi

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,519
pi day is a very you know popular day

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
because it's pi day it's like writing

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,680
the name right

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
or you might just say well you know

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
in eight months we typically have

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,040
something that's different enough

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,160
that we feel justified in calling it a

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
new release

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,880
so we'll just release every eight months

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,160
because that sounds nicer we'll do it

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,519
once a year because

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,279
by the time a year rolls around things

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,720
will be different enough and that's a

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,720
new release then that's fine

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,600
you can also do feature based schedules

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,360
it's with that you start with your

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
target feature set and you work forward

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
you say

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,240
here's the list of the things we want to

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,279
do how long will it take us to do that

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,000
okay so how do you pick the feature set

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,760
well how different do you want the next

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
release to be

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,000
what justifies a new release if you fix

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,800
one bug whereas like you had a comma in

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,160
the wrong place

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,360
in a gui menu is that justify any

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,480
release

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,760
probably not if you've rewritten

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,279
everything in a whole new language and

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
everything's brand new from scratch

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
yeah that probably justifies a new

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,760
release so then you think about

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,320
how interdependent are your changes if

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
you change

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,920
a do you depend on b c and d

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,399
to also get changed for things to work

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
all right that should all go together

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
if everything's just sort of independent

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,760
and modularized and microservices and

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,720
all that cool stuff that the kids say

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,160
these days

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,920
they just kind of pick some because you

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,959
might say well

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
we don't really want to make it a

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,160
calendar-based release but we also don't

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
want to wait seven years until our next

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,519
one

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,440
because you can't avoid the calendar

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,040
sorry even with feature-based releases

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,279
calendars still exist

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,720
and then you can have the it's done i

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,839
guess schedules where you just wake up

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,880
one morning like

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,440
it's release day i've decided and

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,240
like the the command line twitter client

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
that i

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,079
supposedly still maintain that's

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,760
basically how releases work

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,120
i'll sit i'll have some time i'll sit

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,480
down and get a few things done

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,959
and then i'm like all right well i don't

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,040
see myself doing anything for

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,399
hey it's a release now and that's fine

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,680
if that's what works for you and what

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,680
works for your user community

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,880
so here's some things you want to

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,320
consider about as you develop a release

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,720
schedule

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,480
you think about what milestones you need

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,360
are there deadlines for proposing

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,760
features or having code complete

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,800
do you have merge windows or branch days

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,360
where you you know

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,639
bring in the changes into the main trunk

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
or you take the

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,720
existing branch and you branch off this

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
release so that you can

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,000
continue doing forward development in

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,639
the main branch

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,839
or however you do it if you want to have

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,600
testing windows where you basically have

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,440
a freeze and you say the only thing that

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,120
gets in or fixes for these bugs we find

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,639
do you want to have certain releases

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,079
like you know alpha and beta or do you

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,560
want to go straight to ga

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,240
how far apart should those be stuff like

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,200
that

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
you want to think about conflicts so uh

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,040
interesting quirk

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,760
of the fedora schedule is that it turns

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
out

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,959
that the mass rebuild always starts

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,199
around

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,959
um for the odd-numbered releases

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,639
it starts around flock which is our

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,600
annual contribute fedora contributor

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,199
conference

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,160
and for the even number of releases that

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,600
starts around devconf check

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,760
that's a sort of an accident of the

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,839
schedule and it turns out that

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,800
moving that things around just became a

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,160
bit of a problem

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,639
for other reasons but you want to be

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
aware

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,680
of if there are conferences that are

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
relevant to your

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
community that you maybe don't try and

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,160
get a whole bunch of stuff done

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
uh during or right after if people are

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
traveling back

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,839
as you know conferences used to be like

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
back in the day

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,560
holidays are important to think about

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,079
but holidays are really interesting

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,360
especially when you have a mix of paid

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,760
contributors and volunteer contributors

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,920
because your paid contributors will

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,560
often go off and do something else

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,399
on holidays because they're not there to

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,680
work anymore

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,079
your volunteer contributors might

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,839
actually show up and be doing more stuff

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,720
because they're not at work so they have

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,240
time to work on their hobbies

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
your paid contributors sometimes are

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,279
also volunteer contributors so they may

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,199
just keep working the same no matter

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,959
what happens

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,519
so it's interesting you look at like the

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,800
fedora activity you can see a remarkable

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,680
drop in activity the last week of

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
december

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,519
red hat has a holiday shut down and

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
people who aren't working for red hat

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,880
are also doing things like traveling to

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,079
visit family or just spending time with

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,639
family

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,639
and some people are doing stuff to

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,160
escape their family whatever

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,639
but for the most part especially with

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,760
uh you know international communities

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
there's almost

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,120
always a holiday somewhere going on and

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,639
so things just kind of smooth out

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
but you want to be sure that if there's

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,040
you know if you have a really strong

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,199
uh contributor core in a certain region

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,040
and there's a major holiday then

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,279
don't plan on having a lot of activity

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,440
for that

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
um you also want to think about schedule

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,959
changes so

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560
if you move one date others get impacted

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,480
you're either shortening

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,680
a window until the next milestone which

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,279
might be important

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,120
or you're lengthening one or you're

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,120
moving up a deadline

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,880
and again this is not a thing where you

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,959
can't do that but you want to be

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,839
considerate of what that actually means

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,320
for your

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,839
development cycle and here's a fun one

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,000
public perception is something to

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,000
consider when developing a schedule

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,480
because not all one-week slips are

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
created equal

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,639
the marketing and the public perception

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,519
matters whether you like it or not

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,160
and so using fedora as an example again

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,839
um

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,000
a while back we decided that we was

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,880
going to basically use the same cookie

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,399
cutter schedule release after release

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,160
because it all basically looks the same

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,440
anyway so why bother going through the

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,959
whole approval process

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
every six months when it's going to be

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,360
the same thing

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
but as part of that what i did was i

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,240
decided that the

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,040
third tuesday of april and october would

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,639
be our target release dates

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,639
because that made our alternate target

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,279
the fourth tuesday

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,480
and you're like okay if we moved it back

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,720
one week to work

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,480
alternate target or you know initial

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,040
target was the fourth

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,720
tuesday then all of a sudden that one

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,600
week slip moves into

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,280
may or november and

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
historically fedora has had some

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,600
problems shipping on time

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,720
my predecessor's last release was our

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,679
first one

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,679
where we shipped on time and we haven't

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,280
broken that since

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
knock on wood but

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,760
you know we have unfairly now a

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,360
reputation

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,440
for being late and so if we can

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,360
slip one week and still have it be in

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
the same month that sounds a lot better

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,679
to people and it's

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,000
less public perception that's reality

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,000
folks

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,280
so what to do when your schedule is

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,200
wrong

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,039
well if it's calendar based you can cut

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,799
your troublesome features

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,200
or you can slip the release date

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,520
if it's feature based you can again cut

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,080
your troublesome features

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
and if it's mad it's done i guess then

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,720
the schedule is always right because it

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,080
doesn't exist you just wake up one

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,080
morning and decide it's release day

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,640
but what you say if i was too

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
pessimistic

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,799
and i will tell you to stop lying to me

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,480
because you're never too pessimistic

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,320
in that case you can release early you

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,320
can add more stuff you can just relax

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
you can do more testing

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,799
realistically it's not a problem that

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,160
comes up very often

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,160
all right so let's talk about cost

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,679
cost is people community projects don't

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
really have a budget

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,080
necessarily they don't have a lot of

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,320
dollar costs i mean there are

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,200
costs in keeping things going but you

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,799
know it's not like you're

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,679
losing out on revenue or whatever

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,400
but people their time is valuable

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,240
whether

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
they're doing this on their own time or

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,600
somebody's paying them to do it like you

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,440
want to respect the time they put into

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,440
it

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,799
ah but you don't have control over the

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,960
people do you

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,120
hmm so your job as the program manager

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,760
is to help the people coordinate

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,280
and make sure that we're not running

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,760
behind because we weren't talking to

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,600
each other

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,880
so communication is key and you'll see

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,559
this word a lot more

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,080
in the rest of the talk there's so much

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,720
information out there especially in a

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,640
large project say the size of fedora

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,480
so much going on on a variety of

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,320
different mailing lists

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,720
so distilling things into highlights

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
helps

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,760
meetings meetings meetings meetings

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,720
meetings meetings

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,000
it turns out meetings can be good not

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,160
necessarily fun but the

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,160
productive and they advance you know

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,200
work

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,640
you can do them via text via

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
phone video whatever works think about

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,320
what

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,840
works for your community though

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,679
because in some places people don't have

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,919
the bandwidth available

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,919
to not connect to a video meeting and

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,080
have it be reliable

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,600
people might not be comfortable if you

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,480
know if your project

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,080
runs on english and people you know who

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
are english as a second language or

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
third or fourth

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,720
fifth you know non-native english

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320
speakers it might not be comfortable

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,120
with their spoken english but they might

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
be better written

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,840
but no matter what format you use you

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,360
want to take notes

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,039
that's one thing i really like about irc

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,400
meetings is there's a bot that takes

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,080
notes for me i just give it a couple

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,799
commands and it does all its thing it

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,240
sends out an email it's great

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,360
but you also want to make sure you have

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,120
an agenda and that you stick to it

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,400
it should be clear why you're bothering

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,880
to have the meeting

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,120
and keeping people on track can be hard

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,039
but it's important because sometimes

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,320
things will just go on forever and ever

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,320
because some people like to talk

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,720
the other thing too is to you know don't

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,120
let decisions

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,799
or don't let meetings be the only place

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
decisions get made

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,640
because not everyone can attend your

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,600
meeting some people have to work some

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,960
people are asleep

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,440
some people don't have the bandwidth to

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,880
join you know

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,120
decisions are best when they're made

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,159
asynchronously and you want to make your

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,360
synchronous

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,640
meetings um as

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,000
accessible as possible to your community

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,520
but you don't want to shut people out of

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,320
decision making process because they

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,360
can't join the meeting

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,679
so speaking of channels um i'm a really

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
big fan of having one asynchronous tool

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
and one synchronous tool so a

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,080
synchronous tool like a chat

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,200
like irc or telegram or

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,960
whatever chat system you want to use

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,880
and then one asynchronous tool so a

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
mailing list or a discussion forum but

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,000
not both

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,919
because you really don't want to be

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
splitting the conversation well we

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,120
talked about that in telegram and that

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,320
in irc and that on matrix

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,400
and that was on the mailing list but

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,000
that was in the discussion forum

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,840
it's hard to keep up and yeah you can

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,120
bridge those things together

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,760
and maybe that's a solution for your uh

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,640
for your community but really having a

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,320
single place say

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,039
this is where we communicate is uh

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,679
going to make life easier for people you

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,120
want to keep the barrier to entry low

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,720
no matter what tool you use it's good to

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,679
have archives those are usually your

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,039
friend

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,480
there are times when you need to have

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,000
private conversations that aren't

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
archived but the

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,159
the default should be we're logging this

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,080
and it's going to be available later

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,520
because not only is that helpful for

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,440
people who want to learn more about your

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,480
community to see how it works or to

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,559
you know people who are going to write

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,640
news articles about your releases or

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,640
something that can see what's going on

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,240
but it's also really helpful to you

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
because i can't i've lost

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,200
track of the number of times i've had to

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,720
go back and look at an email thread from

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,880
six months ago like oh yeah that's why

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,039
we decided to do that okay i can do this

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,039
then

00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,919
the other thing that's really important

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,679
i talked about there being a lot of

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,919
information out there

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,960
so moderating a channel for important

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,480
messages

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,799
is important you want something where

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
the assumption is everyone's going to

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,760
subscribe to this

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,679
and if it comes out on this channel we

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,000
expect you to read it

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,440
the the other side of that coin is only

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,280
the really important stuff is going to

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,400
get through here

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,000
and it's going to be low volume

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
so for fedora we have a development

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,760
mailing list where lots of discussion

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,280
happens on a variety of things

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,280
and we have an announced mailing list

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
where every message has to be approved

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,799
so

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,640
accidental replies those go away

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,080
basically only things are like big

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,279
important announcements you must pay

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,200
attention to this

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,880
goes through there that allows people

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,960
who don't want the deluge

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,720
of all the messages to still still see

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,919
the important announcements

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,520
so let's talk about scope and scope is

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,320
really like managing your changes or

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,919
your features

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,520
or whatever you want to call them i'm

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,480
going to use the word change here mostly

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,240
because that's

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,600
the process we have in fedora we used to

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,000
have a features process the changes

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
process

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,200
replaced that it's better i've given a

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,360
talk about that talk to me about it

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,559
later

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,640
so why have it communication receiving

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,200
feedback and then more communication

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,880
like i said this word comes up a lot

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,640
now the process is going to vary by the

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,320
size and when i say size here i'm not

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,159
talking about lines of code that's

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,840
the number of contributors who are

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,120
participating

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,159
so you want the weight to be

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,080
proportional to the size

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,000
because what happens is the number of

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,480
communication channels the connections

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,799
between

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,120
individuals is exponentially related to

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,400
the number of people

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,559
doubling the size of a

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,080
group more than doubles the amount of

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,080
communication lines between them

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,919
so if you look at this graph

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,520
you have really big project with a

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,279
relatively heavy weight process like

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,440
fedoras

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,480
my command line twitter client has an

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
effective

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,400
development community of zero but really

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159
but one

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,320
and so it has a very lightweight process

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,919
which is basically ben did a thing

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,559
okay your project probably fits

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,840
somewhere

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,120
along that axis and so you when you

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
think about it think about what's

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,799
appropriate

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,080
for your community for the the volume of

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,080
people and the work you're doing

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,000
so if you're developing this kind of

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,080
process what do you want to think about

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,080
um who should validate the change check

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,440
it out to make sure it's reasonable

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,360
does release engineering you'd be like

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,360
yep we can do this

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,440
do you have a legal person who's like

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,919
yep that license is good no we can't do

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
that we're going to get sued

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,520
do you put it in front of the community

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
for a general review who defines what

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,799
the community is

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,240
how do they review it and then

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,760
separately

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,159
this is important who approves the

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,640
change because people can have input

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,600
without

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,039
actually being allowed to vote on it so

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,080
you could put it up to a community vote

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,080
where everyone gets to say

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,159
yes or no and you take a majority vote

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,880
or you have two thirds majority

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,799
or whatever you can have some sort of

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,360
technical steering body

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,440
who is a small group of people that

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,520
makes these kinds of decisions

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,120
you can have a single project leader who

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,960
you know speaks with authority on all

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,039
things and they decide

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,799
on their own what goes in and what stays

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,120
out

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,159
so my opinion and again this is probably

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,679
colored by

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,240
this being what fedora does

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,200
democracy is really messy we may have

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,360
learned over the years

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
and some people will only show up to

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,480
complain

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,760
but then not actually make contributions

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
to your community

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,039
and maybe that's okay with you maybe

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,320
it's not

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:54,080
um but if you want to get decisions made

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,840
in a reasonable-ish time frame

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,000
having an elected technical body to

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,559
approve the changes is a good approach

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,919
uh assuming your project is you know big

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,679
enough to justify it

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,279
if there's three of you youtube e3 can

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,279
argue it out

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,200
if there's 300 you might want to have a

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,520
few people who get elected every few

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,320
months or every year or whatever

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,880
and they are the ones that votes on

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,720
things

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,320
because then you still and the elected

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
party's important

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,279
because that still gives the community a

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,880
vote it becomes a representative

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,480
democracy instead of a straight

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
democracy

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,440
and if people don't if your community

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,440
doesn't like the direction that the

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,320
technical body is taking it

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,320
they can vote them out

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,559
you don't have to do it like this way

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,559
just my opinion

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,919
again so some considerations you want to

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,520
think about here

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,279
is what happens if changes can flip if

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,799
you and i both say i want to do this

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,120
thing but these things

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,080
are mutually exclusive who decides what

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,720
goes forward

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,159
or how that gets resolved what happens

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,399
if i make a change and it breaks

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,520
something which would never happen

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,039
but if it did you know who decides

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,440
what to do about it who has the

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,720
authority to back it out

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,159
and what happens if changes are

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
undelivered if i said yep i'm going to

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,880
do this thing and then i

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,760
go off to the beach and disappear and

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,760
never actually do it

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,720
quality tests are good it's good to have

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,600
tests

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,120
preferably automated because that people

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,919
are expensive we went back to you know

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,120
people have

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,640
cost but you know manual testing is

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,919
important for some things and

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,679
whatever but more than that you want to

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,559
have some release criteria you want to

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,200
have

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,520
you know we must be able to do this this

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,320
and this and this thing may not happen

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,440
in order to release it so you may have a

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,000
criteria that says

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,840
when the user upgrades it will not

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,919
remove all the data on their system and

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,799
turn their computer into a giant molten

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,799
pile of metal

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,679
people will appreciate that and having

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,919
release criteria can be helpful

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,039
for building trust with your users

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,720
because

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,399
they know that you've done at least some

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,559
degree of validation

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,600
but it's also important to consider that

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,120
not every bug

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,120
can block the release because otherwise

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,960
you will never release

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,200
so you do want to have some way to sort

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,960
of triage these important but not enough

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,960
important enough to block bugs

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,080
and maybe prioritize getting those fixed

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,080
first after the release

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
all right so how do you do all this

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,120
program management stuff that i've been

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
talking about and there's a lot more

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
that

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,559
isn't covered because i only have so

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,279
much time

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
to cover a whole lot of different things

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,320
but

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
for time being how do we do this

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,520
communicate

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,000
communicate communicate that's

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,559
the core of my job i send email i

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,520
receive

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,200
email i publish blog posts i review blog

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,320
posts

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,000
i attend meetings um

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,559
one of the first things i did when i

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,399
uh became the thrower program manager so

00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,840
i made a list of all the meetings that

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,440
are going on and tried to make it to

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,279
almost all of them

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,039
at least once just wave my hand say hi

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,679
i'm here i'm paying attention

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,840
i know you exist come to me if you need

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,840
help

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,799
and i'm on a lot of mailing lists where

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,960
i don't actually have any intention of

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,399
ever doing anything in that part of the

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,159
community just because there's only so

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,440
much i can do or i just don't have the

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,039
skills for that

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,600
but it's still important for me to know

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,679
what's going on and to be able to

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,520
spot issues and try and help people out

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
so there's a lot of listening that goes

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,320
in there's also a lot of

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,080
talking outward communication so i do a

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,360
weekly blog post where i say here's all

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,120
the stuff that's happened this week

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,960
at sort of a high level you know here

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,720
are the changes that were submitted and

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,399
here's some upcoming important meetings

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,159
and conference deadlines and

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,399
scheduled milestones and all that stuff

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,760
i have regular office hours which people

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,200
almost never attend

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,039
but that's okay because sometimes they

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,960
do when we talk about things and the

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,799
rest of time

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,080
i'm there if they need me but it's

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,960
important to be

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,960
available and visible to the community

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,880
and then also public issue trackers or

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,080
kanban boards or something

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,360
so that people can see what you're

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,120
working on and they have a way of

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,640
letting you know hey something's broken

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,640
i need help with this thing or whatever

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,720
so most of the things i've talked about

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,320
here

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,799
are just program management in general

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,080
whether it's corporate programs or

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,760
community programs

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,760
so how is it different in communities

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,880
well like in companies people don't

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,559
really appreciate

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,840
process and bureaucracy for the most

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,159
part they want us to be able to do their

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,360
stuff

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,279
not to worry about making sure they

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,840
checked all the boxes and do things and

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,840
blah blah blah

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,039
also liking companies you might have

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,279
having direct authority over the people

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,720
who are working on stuff

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,320
and the job is really all about

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,240
communication and coordination

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,440
so here's what's different in

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,600
communities

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,519
you can really only lead by influence so

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,120
it took me about six months before i was

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,760
comfortable saying no

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,640
go go redo that because that's not what

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,279
you need to do for this process

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,480
before that i was like yeah i'll fix

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,000
that up for you before i send it along

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,679
it's fine

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
and that's because it takes time to

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,960
build credibility and even though i've

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,039
been a contributor to fedora for a long

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,640
time i was sort of off on the side a lot

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,840
i wasn't necessarily very visible and

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,360
people aren't going to listen to you

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,960
just because you have a title you need

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,559
to establish that

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,240
yes you know what you're talking about

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,320
and you're going to be helpful

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,679
and you're here to make things better

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,640
you have to show the community your

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,480
value

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,760
because you can't go complain to

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
somebody's manager when they're not

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
doing

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,279
the thing because there's not a manager

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,480
for them to complain to

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,960
because they're doing this in their

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,279
spare time

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,360
so the most important thing to remember

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,519
if you take away nothing else

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,320
is that whatever process you develop the

00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,240
process is here to serve the community

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,480
the community is not here to serve the

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,159
process and if you find yourself

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,080
trying to adjust the community to serve

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,840
your process that means your process is

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,960
wrong

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,720
and so with that we are out of time so i

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,399
will stick around for your questions and

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,240
i appreciate your attention

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,480
once again if you have nice things to

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,000
say there's my twitter handle

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,679
if you have not nice things to say you

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,559
are cordially invited to keep those to

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,840
yourself

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,840
thank you very much

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,000
thank you so much ben for an amazing

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,159
presentation

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,840
and now we would like to have some

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,840
questions if there are any

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,720
and if you have a question and don't

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:14,159
feel like typing uh feel free to

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,159
request to join with audio and video

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,839
so neil asked what was the hardest thing

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,960
for you when you started being a program

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,480
manager

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,440
i think for me it was

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,879
knowing all the connections uh you know

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,159
fedora

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,839
is a huge community

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,359
a lot of people have been around for a

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,040
long time and you know

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,399
so even though i've been contributing

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,159
and there are a lot of names i'd

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,520
recognize over the

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,879
10-ish years that i had been a volunteer

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
um there were a lot of parts of the

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,240
project that i just hadn't touched yet

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,639
and so learning all those connections

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,960
and trying to

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,800
understand them and you know insert

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,920
myself where appropriate without getting

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,119
in the way

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,119
was really hard uh karsten asked

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,320
do you network with other program

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,320
managers who work on

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,480
other open source projects both inside

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,000
and outside of red hat

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,359
so i uh from an hr perspective i'm on

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,680
the team

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,599
at red hat that does all of the program

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,880
management for

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,280
rel specifically so not any of the

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,800
things layered on top of it but just the

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,040
various red hat enterprise linux

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,960
distributions

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,160
one of the things i've really wanted to

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,720
do

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,720
um and i just haven't done yet because

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,599
it's a big undertaking and there's

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,800
only so much time in the day is to sort

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,839
of put together

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,839
a an informal group of people who are

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,079
doing similar roles in other uh

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,040
community driven uh operating system

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,680
distributions

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,040
or other you know very large projects

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,440
and sort of build a community of

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,599
practice i guess around that

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,320
um because there are a lot of things i

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,640
think we can learn from each other

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,640
but if there is one of those it's very

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,839
secretive and hard to find

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,000
so um i would have to

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,280
start it or talk somebody else into

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,040
starting it

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,320
um but i think you know like i said in

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
the talk

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,920
even if you don't have the program

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,200
manager title and even if the

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,280
functions aren't done by one person

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,560
the work is being done somewhere in the

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,839
project

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,599
so it's uh it you know it's good to

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,760
build that knowledge especially

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,960
for people who don't have the benefit of

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,000
having sort of a formalized role i think

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,920
there's a lot of things that you just

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,680
sort of start doing because you realize

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,320
it needs doing

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,359
but you don't get the benefit of you

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,839
know the interaction

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,520
and some of the historical knowledge

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,800
that gets handed down

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,800
from like for example from my

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
predecessors

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,560
yes uh i'd definitely be happy to talk

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:23,839
to you later about bringing that into

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:25,280
the open source way

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,160
or talking to you about it now if there

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,160
are no other questions

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,640
hi friend hi there wow apparently i can

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,440
just make myself join

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,240
cool um yeah that just if i don't want

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,760
to take over

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,359
you know other things but but i hadn't

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,119
even thought about this and necessarily

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,640
until you said it and i was like oh yes

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,160
that's like that's community practice

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,640
stuff and i don't know

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,359
um i do we have other people we know i

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,359
mean um

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,960
um amy scavarda comes to mind right away

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,320
who's the experienced program manager in

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,839
another organization there's a lot of

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,800
people out there doing very

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,440
similar kinds of things so you know i

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,119
don't know if we'd

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:12,400
be happy to facilitate that or probably

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,280
jesus hi neil hey neil yeah i think

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,560
that'd be good because like you know

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,400
i certainly

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,920
my role and i think

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,079
fairly broadly across red hat i'm

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,160
maybe the only person whose full-time

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,040
job is being a program manager in an

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,480
upstream community uh you know we did

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,079
we have people working in like community

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,880
architect roles who you know they do

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,800
some of this work

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,320
we have people involved in other

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,040
upstreams in different ways but i don't

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,079
know that we've

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,560
formalized any other upstream role like

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,359
this

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,880
anywhere in the projects that red hat's

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,680
involved with so i was actually just

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,040
literally

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,760
about that because you know you know my

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,000
experience

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,520
operating in so many different

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,880
communities is that i think you're

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:05,599
actually one of a kind

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:08,640
like uh so for those who may not know

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,000
i actually operate in lots of

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:16,079
linux and operating system communities

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,280
and ben's particular role is unique

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,440
to to the governance of fedora

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,400
because in other linux distribution

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,359
communities even

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,200
large semi-corporate backed ones or

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,760
fully corporate-backed ones

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,640
there isn't an equivalent position held

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,160
by anybody

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:38,079
in opensuse community manager

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,920
project owner and uh

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,440
director whatever you want to call it

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,079
like these all these little functions

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,320
that

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,440
that in fedora are split up across four

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,640
different people

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,680
one person and then there's

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,520
in ubuntu where they have the community

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,880
council thing which has been um

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,040
i don't know if you saw recent news uh

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,560
it's not much of one at the moment but

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,160
hopefully it will be again

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,000
but like that was an all-volunteer

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,040
position that

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,280
operated um that function

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,319
of the of of the ubuntu community and

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,920
debian

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,560
being a um essentially owned by a

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,400
charity

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,119
right spi owns them that's how they

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,960
operate they don't have

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,480
and their culture does not permit them

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,359
to have such a role

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,359
at all they don't have a way for people

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,640
to coordinate at scale in the same way

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,720
that you do

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,079
but what is interesting though is that

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,319
you're right people who don't

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,359
necessarily have that title

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,160
wind up doing it anyway right it just

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,760
shows up

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,000
because it kind of needs to be done so

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,960
i wonder one thing that i wanted to ask

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,079
and it just didn't

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,839
it was too slow to type was

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,400
have you tried reaching out to the other

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,079
community to see who those people are

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,240
and to see what is similar and what is

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,240
different between the formal program

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,560
manager and the informal

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,960
like it kind of just happened program

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,440
manager type

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,560
not really that's you know that's kind

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,119
of part of what i what i was talking

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,280
about like

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,800
wanting to do is you know seeing what

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,599
other communities are doing and how they

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,920
do it

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,119
um i've talked to lubosh a little bit at

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,839
opensusa

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,240
um and like we've compared notes on a

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,680
few

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,160
things a few times but you know there's

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,839
not really like a

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,200
like i'd love to start a mailing list of

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,079
you know people who do these sorts of

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,440
things and just

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,359
you know get together every once in a

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,040
while and and talk about the things we

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,520
do in our jobs

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,359
um but it's kind of hard it can be hard

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,640
especially from outside the community to

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,319
try and figure out

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,839
who are the people in that community

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,560
doing the job

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,920
especially um when it's split across you

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,079
know three or four different people

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,599
doing the same thing that that i'm doing

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,119
right but at the least if you start

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,400
gathering practices together and start

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,000
gathering people who are doing parts of

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,880
those jobs this is just because that's

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
kind of

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,280
yeah that's what happens with open

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,720
source where people take take on

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,240
multiple roles well

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,760
um and to some degrees you might because

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,200
i remember how this real world started

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,400
in fedor it started because somebody

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,079
started to pull the practice together

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,640
and was doing the job

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,640
sort of not exactly formally but wanted

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,319
to get it that wanted to kind of un

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,920
untangle those bits from the product

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,280
from the project lead

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,440
who was having to do all that stuff too

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,040
and then that untangling to find a role

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,760
for themselves that move forward and so

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,280
this is

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,119
other people can do this if we give the

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,440
people those untanglings to some degree

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,640
so

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,040
and i think there's a question about

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,640
david and cat though so yes that's true

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,000
too i think there's a question for david

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,400
and chad i don't want us to take over

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,920
from

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,119
so he said he said he finds one of the

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,640
big issues that come up here is that of

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,920
not having influence in places where you

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,440
have responsibility

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,319
how do you identify and track that in a

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,319
way that makes sense

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,680
that's a hard one um you know i

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,400
influence there are places i don't have

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,599
influence

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,160
and you know i try

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,240
um sometimes you just have to be very

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,200
patient over months or years to build

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,720
that

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,920
a lot of it is volunteering to do things

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,839
that you hate doing

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,040
because somebody else hates it and like

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,720
you know what i'll take this work off

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,640
your plate for a little bit

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,079
and you can focus on that other thing um

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,760
and you know it's very much like an

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,800
exchange of favors kind of thing

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,359
um you know i think a good program

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,400
manager

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,079
is always owed a few debts by everyone

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,640
um because then you can call those in at

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,640
some point

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,119
um and you know some of it is just being

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,800
sometimes you have to stand up and

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,240
assert yourself even if you know you're

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,760
going to get ignored

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,800
uh and then you go back and say you know

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,839
like i did it i did what i could

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,280
um it is helpful within

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,880
you know within fedora that there are a

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,280
lot of people who work at red hat

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,280
um and are working on fedora at least in

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,880
part on their day job because those

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,880
like in those cases i can't escalate

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,960
things to managers especially when it's

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,400
you know release criticals i can go to

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,800
them and say

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,440
hey i need help and it's not it's very

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,520
rarely uh hey your person is a screw-up

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,800
it's more of a hey this is a big

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,960
priority can you

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,000
re reallocate their time a little bit

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,440
for another week or two

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,200
um and you know one thing that my

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,960
manager made very clear during the

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,640
interview process and when i first got

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,720
came on board was

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,079
i'm not going to be held responsible for

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,440
the timing of

00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:29,280
fedora releases because like i could do

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,480
my job poorly and things will kind of

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,800
fall apart a little bit

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,079
like we'll still manage but it may maybe

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,720
won't run a smooth

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,480
but there's nothing that i can do if

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,200
everything else is falling like i cannot

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,960
fix

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:47,119
you know the the process uh like more

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,119
generally um and so

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,240
um i think sometimes you have to be

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,079
willing to accept that

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,760
you've done your best and everything

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,520
still went wrong

00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,640
um and it looks like uh

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,520
we're closing in a few minutes

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,119
so um yeah you can go for a few months

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:19,280
more if you want

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:20,880
okay okay uh are there other questions

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,640
and if you want to continue the

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,880
conversation we also have breakout rooms

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,720
under the expo tab i just linked it

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,040
in the chat so feel free to head there

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
