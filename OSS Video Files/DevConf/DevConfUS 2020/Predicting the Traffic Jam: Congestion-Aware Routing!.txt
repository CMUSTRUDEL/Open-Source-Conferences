	Speaker: Niharika Shrivastava

What if there existed no traffic congestion for anyone at all times? What if you knew that by walking for a couple minutes more to the next nearest bus station, you could save more travelling time overall? In this session, we propose a framework that provides congestion-aware routes to an entire network system by estimating future traffic flow. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework by using Singaporeâ€™s network data from OpenStreetMap coupled with its real-time traffic data. The project is built entirely using only open source tools. This should inspire attendees into intelligent urban mobility, robotics, and AI.
