Title: Metadata Strategy for Beautiful Nerds
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Anna McHugh

Good metadata makes good information easy to find, but 35% of B2B content is never used. Folks who engage with your content deserve care and respect—and metadata empowers them to find what they need. Embrace your inner beautiful nerd and learn methods for connecting people with authoritative, trustworthy, and meaningful knowledge.
You’ll learn how to:
- Audit and analyze your content and tools without spending the rest of your life in a spreadsheet.
- Build metadata and search systems that support your organization’s purpose and expertise.
- Use the GitLab Remote Manifesto to build a knowledge ecosystem that works for people.
- Improve your software by incorporating the ideas (and workarounds) of passionate amateurs.
- Bridge developers and users by becoming a technologist, bug hunter, and expert on your own content collection.
- Develop software integrations that count, and focus people’s passion for ML/AI to build practical features.
- Conquer the world. Or at least content bloat.

all right folks for the next session

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:09,599
we are gonna have a talk on

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,480
metadata strategy for beautiful nads i

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,160
will

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,839

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
after the session

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
okay

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,399
let me know if you can see my screen

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,000
hi my name is anna mchugh and i am a

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,320
content librarian

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and curator at red hat which is one of

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
the world's first open source software

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
companies

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,559
today i'm going to talk about content

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,600
management systems

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,440
both for uh external web users and also

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,440
internal libraries that you may have at

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,920
your organization

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,000
my role as a librarian and curator at

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,960
red hat is to ensure that our content is

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,520
relevant

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,320
up to date labeled with meaningful

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,040
labels

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
and also is housed in software systems

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
where it can be found

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,240
and where you can emphasize the most

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,240
important information

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,520
i came to red hat about five years ago

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
and i am not a formerly

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,439
trained librarian although i have always

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,119
been a huge information nerd

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,280
i love hanging out in the stacks of

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,479
libraries finding that choice bit of

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,079
information that's hidden

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,320
all the way to the back and all the way

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,240
in the basement however as soon as i got

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,759
to red hat i realized that that kind of

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,799
inclination was simply not going to

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
serve me

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
i am responsible for the library on

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
redhat.com

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,360
and so that's a collection of documents

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
that is um

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,399
valuable to a wide variety of external

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,240
users so we have to do documentation

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,200
that is for developers

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,399
administrators we have documents that

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,000
are good for people who are just trying

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
to learn about what open source is and

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,079
how it functions in the world

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
when i came on board i realized that it

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,799
was very important for us to build

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,600
robust

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,840
and easily accessible metadata systems

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
and also to use that metadata to ensure

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,760
that search experiences

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,000
are easy for users and i'm going to tell

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,440
you how all of that went down

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,520
and i think that it's really important

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,720
however to note that you know

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,360
in this day and age it can seem that

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,800
uh you know our vast amount of

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,959
information is always an

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,280
asset there's definitely also an

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,440
inclination to hang on to every last

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,720
white paper every last case study that

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,080
you authored

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,959
however i think it's very important to

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,959
raise her in on the important

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
information and to establish context

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
throughout the entirety of one's

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
collection

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
to make sure that you're connecting

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,400
users not just with the totality of

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
information

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
but saying here this thing on the top

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,200
this is the most relevant the most

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
trustworthy

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,480
because given the rapid amount of uh you

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,360
know content that we create

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,159
and how rapidly also the subject matter

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
of that content

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,280
tends to evolve it's very very important

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,120
to be able to do that

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
additionally i think that is really

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
important in terms of

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
uh our move toward an all remote

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,360
workforce now red hat has always been

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
um anywhere between 30 and 40 percent uh

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
remote at least in the time that i've

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
been there

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,480
and so when um you know kova came and we

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,760
uh started to work remotely

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,920
we already had some really good

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,440
practices in place

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,360
that being said one of the things that

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
my team took a look at almost

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
immediately

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
um in terms of our new you know

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,920
supporting mission

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,920
uh is the uh get lab remote manifesto

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,159
and this is sort of an adjunct to the

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,840
agile manifesto which essentially

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,519
establishes a set of principles and

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,400
ideas where uh

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,959
teams that are interdisciplinary or

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,799
multi-disciplinary teams

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,400
can build products together in a rapid

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,560
and iterative fashion

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
now this is a very uh you know dynamic

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,799
way to work but you also need to have

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
excellent communication between team

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,080
members

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,959
and so you know very frequently a lot of

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
the practices

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,640
that develop around agile involve a lot

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
of meetings a lot of regular

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,959
communication of what is in your way

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
what kinds of changes the business has

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
given you that

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,840
changes the software changes the project

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,479
that you're creating

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,880
now in order to extend that git lab has

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,520
uh you know brought forth a couple of uh

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,080
really interesting sort of principles

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
that can

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
help agile teams also adapt to an all

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,639
remote environment

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,040
uh first of all and before anything else

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
includes inclusion and transparency are

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
paramount and i think that uh you know

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,960
the work that i do is really important

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,360
in establishing that because

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,479
transparency include and inclusion

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
really begins with

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,639
everyone having a certain understanding

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,759
of where information can be found

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
and what in a source of authority is

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
additionally good documentation is very

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,440
important you know you don't have the

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,240
opportunity to necessarily job shadow

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,800
somebody

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
if you're in a remote environment so

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
good documentation

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,759
not necessarily comprehensive

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
documentation but the documentation that

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,560
will help people get through their jobs

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,199
every single day

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
is super duper important and so i think

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
that uh you know

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,639
this is an area where uh we can really

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
flourish not only in terms of creating

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,880
documentation but ensuring that the

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,919
documentation that is the most important

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,759
again rises to the top finally

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,680
asynchronous communication

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,440
i think this is going to be one of the

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
ongoing challenges that

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,160
teams grapple with and cope with kind of

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,680
regardless of their circumstances

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
you know you have teams that are global

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,960
people working at all hours of day

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
or night as the earth turns we have

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,919
people with

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,440
a variety of differing needs as far as

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
their working styles

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
and it's very important to foster that

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,880
flexibility especially because you know

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
at the core of this

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,000
manifesto and agile is valuing the

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,880
humanity and valuing the collaboration

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
that comes out of

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,840
people who uh feel like they are valued

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,840
feel like they are empowered to create

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,520
change when it's necessary

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,199
so i think that the work that i do is

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,319
really critical in fostering all of

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,960
these things

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
and as a result of course i take it very

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
seriously

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,080
now i am not suggesting that everybody

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,440
who is a trained librarian should um you

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,120
know drop their books immediately and

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,720
run off and become a cis admin because

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,240
that would both be impractical

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,919
and probably not very good for the

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
overall quality of the assist admins

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,280
that are available for hire

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
now instead i think it's really

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,199
important for us to focus on what we're

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,919
good at which is creating good labels

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,880
but also becoming very familiar with our

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,560
tools

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
so you know one of the things that i

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,560
think is really instrumental in my job

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,560
is i serve as a sort of midway point

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
between the business stakeholders

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,919
so these are the people who are building

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
the website people who are building

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,360
technology products

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,319
that you know that we're trying to bring

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,919
to market and the developers and the it

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
operations folks who run our

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,280
infrastructure who

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
run our websites who build our content

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,599
management systems and other

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,039
systems of record so i very frequently

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,039
hear from people in the business who

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,160
have you know concrete concerns and

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,919
considerations

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,199
but they don't understand and shouldn't

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,919
have to understand

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,520
how uh the software works to explain

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,440
what kinds of features they want or what

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
problems they're experiencing

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,639
on the other side of the house the

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,639
developers don't necessarily know what

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,880
the business priorities are or

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,160
you know have necessarily the skills to

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
tease that out

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
now project managers can help but also

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,080
um again

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
somebody who understands the business

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,599
context

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,120
of the content but also the systems in

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,720
which it's housed and how those things

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,840
can be built and modified

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,000
is a really valuable thing so

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,160
uh you know very frequently when i'm

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,440
talking with people i think that there's

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,280
a lot of real interest in um and a lot

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
of very promising developments and the

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
level of sophistication that we

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,919
have search algorithms and uh you know

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,400
creating personalized experiences

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
a wide array of really interesting tools

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
to connect people with the knowledge

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,840
that they need

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,319
however there is a i think significant

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,039
role

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,919
uh at least at this point for human

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,560
decision making

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
and the ability of humans to discern the

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,919
uh

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,000
you know what is trustworthy what is

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,400
expert and what is authoritative

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,240
far better than machines at this point i

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,080
think that the uh recapture project is a

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
really good example of how

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
uh you know computers and software

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,039
systems

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,520
and also uh you know the human intellect

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,760
uh can work together to um you know

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,519
basically harvest and create more rich

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,839
textured information

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,200
so recaptcha essentially is just digital

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,440
scans of

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,560
you know books that haven't been

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,720
digitized

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,800
and then they're presented in a uh sort

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,880
of distorted fashion and users use them

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,959
to authenticate and to get into websites

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,880
demonstrate that they're not bots now

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,080
this information is fed back into this

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,320
massive digitization

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,160
project which really feeds uh you know

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,720
the growth of overall knowledge and

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,399
and serves a very important need i think

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,920
it's also a good illustration of one of

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,560
the things that human beings are very

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,399
good at

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,839
that machines aren't necessarily so good

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,640
at and that is looking at things and

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,600
interpreting

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
images especially um you know distorted

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,080
images

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:20,160
or for that matter um you know distorted

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,399
or uh symbolic or metaphorical speech

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
so the human mind is really good at

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,120
understanding that kind of information

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,800
and you know you can bake that into uh

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,760
the algorithms and the different tools

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,320
that you use

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
to essentially again build that context

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
build that understanding that you have

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,560
of value and what people are trying to

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,560
learn but also what you're trying to say

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,040
because you know no collection of

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,720
documents is actually fully objective

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
you are saying something especially if

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
you're talking about a website for a

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,519
company

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
now some people will you know

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,440
occasionally poo poo the role

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,240
of uh human beings in the organization

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,399
of such

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,560
uh collections of information and my

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,839
counter point to that would be that even

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
google understands

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,320
you know the value uh that human beings

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,839
bring to these sorts of complementary

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,880
activities building knowledge

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,279
environments

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,279
that take into account um some of the

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,480
more qualitative factors of the content

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,959
itself

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,399
so um you know one of the things that i

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,399
find to be fascinating

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
about google's work is that they have

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,200
quality rater guidelines

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,959
so basically it's a 168 page document

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
that is for human beings

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,640
and they sit down and they read a

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
website and they compare it against the

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,600
rubric of

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
different measures of what quality is

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,040
and how

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,160
uh you know again to assess and evaluate

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
how a website

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,560
uh behaves and performs and how

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,160
basically it should rank and search

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
and there are three main factors that

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,079
are very important that are also very

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,320
difficult for machines to discern

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,880
and i think these are also really the

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,640
three critical things that determine

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
whether or not information that we

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,360
encounter in digital environments is

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
valuable

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
expertise authoritativeness and

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,200
trustworthiness

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
so essentially the entire set of

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
activities that a

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
quality rater goes through is to

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,399
identify the

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
level to which a page represents those

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
things

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,040
this becomes increasingly important when

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,000
you're uh talking about

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,839
websites that potentially have a lot of

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,440
implications of using that information

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,880
so medical websites

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,880
financial services etc so all of the uh

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,240
you know human feedback is fed into the

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,560
google algorithm

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,920
so that there is a sort of a continual

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,360
um building of

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,000
an uh you know set of understandings of

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,000
where those fault lines are in terms of

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
what makes something authoritative what

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,240
makes a voice expertise

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
and more than anything else what is

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,959
trustworthy because that's the most

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,839
important thing that we're trying to

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,680
parse

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,519
on the internet or really anywhere

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,880
so stepping back from all that crazy

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,800
stuff i'm going to tell you the story

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,000
about how my job came to be

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,480
and uh how i came to um

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,839
you know spend the last five years at

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
red hat going from

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,079
a chaotic document library in a very

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,920
very disorganized content management

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,760
system hosted in drupal

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,760
to what i would like to think is a more

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
robust more flexible system that people

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,639
also have

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
access to data that is meaningful both

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,880
on the outside

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
and internal users so this is a quick

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,079
timeline we aren't actually dancing

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,720
bears at red hat although we do

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,120
occasionally have a as party animals

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,120
when i was hired in 2014 2015 we were

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,880
just uh moving on to

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,279
uh drupal from an earlier content

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,000
management system so the new redhat.com

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
had a

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,760
library that i essentially on my first

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,680
day inherited and i said my goodness

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,760
this is rather large and my boss

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,240
you know uh said well yes you know part

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,440
of your work is going to be sorting out

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,880
um you know what's good content and uh

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,839
what we need to get rid of

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
and i said well that should be

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,079
relatively easy we just pick a date

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and we archive things that are older

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,160
than that date more or less

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,079
and she said aha this is the difficulty

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,040
when we migrated our content

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,120
into drupal it put the same time and

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,639
date stamp on all of these things

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
this is a perfect example of the

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,320
unintended consequences of building cool

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,480
new stuff

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
but as a result of that it also became

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,800
very clear that our first order of

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
business

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,920
was going to be going through the

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
content and auditing it

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,279
making sure not just that we're getting

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
rid of the things that are no longer

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,760
relevant

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,000
but more importantly that we were

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,320
developing a strategic system for

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,920
managing and labeling that content and

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
future content so that we'd be able to

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,440
create a system that had a little bit of

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,120
coherency to it

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,120
so um you know 2014 2015 was

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,279
kind of getting my legs under me and you

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,800
know working on some of this auditing

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,120
uh 2016 additionally we spent a lot of

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,680
time not just auditing content but also

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,720
uh starting to work on our content

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,279
management system

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,199
itself and so developing a far more

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
sophisticated taxonomy

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,519
uh working to um you know develop

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,000
on-site search mechanisms

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,519
and also incorporate some of our organic

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,639
strategy

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,120
2017 and 2018 were characterized by

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,440
getting

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,440
additional access to data outside of the

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
content management system and marrying

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,160
it up

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,079
uh so you know the best example of this

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,720
is that we are able to create content

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,079
segments using our inventory and so say

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,639
for instance we could

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,639
gather a list of assets or a list of

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,880
white papers about

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,120
linux which is one of the primary things

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,440
that red hat is in the business of

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,560
and we could marry that up with the uh

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,040
data analytics

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,839
that are used to measure the performance

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,440
of content

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
this was really helpful to us because we

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,519
were able to understand what's working

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
what's not and also have an

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,560
understanding of what users are trying

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,959
to get to so that we make sure

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,000
that information is what we focus on in

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,040
terms of making sure

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
it's up to date um and then in you know

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,000
2018 and 2019

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
we started to also uh branch out into

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,560
some sort of

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,839
home group technical solution so we

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,519
could take these different sources of

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,199
data and bring them together

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,959
we also started to do it you know

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
started to do hacks and work around so

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,320
that we could use our taxonomy to do

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,279
some personalization and other

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,760
uh interesting activities and uh

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,079
additionally in 2019 2020

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,839
we uh built and launched a digital asset

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
management system as a software as a

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,560
service

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,160
uh so we're moving off of a far more

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
traditional sort of file management

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,639
platform

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,399
onto something that's available in the

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,920
web browser and we built the entire

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,839
search experience around that

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,440
and around the uh you know specific

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
collection we're trying to present to

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,600
people

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,279
so i'm just going to give you a quick

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,519
rundown of the main things that we

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
had to get done before we could make any

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,240
progress on a

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560
on the cool things like um you know

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,199
tying our performance data together

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,959
with our uh content and metadata uh

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,279
first of all we had to audit

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,160
audit audit that content and also look

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,399
at the metadata

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,680
not only you know what labels were on

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
things and ensuring

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
that uh you know we we cleaned up that

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,920
uh you know all of those records

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,519
but also making sure that the taxonomy

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,040
itself was in good shape

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,959
now if you're not familiar with the term

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
taxonomy i'm just gonna back out really

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,360
quick and explain it

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,880
more or less taxonomy is just classified

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,600
information

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,360
dad jokes aside essentially it is just a

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,279
um you know organizational system where

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,639
you have a hierarchy of information so

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,959
you have a parent level

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,800
uh you know a parent level category and

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,240
child terms underneath it

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,480
so in the case of uh red hat we have

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
uh topics is one of our parent level

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,399
categories

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120
we have linux we have cloud computing we

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,759
have

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,759
devops and security so you're basically

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,839
able to say okay this is a dimension of

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,639
the content this is a you know a label

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,720
that i want

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,639
and here is a controlled list of

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,959
selections that people have

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
now sometimes people feel you know users

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,759
could say well i'd love to

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
be able to use keywords because i can be

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,959
descriptive and

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
you know it'll be easier for people to

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,320
find the content if it's a very specific

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,759
bit of information

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,480
i find a controlled list of taxonomies

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,160
that are also

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,439
developed sort of strategically

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,079
alongside the business and the

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,880
collection

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,480
to be far more effective so you have to

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,439
you know audit your content audit your

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,640
metadata

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,000
you also have to ensure that that data

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,319
continues to be accessible and also has

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
high integrity so you know if you have

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,520
to pass the torch to a different person

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,919
who's going to become respon

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,360
responsible for publishing content uh

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,600
impressing upon them the

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,400
importance of uh good labeling and

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,480
tagging is critical

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
so when i first started at red hat we

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
had um again this idea that it's going

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,760
to be relatively easy to get me up to

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,960
speed and we're going to

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,039
you know um be able to sort of

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
smoothly transition to this new platform

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,880
where we were uh

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
hosting our um content so drupal

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
specifically

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,400
and uh it became very clear that we just

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,640
had a lot of different problems

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,160
um everything everything from you know

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,000
the records without

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,400
the time and date stamps on them uh to

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,280
you know information that was simply out

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,600
of date

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,320
and needed to be looked at by people who

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,799
are uh

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,640
technical you know owners of the content

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,120
people who are experts on red hat

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,440
products and open source technology

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,600
so over the course of the first year and

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,640
change that i was working at red hat uh

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,000
we eliminated nearly 2500 pdfs that were

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
either out of date

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,440
no longer relevant uh basically what you

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,320
would call content

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
rot which is let's see uh information

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,240
that is

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
redundant outdated and even worse than

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,160
everything else

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,400
trivial so that was the focus uh

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
and you know on an ongoing basis as a

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,720
practice we uh

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,320
quarterly will audit content and so our

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,080
method for doing this essentially is we

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,039
say anything that's older than a certain

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,919
amount so in our case 18 months

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,760
needs to be audited if it does not meet

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,000
certain performance benchmarks

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,960
so we need to ensure that the content is

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,120
um you know

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,720
actually of interest to people to again

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
get rid of the trivial things and

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
emphasize the things that are more

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,799
important to our users

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
uh but also to just give us a check of

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,520
like

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
18 months later is this still relevant

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,880
in the technology industry very

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,559
frequently we have to retire things far

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,039
before 18 months

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,679
so we have a window of time basically um

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,240
you know

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
three years to 18 months of age we look

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
at

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,960
the performance of the content itself

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,559
anything that's older than three years

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
someone has to scream and yell and

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,559
holler to not have us archive it

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,679
now occasionally we will have people who

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,600
are owners who are really good at

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,880
communicating like no this technology is

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,640
actually stable enough

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,760
or this is a product that some of our

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,320
users have that we need to keep around

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
that said auditing and auditing on an

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,600
ongoing basis is

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,520
really really important to us i will

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,360
attempt to use my slides in the correct

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,760
direction

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,120
so not just auditing content um you know

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
obviously that was one of the first

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,799
things that i really dug my teeth into

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,159
um but you know in the building and then

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,559
the maintenance of

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,679
uh the drupal system and then uh

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,799
subsequently our

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,440
internal digital asset manager um

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,919
we realized that access to data in a

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
very simple csv format was probably the

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,000
most valuable feature

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,760
that our developers delivered for us you

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,880
know you could have all of the wonderful

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,400
flexibility

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,520
in um you know how large your uh

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,200
mosaic display is or how people scroll

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
or how they build a collection for

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
themselves

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,200
there are lots of wonderful things that

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,520
can be done with software

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,559
but at the end of the day in order to

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,799
actually create

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,480
a system that people can use and to be

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,000
sure that the information that's stored

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,720
in it is relevant

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,320
you need to be able to pull records out

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
that is inclusive of the metadata that

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
you have

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,880
in drupal we don't have a very

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
sophisticated list of the metadata that

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,919
we

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,840
you know include um one of the primary

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,400
use cases that we have is we basically

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
build an

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
inventory it's a google sheet it's super

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,159
simple

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,600
you know it has the name and uh you know

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,400
the type of content

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,960
that the item is also its publication

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,520
date

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,000
and then all of the taxonomies are

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,159
usable as filters so you can filter by

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
topics and by products and by product

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,280
lines and

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
a variety of other parent terms

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,039
additionally we took

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,000
our analytics data out of adobe

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,960
analytics

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,960
and also out of our contact database so

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,159
you know records of sales

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,880
and married our inventory of content

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,280
and our metadata from our cms up with

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,760
the

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,520
um you know web performance and

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,000
ultimately the business earnings

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,760
of each individual piece of content this

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,440
is super valuable to us because it gives

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,440
us a chance to say okay it's not just a

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,000
matter of raw popularity

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
it is also this you know contextual

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
understanding of how

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,760
our uh content performs so for instance

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
occasionally we'll find something that

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,240
is a really highly detailed document

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
and some people say for instance in

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,559
marketing would say there's maybe not so

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,360
much

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,799
value to this however if we look at it

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
and we say well there's only five people

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,640
who download it

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,200
however those five people ended up

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
buying

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,640
five hundred thousand dollars worth of

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,440
linux it's probably important to ensure

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,360
that that

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,960
document stays up to date and that we

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,960
continue making documents like it

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,840
so it's really important to be able to

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,320
get access to um

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,159
you know your uh the data that's within

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,799
your content management system and again

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,000
csv

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,840
format is really important i also

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,440
highly stress that you want to make sure

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,120
that the values um

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,799
that are separated you know comma

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,880
separated values are great

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,240
but occasionally you know you can end up

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,320
with a system where

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,760
all of your terms are in one list and it

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,720
becomes very ugly

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,320
so you know looking at um what kind of

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
filtering you're going to want to be

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,600
able to do

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,640
and what your other use cases are is uh

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,840
really important in that case

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,760
when you're building these search

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,559
experiences you know be it for

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,440
um in my case redhat.com or you know

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,200
this

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,000
digital asset manager um one of the few

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,360
things that

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,760
i really deeply and fundamentally

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,320
believe

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
is that a flat taxonomy is very very

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,360
important

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,280
when i first came on board we had an

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
internal library and it was basically

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,360
set up like a

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,200
traditional sort of file tree

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,760
and it got very very complex and

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,280
confusing really rapidly especially

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,679
because you had things broken up

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
sometimes organizationally but sometimes

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,880
by different products

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,960
it was almost impossible to use and it

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,679
was very elaborate now it was very

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,400
logical as far as its hierarchies were

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,159
concerned

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,000
but those hierarchies didn't really make

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,120
sense together and they are simply way

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,480
too deep

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,320
and most of the time when you talk to

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,360
people about taxonomy or you talk with

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,600
them about

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,720
metadata you know their eyes start to

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
glaze over

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,640
taxonomy to them is reminiscent of you

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,200
know their dorky

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,279
high school biology teacher and they

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,279
think of it also as a deep multi-layered

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,400
thing you know a taxonomy is you start

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,880
at kingdom

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,480
and phylum and down to genus and species

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,640
and in between there there's all kinds

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,760
of stuff that it's almost impossible to

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,279
memorize now the reality is that a flat

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,000
taxonomy is oftentimes

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,039
really um intuitive and easy for people

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,880
to use

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,799
on the subject of taxonomies i think

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,799
it's important also that uh

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,000
you know whatever system you're building

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,640
being able to

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
modify that taxonomy is very important

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,600
so being able to change the parent

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,679
categories

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,360
but most importantly being able to

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,400
change the labels on all the records

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,679
within your system

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,760
is critical so for instance um a couple

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,080
of months ago i had to remove a product

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,320
from redhat.com you know and all of the

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,919
records associated with it we have a

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,840
feature that's a bulk tagger so

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,559
basically i'm able to go in

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,480
delete the term and the tag essentially

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,000
falls off all of the records that are

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,919
associated with that term

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,520
so it's a one and done it takes me two

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,520
seconds i clear the cache

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,039
it uh you know it's removed from our

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,440
content delivery network

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,200
and it's a done deal we have another

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
tool however that if you want to get rid

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,279
of a taxonomy term

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,039
you first have to remove that from you

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,840
know that specific term from

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,000
all of the um you know documents and

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,520
records that have that term

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
so you can understand where we're

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
getting into a little bit of a problem

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,039
here

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,240
so it's very important to have a

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,679
flexible flat lightweight taxonomy in my

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,960
opinion

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
and i'm going to give you a bit of an

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,919
example you know why this might be the

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,840
case

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,000
because this is my talk and you can't

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,679
stop me and i can't even see you

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,760
i'm going to talk to you about my big

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,400
hobby and that is mycology which is the

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,919
study of

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,080
molds spores and fungus i really enjoy

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,679
hunting for wild mushrooms and messing

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,000
around with culinary stuff

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,919
it's just a great hobby but one of my

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,320
favorite parts about it is it's a very

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,440
taxonomy heavy discipline as well

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,120
there are many millions of um you know

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,880
different species of fungi probably

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,919
around 1.5 million so

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,960
and who's counting um and so you know

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,159
there's a very very

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,240
rich taxonomy associated with the study

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
that said most people you know when

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,440
they're looking for a mushroom or

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,039
thinking about mushrooms it's a really

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,320
basic template and they have a very

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,559
specific need

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,600
i think this is a good parallel to um

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,600
you know the sort of

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,960
digital library experience i'm trying to

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,720
provide to people

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,279
even though as the back end user and an

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
administrator i want to be able to look

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,400
at all of the seven different names

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,080
something has had

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,520
the front end user wants something very

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,240
simple so

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,919
let's talk about the uh the shiitake

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,559
mushroom probably one of the most

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,400
popular culinary mushrooms in the world

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,000
and because it's so popular it's been

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,559
studied for a long time

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,039
and as a result of that is actually had

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,440
um

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,440
seven different classifications seven

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,200
different lennayan names

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
now if you're super into mushrooms like

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
i am that's great and you can

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,960
you know dig through taxonomies and the

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,440
history of you know the changelog

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,360
all you want and figure out why people

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,679
named it that and why they moved it to a

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,559
different genus etc and so on

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,400
but for most people what they're doing

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,600
in relation to shiitake mushrooms is

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,279
walking into a store

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,640
looking for the produce section looking

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,000
for the mushrooms

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,039
and then looking for the bin that is

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,960
labeled shiitake so i'd like to

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,399
you know propose that information

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,159
environments digital information

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,159
environments especially for

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,159
you know web users who can be pretty

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,919
much anybody in the world

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,600
um this should be simple they should be

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,600
straightforward and

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
you know as much as you may be an expert

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,679
and have uh you know

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,640
really relish developing these um

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,159
complex

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,399
but very nuanced ways of getting

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,279
information you're usually not

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,799
actually doing um your audience a

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,840
service

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,760
so as a result of auditing our content

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,640
also getting access and ensuring that

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,760
the data in our systems had integrity

00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,039
and then um you know working to sort of

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,960
understand the overall value um that our

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,120
audience finds in the content we're able

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,880
to do some optimization work

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,960
so red hat about two-thirds of our

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,679
revenue comes originally

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640
from contacts that we make in organic

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,799
search

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,640
now because um a lot of the materials

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,720
that we create are sort of old-fashioned

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,799
you know we have a lot of pdfs

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,000
uh we've been making an effort to

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,080
publish these kinds of documents in html

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,760
now when we do that the traffic for

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,080
those particular pieces tends to be

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
anywhere between 10 and 15 times

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,159
the amount that a traditional pdf would

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
get especially for organic traffic and

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
this allows us also to sort of grow our

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,840
information ecosystem for

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,000
specialized topics that come from sort

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,240
of our technical teams

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
so in looking at this information of uh

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,200
you know our metadata we're able to

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,480
identify okay

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,159
what are the things that people are

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,760
interested in what are the things that

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,480
maybe we don't have quite enough

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,679
on and then we use that to uh migrate

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,279
that content and

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,919
make sure that it is created and

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,080
published in html first

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,360
we also have a content analysis program

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,360
so we're able to

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,799
you know work with different campaigns

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,480
we have an editorial

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,880
uh board and we have a couple of

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,600
different you know sort of um

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,480
programs that are designed to uh you

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,200
know project

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,440
and to articulate red hat's position

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,159
especially on a particularly interesting

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,279
you know element of open source software

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,159
so we're able to

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,799
uh you know perform analyses my team has

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,720
done

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,480
somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 of

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,440
them and we split them up by all kinds

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,039
of things

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,720
so you know if you are the owner of a

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,399
particular product we can give you an

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,120
analysis of your content

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,600
if you are working within of our one of

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,440
our

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,520
vertical teams so you know say for

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
instance you work with

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,600
telecommunications

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,440
we can talk to you about the performance

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,120
of your telecommunications content that

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,120
is published in french

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,880
and you're interested in organic traffic

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,159
instead of conversion traffic and people

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,919
buying things

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,200
so this level of nuance and detail is

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,039
really helpful

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,039
and uh and it allows us to you know

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,200
understand and analyze our content

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,039
really uh start to also wrap our heads

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,279
around what are we known

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,240
for and are we saying the things that we

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,640
want to say

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,760
and going back to you know google's um

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
principles around

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,480
expertise authority and trustworthiness

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,720
seeing the kind of content that people

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,760
access will give you a sense of whether

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,640
or not you are

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,320
in fact delivering the kind of message

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,520
that you want

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,679
and if not then you can refocus um

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,880
another thing that we have done that's

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,200
really helped

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,080
i think the entire business sort of

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,679
understand

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,360
metadata and participate in the

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,880
development of you know

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,240
our our content software is um

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,080
our metadata governance committee so we

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,799
meet on a monthly basis it's an open

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,960
meeting

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,480
anyone can attend and we often do have

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,240
people from the business or

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,000
you know software developers who are

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,600
working on our um you know business

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,600
applications who attend

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,120
and we just basically talk about new

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,760
terms that we want to add to our

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,120
taxonomies or terms we need to remove

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,880
or disambiguation we need to do and so

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,640
you know it's an open forum on a monthly

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,640
basis where people can bring to the

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,480
table their need for new metadata or

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,240
even just a need to be able to find

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,480
content a little more easily

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,159
that maybe we should design a label for

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
so we do that on a monthly basis

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,919
it's very open very collaborative and

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
it's very much the red hat way

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,519
it also is an opportunity for us to form

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,480
relationships with people

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,399
and to basically demystify the idea of

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,600
metadata and being sort of a business

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,600
stakeholder in building

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,679
um you know athlete like web

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,559
applications or search applications

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,000
content management systems etc and then

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,960
a couple of days after

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
our um you know our open collaborative

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
fiesta

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
the librarians and owners of the

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,679
different tools get together

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,640
we um you know update the tools that are

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,880
relevant

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,559
we uh keep a change log and we also

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,799
maintain a data dictionary

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,559
and we do that every single month so

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,640
every time we change something we have a

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,840
really clear record of what we did

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,760
and why we did it so

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,519
i also want to talk about you know i

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,360
think the character

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,200
of the work that i do and the things

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,120
that i find to be inspiring

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,880
um you know i think the very first thing

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,519
that i discovered is i was not going to

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,840
be

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
uh you know again just an organizer of

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
content

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,919
but that i was going to be really

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,760
closely involved with the development of

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,399
these systems that weren't working very

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,159
well

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,760
uh to ensure that people could find what

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,240
they want i'm going to drink some

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,240
lemonade

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,159
all right that does the trick

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,000
so you know when i embarked on this

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,799
journey and i realized again that i was

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
going to have

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,720
some agency to work with the developers

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,080
and work with the business to um improve

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,559
our systems

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,799
i realized almost immediately that i had

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,840
to take on a technologist's mindset i

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,840
had to

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,559
and you know fortunately i do have a

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,519
great deal of enthusiasm for trying new

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,880
things

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,080
and also i simply love a good search

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,399
experience and so

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,720
you know this wasn't rocket surgery for

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,760
me but what was new

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,000
was um an understanding that in order to

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,000
get

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,360
good at my job i had to be really good

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,960
at bug hunting

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,279
and there are a couple of reasons for

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,679
this you know i think that first of all

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,480
it

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,080
is the best way to become familiar with

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,679
the systems that you're using

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,279
you know and i've seen people walk in

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,880
the door you know with a lot of

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,679
experience a lot of knowledge

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,080
and they come into contact with uh you

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,519
know a custom content management system

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,640
and it's just like um you know it's

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,679
like touching a live wire so i think

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,640
it's really

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,080
uh interesting to delve into a tool as

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,960
it's been developed for

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,440
a specific group of users at the same

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
time

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,840
as you're looking at the content itself

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,640
and sort of being a librarian about it

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,799
but

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,760
it's really important to also be that

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,760
bug hunter

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,760
so also you can start to understand

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,000
where the limitations of the system

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,919
what do we need to document really well

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,640
and also it's a chance to say hey you

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,519
know

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,919
this is a thing that's busted how bad is

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,520
it

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,359
and oftentimes the developers will be

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,639
like yeah it is busted and it's really

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,399
difficult to fix

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,560
is it really that big of a headache for

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,040
your users and oftentimes you can find a

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,800
way to

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,359
 the system so that that need is

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,200
met without having to create these

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,359
you know elaborate uh technical

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,480
solutions that can be very simply

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,760
uh dealt with in another way i love the

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,679
fact that in my job

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,960
if something is broken or someone can't

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,280
find something

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,480
it is always my turn so if they can't

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,119
find something because

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,560
of a server timeout it's my turn if

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,760
someone can't find something because

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,879
it's labeled wrong

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,440
it's my turn uh if you know content

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,800
hasn't been

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,560
audited appropriately so old content is

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,560
rising to the top because it's been

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
popular forever and the thing that's new

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,200
and shiny is

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,079
is uh you know sitting in the bottom of

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,640
the drawer it is also my turn to figure

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,960
out

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,160
how to fix that problem and that may

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,119
sound daunting but it's actually

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,640
wonderful and it gives you an

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,480
opportunity to build really rich

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,000
rich relationships you know there's

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,920
nothing more satisfying to me than

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,079
talking to a user who's having a problem

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,599
but can't articulate what the issue is

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,520
because they don't spend time in the

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,119
software and being able to walk over to

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,720
the technical team and saying okay this

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,400
is the issue that they have

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,560
it involves these different components

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,480
these are you know i've tested it five

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,920
ways from sunday so i verified that it

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,160
is actually broken

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,440
is it something we need to fix and if so

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,040
how

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,800
i think it's also really helpful when

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,079
you're you know building these road maps

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,880
and trying to develop additional

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,560
features

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,079
uh because there's often times a

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,400
temptation to um

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,079
you know adopt and this is from the

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,079
business side in my experience pretty

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,119
elaborate search experiences

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,440
and you know they're like we're going to

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,440
have this very very specific set of

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,520
filters that people are going to use

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,920
and we'll have you know comprehensive

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,680
documentation and a user guide

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,599
and i love to bring people back to the

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,320
reality of the paradox of the active

00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,680
user

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,839
people are going to jump into your

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,280
software right away and start using it

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,359
and one of the first things that almost

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,800
everybody is going to start doing

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,720
almost immediately no matter what the

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,720
software is is try to find

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,400
things now of course in an information

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,760
environment that's really all you are

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,200
doing is uniting people with the

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,839
knowledge that they need

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,359
um but i think it's really fun to put

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,880
yourself in the position of a user and

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,520
say okay i am

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,520
going to behave the way that i ought to

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,200
in a digital space which is if i cannot

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,839
get the information that i need

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,920
that kind of denigrates the quality of

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,920
the experience and that makes me

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,680
want to find another source of

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,520
information in addition to the

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,400
inconvenience of not being able to

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,200
navigate the system uh cleanly so i

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,520
think that um

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,200
you know articulating this is oftentimes

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,960
very helpful for business use

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,119
you know your business stakeholders to

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,040
hear i think one of the most

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,800
valuable sources of information and

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,320
input that you could have

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,160
when you're trying to build information

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,680
systems and environments

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,400
is the projects and the problems and the

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,119
pains

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,720
of your passionate amateurs so i'm

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,800
talking about the people who will hack

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,560
together a solution to a crummy problem

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,359
that they have in the content management

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,880
system

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,640
because they need to get their work done

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,520
and they're always looking for new and

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,240
exciting ways to get around you know the

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,720
hurdles that they encounter

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,359
i think that also it gives you a sense

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,280
of where

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,720
people are willing to put their efforts

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,560
that gives you an additional sense of

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,560
what is very valuable to them

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,800
and what you need to be able to provide

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,079
in terms of the user experience

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,680
on my team that person is brian uh when

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,079
brian first came to us

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,800
he was really excited to bring together

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,240
the uh

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,839
analytics information and the

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,400
information from our content management

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,160
system to build these uh inventories and

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,000
provide people with greater access to

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,960
our content greater insight into what

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,640
was working

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,320
but he wanted to take it further he

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,160
wanted to make it easy for people to

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,280
submit requests for content to be

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,680
published

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,119
and to uh you know label their uh

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,119
content appropriately

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,800
and have it um you know go into our

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,560
project management system and then

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,440
subsequently into publishing

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,040
in a smooth and automated fashion so uh

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,560
he built a google form that we can

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,079
basically use to take in that

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,000
information and put it into

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,800
uh the software where we basically

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,920
manage you know all of our tasks

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,280
he also used uh you know similarly uh

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,839
that data to

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,040
send automated notifications to people

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,280
who own content

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,640
after three and after six months of that

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,240
content being published

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,400
because it's super important to be able

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
to say okay what's working what isn't

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,680
um and ultimately he wasn't able to do

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,320
that with the tools that we had

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,640
available

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,599
so he wrote a couple of python scripts

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
we used

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,880
you know really simple components like

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,240
google forms

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,240
and runs the whole thing off of a

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,920
raspberry pi on his desk

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,520
and what i would propose to you is you

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,800
want to find the people who are

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,560
running the raspberry pi unplug it

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,480
tip it over and shake it and you will

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,920
find some really good future features

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,520
because again the people who are willing

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,760
to work hard and come up with

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,440
creative solutions to certain problems

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,560
are also the people who understand what

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,200
the biggest problems

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,160
are and this is really important because

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,480
you're going to be

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,320
um you know more than likely involved

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,160
with a project where you have to build

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,240
software that has been purchased by

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,680
someone who doesn't necessarily know how

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,320
software is designed

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,920
at this point in time 40 of the software

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,480
and technology business

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,920
you know technology buying power resides

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,560
with the business units

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,240
in different organizations now that has

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,000
its value because of course

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,440
those are the organizations that know

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,520
exactly what the need is

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,200
and what their associates are struggling

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,760
with however

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,280
a lot of times you know there are uh

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,640
software systems and software as a

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,079
service in particular is kind of

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,839
becoming ubiquitous for these

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,680
uh you know knowledge management systems

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,760
of all kinds

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,200
they need to be built in a way that was

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,800
that is very thoughtful and

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,800
very straightforward but also with a

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,760
full understanding of what's going on

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,040
under the hood

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,520
now if you um you know sort of

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,040
look at the totality of features that

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,720
are available occasionally

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,240
people who are purchasing software as a

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,920
service will focus on

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,160
you know the user interface or some of

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,839
the different tools and configurations

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,520
but ultimately you want to make sure

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,560
that you can build a collection that has

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,800
relationships

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,319
that ties things together that basically

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
each individual piece of content that

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,800
you have

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,000
functions as a star in a larger

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,560
constellation

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,400
superimposes additional meaning that

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,880
basically helps tell your story

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
and helps articulate to your users what

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,400
you need to convey to them

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,319
so this is an example from our digital

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,839
asset management system that we built in

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,400
2019 and have been

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,520
you know adopted adopted business wide

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,520
at this point

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,880
um and one of the biggest challenges

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,720
that we had was establishing

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,400
relationships between different pieces

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,000
of content that were related

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,760
so for instance people would be looking

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,240
for a white paper but they also wanted a

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,880
digital banner ad or they wanted um

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,079
you know uh email template copy

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,319
something similar

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,319
so we built the system to uh you know

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,560
reflect those relationships and to build

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,000
very simple publishing mechanisms into

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,760
the system so it's evil

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,240
easy to build those relationships and

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,520
essentially again curate the content in

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,119
a way that's meaningful

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,599
and a way that's flexible and could be

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,280
reconfigured if necessary

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,880
all of that said one of the great things

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,359
about software as a service is that you

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,960
can do

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,720
all kinds of really interesting things

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,079
with it you know you don't have to worry

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,000
about hosting it

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,599
the uh you know vendor takes care of a

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,560
lot of things people just go into their

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,079
browsers and

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,640
and use the tool and that's all they

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,440
need a lot of these different solutions

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,680
do employ

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,240
you know machine learning some ai

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,720
sometimes natural language processing

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,800
in order to sort of execute some of the

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,480
search and recommendation engines

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,480
i will say that those are really cool

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,400
features i would not make a single

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,160
decision based upon them however

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,440
i think it's important to bear in mind

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,119
that those things are relevant in the

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,280
future but more often than not when i'm

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,599
looking at a knowledge management system

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,400
or a cms what i'm looking at is

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,319
something that is

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,160
difficult to get the information out of

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,800
it's difficult to change the labeling

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,880
system and the organizational structure

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,839
and ultimately the teams are just not

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,920
ready to use

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,359
the amount of information that comes out

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,560
of machine learning and ai

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,960
algorithms so i think it's important uh

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
to

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,079
you know consider that but i also think

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,119
it's important to when you're working

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,960
with people say

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,720
we need to focus on the foundational

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,520
basics how do we ensure

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,880
that you know when a new version of our

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,880
software releases

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,480
that everyone finds the most recent

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,000
version of documentation

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,920
and not something that was published two

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,160
years ago

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,839
so in conclusion i want to talk to you

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,000
very briefly about the four things that

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,880
i consider to be the deliverables of my

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,720
job

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,839
um and how i get the information that i

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,079
need to um you know execute on those

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:47,280
deliverables

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,599
first i have user interfaces for my

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,040
uh you know content management software

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,280
i also have to deliver

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,240
governance and flexibility so

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,160
essentially

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,000
building search experiences that have

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,880
the tools and also the

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
informational flexibility to um to

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,599
accommodate

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,800
new forms of knowledge that come into my

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,640
collection

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,160
so you know talking with users and

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,240
understanding the jobs that they have to

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,640
get done is absolutely critical

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,800
also talking with people about taxonomy

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,240
and metadata is important

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,000
and it's something that you know again

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,800
may be intimidating to people at first

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,480
but usually

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,960
when you explain it as a good labeling

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,839
system you will get people interested in

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,319
it because people

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,200
love to go from the vague to the

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,800
specific

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,200
especially if it means that the things

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,920
they put effort into writing or creating

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,280
get used now when you start to get more

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,599
advanced and things are

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,880
you know more sophisticated uh working

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,280
on application

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,880
integration uh bringing data from

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,079
different applications together

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,240
and also managing and analyzing

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,680
organization-wide data becomes uh

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,160
instrumental

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,880
so a lot of that work comes in

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,839
understanding

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,400
how different software systems connect

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,280
um

00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,839
and so you know in our case uh we're

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,640
building

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,359
a um virtual data infrastructure that

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,800
sort of

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,240
collects all the information that's

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,240
coming out of our different software

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,280
systems and also makes it easy easily

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,599
accessible so

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,280
little api connections can be built you

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,800
have loosely coupled applications

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,640
throughout our environment

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,720
and then ultimately at the base layer

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,440
you can pull all of our enterprise data

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,680
out and

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,400
you know slice it dice it analyze it

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,119
using some very sophisticated techniques

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,720
but again that data access and integrity

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,160
making sure that things are

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,960
um you know tidy and prioritized for

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,960
truth

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,160
is i think one of the primary things

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,359
that i bring to the table

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,760
and that my team works to achieve

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,720
now this is uh truth happens is one of

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,480
the watch words

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,800
at red hat our uh ceo paul cormier

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,079
um you know is really fond of saying

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,760
that we simply

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,000
don't understand what the truth is going

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,880
to be in the future we only understand

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,200
the truth that is

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,280
now but it is constantly happening it's

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,440
constantly evolving this is why we

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,319
participate in open source we like

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,880
things to go rapidly we love innovation

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,119
we love

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,079
learning where we're wrong and improving

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,440
and i think one of

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,119
of course one of my favorite quotes

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
about the understanding of change and

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,839
how

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,960
truth and how you know authority and

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,280
expertise can

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,200
shift over time is the statement that

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,000
bill gates made in the 80s about how

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,000
640 k is about as much computing power

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,800
as anyone could ever possibly want

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,800
we all know especially bill gates knows

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,960
that that is not the case

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,160
now i appreciate your time very much at

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,480
the very end of the day

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,079
i think that my job is rewarding because

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,880
i have an opportunity to work with

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,200
software

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,200
work with people who work with software

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,760
and work on search experiences

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,680
with an eye toward ensuring that uh you

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,480
know we're communicating

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,280
not just in a comprehensive way but in a

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,400
meaningful

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,160
trustworthy way i appreciate your time

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,160
i welcome you to reach out to me on

00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:01,839
linkedin if you have any questions

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,839
and i hope you have a magnificent day

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,040
wow that was a really well delivered

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,119
talk um thanks anna um

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,079
folks if you have any questions i think

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,119
we just have about

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,640
four minutes or so um

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,480
to take questions so if you do have

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,960
questions feel free to drop them

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,119
in the chat and anna will be able to

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,960
respond and if there's any questions and

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,079
you'd like to

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,920
you'd like to come on video you can just

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,160
request to share your av

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,160
and then you can you can talk with a

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,760
participant

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,400
um but if we don't have enough time

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,960
i guess we can move over to the breakout

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,040
um

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:52,640
breakup room i will put a link
