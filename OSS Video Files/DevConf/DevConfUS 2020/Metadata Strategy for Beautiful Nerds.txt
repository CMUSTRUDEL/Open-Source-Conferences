	Speaker: Anna McHugh

Good metadata makes good information easy to find, but 35% of B2B content is never used. Folks who engage with your content deserve care and respect—and metadata empowers them to find what they need. Embrace your inner beautiful nerd and learn methods for connecting people with authoritative, trustworthy, and meaningful knowledge.
You’ll learn how to:
- Audit and analyze your content and tools without spending the rest of your life in a spreadsheet.
- Build metadata and search systems that support your organization’s purpose and expertise.
- Use the GitLab Remote Manifesto to build a knowledge ecosystem that works for people.
- Improve your software by incorporating the ideas (and workarounds) of passionate amateurs.
- Bridge developers and users by becoming a technologist, bug hunter, and expert on your own content collection.
- Develop software integrations that count, and focus people’s passion for ML/AI to build practical features.
- Conquer the world. Or at least content bloat.
