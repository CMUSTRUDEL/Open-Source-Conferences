Checking for security compliance is overall hard. Doing so for a cluster of hundreds of machines is even worse.

Compliance is hard and tedious work, especially on a cluster scale. There are many checkboxes to tick; the controls in the standards are not easy to interpret; and more so, compliance needs to be reached, but also maintained and continuously monitored.
We aimed to address this issue by building the compliance-operator.

This project aims to aid OpenShift deployers to verify, monitor, and ultimately achieve their compliance targets in an automated fashion by checking both the OpenShift configuration and the Linux nodes that form that cluster.
