Title: Privacy in the Age of IOT
Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: DevConfUS 2020
Description: 
	Speaker: Sayak Sarkar

With the ever-increasing presence of smart devices all around our personal and professional lives, privacy seems to be becoming one of the most vulnerable aspects of our everyday lives. This session aims to address some of the biggest privacy concerns that we are faced with everyday in the age of the Internet of things, to spread awareness about digital privacy issues, while also sharing some of the simplest tools and techniques by which we can take better control of our digital lives and our personal information.

We would talk about "Smart" Home Appliances, Automated Vehicles, Voice-Controlled devices connected to the internet and also showcase some quick and easy techniques to safeguard against the most common vulnerabilities. We would also be taking a critical look at the role of enterprises and policymakers, along with the evolution of privacy laws. The end-goal of the session is to spread awareness around privacy concerns in today's "SMART" - everything age.

hi everyone uh we'll be starting now

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,880
please let me know if you have any

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,559
trouble listening

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,559
or viewing the video

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,720
hey everyone my name is

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,439
and i work as a senior software engineer

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,119
professionally i mostly travel with web

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,080
and cloud technologies

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,720
however outside the professional i am an

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,599
open source

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,079
enthusiast and a privacy evangelist with

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
an eye

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,040
towards shiny new emerging tech in both

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
the hardware and software worlds

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,160
today i would be talking about a subject

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
that has been the topic of

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,200
much debate in the recent few years and

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,320
one that deserves a healthy bit of

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,360
skepticism conversation discussions and

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,000
much more

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,800
this topic is privacy in the age of the

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
internet of things

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,840
so the first question that we need to

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
answer before diving into further

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,080
discussions

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,400
is what is iit well

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,119
we have all heard about the term quite a

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,799
bit

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,119
and know that it's an abbreviation for

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,479
something called the internet of things

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,360
but what exactly is the definition of it

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,920
i was curious as well i had heard about

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
iot

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,040
i knew about the term internet of things

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,159
but

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,920
what did it exactly mean so

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,960
like any other uh internet abiding

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
citizen

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
i too went to the one place for all my

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,079
answers

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,360
wikipedia and i found out the definition

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,560
so wikipedia defines iot as a

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,560
system of interrelated computing devices

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
mechanical and digital machines or

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,520
objects

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
that are provided with unique

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,960
identifiers which we also know as

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
uids and the ability to transfer data

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
over a network

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,000
without requiring human to human or

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,920
human to computer interaction

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
so yeah that's all really fancy fine and

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,560
dandy but

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,920
what exactly does it mean what exactly

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,680
does this definition mean for us

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,080
in a layman's approach so

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
it's pretty simple actually it's

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
basically a collective

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,720
term for all the interconnected smart

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,239
devices that we surround ourselves with

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,120
in everyday lives from the smart watches

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,640
that we wear to the smartphones that we

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,120
carry in our pockets

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,720
to smart tvs smart refrigerators

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
smart air conditioners are automated

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,480
home

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,519
management systems or home automation

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
systems

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
well anything and everything that you

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,720
can probably slap the term

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,599
smart onto comes under the purview of

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,640
the internet of things anything that is

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,000
smart

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,280
and connected to the internet and can

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,480
talk to the internet by itself without

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,560
our explicit interactions

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,360
is what comprises the internet of things

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
so okay now we have a basic understand

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,319
of what iot is

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,720
so the next question that comes

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,560
in the purview of this discussion is

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,680
what's privacy then

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,480
how do we define it is it

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,319
a fundamental human right which may or

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,920
may not be explicitly protected by law

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,959
or is it a right to be left alone or

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
is it about something much larger what

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
is it

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,840
then uh well it's a bit more complex

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
than that

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
privacy isn't really about keeping

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,680
things private

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
it's not about secrets but it's about

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,560
the choice

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,599
privacy is the choice to have a say

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,720
in what happens to the data that is

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,080
collected about

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,239
us by any uh

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
collection collection mechanism that

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
might be a

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,959
smart device that might be any other way

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,400
uh devices

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
uh have a lot of data about us uh

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,519
but what happens to this data is

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
something

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,120
that we should have a control over that

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,079
we should have a say

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
it should be by our consent and by our

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,400
express

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,400
consent that anything can be done

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,880
with this data that's privacy

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,800
so the next

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,919
obvious point of discussion that we come

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,280
into is

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,120
so what's the impact of iot on privacy

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,639
and what do the two have to do with each

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,759
other

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,960
well it's it's a pretty

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,080
deep conversation actually uh recently i

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,680
heard uh something

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,759
uh about a statement that mark

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,039
zuckerberg made

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,520
uh so he infamously said that

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,280
privacy should no longer be considered a

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,080
social norm

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,080
what does it mean

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,000
well nothing good i'm afraid

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
even though it sounds disturbing

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
alarming even

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,560
does this statement have any made it to

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
it

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
well that's what we will eventually find

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,280
out

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,560
uh let me try to explain this consider

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,120
this

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
surrounded by a world full of sensors

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,800
around us

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
talking not just with us but also with

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
the internet

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,320
where the data is stored in the cloud

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,320
from where it might be eventually

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,440
packaged and sold are we

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,320
we the consumers really the consumers

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,880
or are we being converted into the

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
product

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
that is being consumed in the grand

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,880
scheme of things

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,319
think about it everyday objects are

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,199
already becoming smarter

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,720
and being connected to the internet the

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
global network

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,479
our computing is slowly diffusing out

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
into our environment

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
from what we do online to what we do

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,160
offline

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
everything can now be tracked analyzed

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,319
and packaged into a bundle

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
ready to be consumed by the biggest fish

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,840
out there in the open market

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,440
for purposes that might not be

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,199
completely known to us

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,520
well mostly they are unknown to us

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,800
do we really have a say do we really

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
know what's going to happen with our

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,639
data

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,400
that photo that you posted on facebook

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,240
and do not even think about twice

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
to check the privacy setting is it

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,319
public or not

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,479
would you be surprised if that photo

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,199
ends up on a billboard

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,759
a few days later do you even have

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,400
control over that data

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,479
you might think that because you are the

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,240
owner of that photo

00:06:52,479 --> 00:07:00,000
uh you should have a c on that right but

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,840
do you really know that if that photo

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
is still your property after you have

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,479
uploaded it

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,840
similarly uh the conversations that you

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,639
have at home

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,199
while you have a smart device listening

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,400
to you

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,160
247 do you really know

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,560
if there if a recording of that

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,120
conversation is being made or not

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,880
and if so does that recording really

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,520
belong to you

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,479
or does it not what's the legalities

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
around it

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,120
do we even understand that and

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,759
have we ever considered what can be the

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,039
long-term

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,919
impact of this data going out there

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,759
well it turns out the consequences at

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,319
times can be severe

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
how severe maybe i can give you an

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,440
example about that

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,360
so this data that goes out

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,120
in the global network

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,360
it has some unintended and unexpected

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,599
consequences from time to time

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
last november uh the silicon valley

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,199
startup

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,479
strava announced a big update to its

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,919
global heat map of

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,960
user activities this map showed over a

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,840
billion user

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,759
activities including running and cycling

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,759
routes of fitness enthusiasts

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
wearing smart watches or other variable

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,840
fitness trackers

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
it so happened to turn out that some

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,199
strava users

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,400
appeared to work for certain militaries

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,200
or various intelligence agencies

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,599
what do you think happened next very

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
soon

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,760
some knowledgeable security experts

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,959
connected the dots

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,919
between the highlighted anonymous user

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,880
activity

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,080
and the known bases or locations of u.s

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,480
military or intelligence operations

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
some analysts even went out as far as to

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
say that the

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,120
data could reveal individual strava

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
users by name

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
think about it what can be the

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,920
consequence of

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,880
such humongous leak

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,080
needless to say the biggest danger here

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,800
was from potential

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,800
adversaries

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,800
by tracking and even identifying

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,160
military

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,600
or intelligence agency personnel as they

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,120
go about their duties or head home after

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
the completion of the deployment

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,720
these these digital footprints that echo

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,680
the real life steps of individuals

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,519
underscore a greater much greater

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
challenge to governments and ordinary

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,200
citizens

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
alike each person's connection to online

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,240
services

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,399
and personal devices makes it

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,880
increasingly difficult to keep

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:52,320
secrets what happens when you have

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,640
such a such a outburst of data

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
what happens when you have such massive

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,320
amount of data flowing out into the

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,240
world wide web

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,440
well you have the great deluge of data

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,160
what happens then because

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,000
a host of convenient smart devices now

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
continuously gather data

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
process and send data to make our lives

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,839
more convenient

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,399
they've also magnified the threats to

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,040
privacy

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
our ability to collect and process data

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,279
has overwhelmed

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,560
our ability to protect that information

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,480
our smartphones fitness trackers smart

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,279
tvs and all other kinds of smart

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,440
appliances generate a massive amount of

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,200
sensitive information from browsing

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,200
habits to purchasing patterns to

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
real-time location to personal health

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,320
information

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
is no longer just about our photos and

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,320
emails

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,519
but also our heart rate respiration rate

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,680
location how we slept and with whom

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
the boundaries of personal spaces are

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,720
quickly disappearing

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,040
since we the consumers willingly give

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,440
them the permission to sell our data

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,240
when we accept the terms and conditions

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
without even

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,040
reading them properly in exchange for

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,360
free services

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,920
the privacy and attention we are trading

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,839
for our free services and content

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,880
is now much more personal

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,480
so this brings us to the big question

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,640
who wants the data who wants this

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,560
entirety

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,560
of the data that's going out there

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
let's see is the data really anonymous

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
do we really know what's being done with

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,480
this data

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,399
well we think it's a matter of ownership

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
who owns the data being collected by

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,600
smart devices to make this device

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,240
smart the footprint

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,519
your devices leave on the internet tells

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,920
a story

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
what do you think that story tells the

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
story is about

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,079
who exactly you are including things

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,200
that

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,680
you yourself might not even know about

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,680
yourself

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,079
think about that let that sink in for a

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,079
moment

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,160
in retrospect the responsibility for

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,720
data privacy

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,839
doesn't just talk about keeping your

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,079
data private

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
but also about taking ownership of your

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,639
personal data

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,959
and what you want to share with the

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,079
world think about what would be the

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,240
implication of this

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,959
unchecked propagation of your private

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,399
data after a few years down the line

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,360
both in your personal and private life

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,040
think about what might happen if someone

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
can actually predict

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,160
what you're about to do next what can

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,680
they do with this data about you

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,279
we already talked about the straw by

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,399
example

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,519
think about what would happen if someone

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
had

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,680
all your personal data and knew

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,240
everything about your personal life

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,440
just let that sink in and think about

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,440
what they can do with that

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,760
so the responsibility

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,440
of data privacy seems to be the obvious

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,680
point that we should be talking about so

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,560
it might seem counter-intuitive but you

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,880
know

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,839
data privacy does not necessarily mean

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,360
keeping our data

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,680
private it means taking charge of what

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,880
we

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,360
choose to divulge about ourselves

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,720
we now leave a trail of data behind us

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,240
that grows

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,279
wider with every smart device we acquire

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,519
billions of smarter and smarter devices

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,560
uh will soon paint highly detailed

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,240
portraits of

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,160
almost everything that we do

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,360
internet of things our iot devices

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,760
deserve a healthy

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,360
dose of skepticism when it comes to

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,600
information security and

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,760
data privacy installing a small piece of

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
technology within your premises may not

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,120
seem like a

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,199
risk management decision but a poorly

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
configured iot device can open

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,839
your door too

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,639
given that we do not have full control

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,839
over the devices that

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,079
require our data to work we must pay

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,760
very close attention to the data that we

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,079
share

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,880
carefully read the end user license

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,079
agreement or

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,360
eola before selecting the yes i agree

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,240
option

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,600
protect your electronic doorway to our

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,720
to your home

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,839
by setting up a secure router change the

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
default password

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,399
of any new iot device that you set up

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,360
in fact use strong passwords passwords

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,880
that are unique

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,839
for all your online accounts probably

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
that would help you keep your data safe

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
and

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,000
even more private at the end the

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
responsibility for data privacy comes

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,600
down

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,720
to the individual if the individual is

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,000
alert if the individual is cautious

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,120
you don't really need to worry much

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,560
going ahead about how much data

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
is going out about you

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,760
well this this topic is about something

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,279
that

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,800
i was really happy about when it

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,360
happened

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,639
so a great thing happened uh over the

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,079
course of the last few years

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
yeah and that's the introduction of the

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,600
general

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,040
data protection regulation or gdpr in

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,000
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,800
and its eventual implementation in 2018

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
by the european union

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,120
uh gdpr pushed into effect

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,399
and added emphasis by organizations all

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,199
across the world

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,000
in general to focus on data privacy and

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,800
clearly

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,040
inform consumers about how their data is

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,160
being used

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,839
since the internet by its

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,680
uh by its own definition is a global

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,480
entity

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,519
a major regulation such as gdpr in the

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,880
european union had global consequences

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,600
and this led to something that was

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,880
very much awaited and that was very much

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,160
welcomed by

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,800
uh conservationists

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,360
and conservatives and privacy

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,560
enthusiasts like us

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,959
so in over 30 years we have debated over

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,600
in

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,800
privacy in the internet with not much

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,920
success

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,199
due to a myriad due to a large number of

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,720
immediate reasons

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,839
regulation still moves at a snail space

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,959
ironically it's up to ceos executives

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,320
and employees to reject projects that

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,560
put profit over privacy iot and

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,040
connectivity are growing rapidly

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,360
and to keep up with the space privacy

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
regulation strategies need to be applied

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,800
during the design phase

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,360
itself from design to manufacture to

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,679
eventual disposable

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,720
to the eventual disposal there needs to

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,799
be an

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
effort to make more ethical design

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,760
choices

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,600
looking at the internet of things we

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,280
realize that it is still

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,439
in its infancy we can still have a say

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,000
from the very initial stages about the

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,480
need for regulation to allow consumers

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,880
to take control of their data

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,520
it's time we take a closer look at the

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,160
whole

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
life cycle of a smart device and focus

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,919
upon how we can go

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,080
even beyond the scope of gdpr and look

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,120
at the broader scope for data privacy in

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,720
internal connected devices

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,360
sadly however legislation like gdpr

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,960
rely on privacy scandals becoming pr

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,559
nightmares for manufacturing

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,960
companies the issue here

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,280
is that large corporations usually don't

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,280
care about consumer data privacy

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,000
as long as everything is just working

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,280
fine and no one is complaining

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,679
what would it take uh to convince the

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,400
decision makers to become a bit more

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,120
proactive

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,400
and sensitive towards protecting

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,400
consumer privacy

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,640
well moving forward we need to be

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,679
careful

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
in considering how iot may intersect

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,160
with

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,720
personal privacy data protection

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,160
to start with we can take a few small

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,440
but important steps to reduce risk

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,360
number one isolate iot devices with

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,440
separate logical segments of the network

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,200
make sure that you don't have

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,679
your smart devices all connected

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,480
to the same network if that happens if

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,200
one of them

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,799
is compromised there's a chance that all

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
of them might get compromised

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,120
so isolation of iot devices into

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,960
separate logical segments of

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,400
the network reduces that risk by

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,400
a whole lot much

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,919
monitor data flows and watch for

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,120
unexpected or

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,760
anomalous traffic patterns i don't need

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,679
to speak

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,919
much about this you know what this might

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,559
mean any anomalies in your network

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
traffic

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,200
might mean that something

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,880
or someone else is probably

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,760
having a really nice time with the

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,760
network connection

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,880
ensure that iot buying decisions are

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,360
driven

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,600
by security considerations such as the

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,679
ability to change default passwords

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
receive and apply patches and disable

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,480
the unneeded

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:47,039
services on any iot device

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,480
so moving on

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,400
how do we secure ourselves then

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,840
it's not just about securing our data

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,679
but it's also about

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,679
securing devices

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,159
the design of iot technology focuses on

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,840
convenience

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,320
not security which makes our data

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,640
vulnerable

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,640
managing the risks associated with data

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,880
collection begins with making the

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,919
gathered data more secure

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,200
the time has come now to ask what trap

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,280
what does privacy truly require

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,120
right now uh threats include hardware

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,360
vulnerabilities network threats

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,400
ransomwares and distributed denial of

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,600
service which we call ddos attacks

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,760
simple uh steps like securing a home

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,000
router can prevent vulnerable devices

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,679
from

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,880
being severely compromised and save

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,880
you a lot of trouble and also a lot of

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,200
so how can privacy and security be built

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,480
into

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,120
services and devices right a common

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,480
approach

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,280
for iot is to use

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,000
factory provisioned security keys and

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,960
store them

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,799
in some secure otp area in the device

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,200
these keys are then used as the basis

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,840
for all encryption authentication and

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,159
ota operations

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,000
iot core development and architecture

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,880
design allows

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,760
the need to follow a secure by design

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,559
approach

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,360
it means that new iot products need to

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,760
integrate

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,280
security into product development as

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,000
early as possible during the product

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,000
life cycle

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,280
device architecture and data storage

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,080
should be designed in such a way that

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,280
enables

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,600
gdpr compliance and finally

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,640
keys and iot device provisioning should

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,200
comply with

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,840
security and privacy data management

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,840
guidelines

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,080
so as

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,200
you know the iot ecosystem evolves and

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,760
expands

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,520
how do we ensure that our new levels of

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,000
security and privacy provisions are

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,880
implemented

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,559
well to make iot solutions secure and

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,280
enable privacy

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,400
architecture design and development have

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
to include

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
security features at the very early

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,400
phases

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,760
iot systems are distributed so it's

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
crucial to have

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,400
unified and well-defined security

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,280
guidelines to enable encryption

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,679
for devices on multiple layers either

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,120
the transport layer or the security keys

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,640
or security certificates integration

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,159
with third-party services

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,799
may also introduce new security breaches

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,640
so it is crucial to check that all

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,640
components comply with

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,480
security guidelines and provide

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,400
interfaces that are secure

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,559
and could be provisioned in a proper way

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,559
it's more and more beneficial to include

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,280
security and privacy monitoring

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,960
components

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,000
into the iot ecosystem

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,200
with ai and data-driven approach these

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,760
components enable

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,559
not only reporting of existing security

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,360
issues

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,240
but also can generate some insights to

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,440
prevent

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,720
security incidents incidents like some

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,720
of what we already discussed

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,000
so

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,480
some basic uh you know

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,760
some very basic steps and some

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,440
very logical implementation of security

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,159
and privacy provisions

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,320
within the devices itself can go a long

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,320
way

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,440
at the end of the day i would

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,400
i just want to highlight that privacy is

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,600
something

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,120
that comes to us from within and it's a

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,520
very intimate choice

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,520
we need to be conscious about it in all

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,520
walks of life whether it's digital or

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,520
analog or social

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,640
if you're not conscious enough we end up

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,679
paying the price

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,520
in one way or the other

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,600
whether we are a consumer or

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
manufacturer we need to be conscious

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,320
about the impact of

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,880
our decisions on privacy and security in

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,120
general

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
rather than simply focusing on

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,440
convenience

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,840
so and with that thank you everyone

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,799
