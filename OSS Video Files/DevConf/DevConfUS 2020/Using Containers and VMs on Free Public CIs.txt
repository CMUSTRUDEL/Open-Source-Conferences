	Speakers: David Davis & Mike DePaulo

At first glance, free public CIs seem insufficient for testing many open source projects. They provide only a single virtual machine with no choice of Linux distro, and no container or virtual infrastructure.

However, many projects are publishing as containers, or even kubernetes operators. Many have conventional installers that must be tested across numerous Linux distros. Some need SELinux or other CI-disabled kernel features.

This talk will explain how our project overcame all these limitations: container infrastructure and full virtual machines running on top of free public CIs, and alternative solutions that also work. The solutions will consist of a comparison of CI-compatible open source container infrastructures and hypervisors, CI design patterns for them, and other tips & tricks for integrating them.
