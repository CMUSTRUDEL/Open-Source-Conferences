Description: 
	Todays software industry is booming with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Vagrant and more to enable faster turnaround times via virtualization.

How does Eclipse the IDE deal with that ? Can it deal with it ? How should it and its users deal with it ?

Come to this talk and hear how and what Eclipse Linux Tools and JBoss Tools are doing in the area.

It will give a brief overview on the Docker and Vagrant tooling in Linux Tools and then how that is used and combined in Kubernetes and OpenShift Tools.

The talk will show how you can use Docker and Vagrant practically today with plain Eclipse to improve your own local development experience and then shortly cover how it all comes together in the cloud and container space.

Some basic understanding of the container and virtualization technologies are recommended, but not an absolute requirement.
