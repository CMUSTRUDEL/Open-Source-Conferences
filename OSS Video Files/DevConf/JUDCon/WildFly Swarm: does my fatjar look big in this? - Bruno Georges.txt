Description: 
	Application servers are dead? We hear more and more than Linux containers, microservices and DevOps do away with the need for traditional Java application servers, particularly those based on Java EE. In this session we'll look at WildFly-swarm a subproject of WildFly, the leading open source Java application server. We'll see how the underlying architecture
allows WildFly to be trimmed down to give you Just Enough Application Server (JeAS?) and retain those key capabilities your application (or microservice) needs as well as creating a self-contained executable jar.
