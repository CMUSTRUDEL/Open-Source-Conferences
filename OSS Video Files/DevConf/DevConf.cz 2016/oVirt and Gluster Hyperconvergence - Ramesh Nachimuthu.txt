Title: oVirt and Gluster Hyperconvergence - Ramesh Nachimuthu
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	Ovirt and Gluster Hyperconvergence architecture is a setup where oVirt and Gluster both will run in single commodity boxes that can scale horizontally. This talk will focus on the details of design, configuration and installation of hyper converged hosts with oVirt as the software stack and Gluster for the storage.

and I think him sometimes over here as

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:16,199
well I think the morning here tamoxifen

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:23,240
a sparse you can do to give us a

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,240
depressant as you can see the list

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,020
yes i got it from a minute

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:18,200
with the dogs take white colleges

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:20,990
require to them today facility in the

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,440
creation process so did encourage people

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,950
to come over and to be there around 8p

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,460
some other things that's been a process

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:37,040
maybe a few different goodies so come

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:40,720
over take position all those who is here

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:47,570
we have few scars presenter can give as

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:51,380
if questions thanks apart so now please

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:58,010
welcome vanish with our hostel engineer

00:02:51,380 --> 00:03:00,530
I guess nothing to working in red bad

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,140
mood for over teen mostly work with over

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,820
ten wrestler integration playing will be

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,230
talked about overton cluster into the

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,380
convergence so how many of you know but

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:17,230
that's good how many of you use overt

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:19,400
great with cluster over to cluster good

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,550
dick maybe this might be interesting for

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,230
you now this is going to be the end of

00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,150
our next 40 minutes first time we

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,280
believe you through word may be most

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,459
happy since no I will just roughly talk

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,430
about the architecture and storage then

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,850
I talk to you about poster engine then

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,220
my will reduce you to cluster and basic

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,480
components in the yes sir then we see

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,480
how to set up a hyper converged

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,130
infrastructure using overton cluster how

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,800
it looks on how to set up and how do you

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,450
manage the setup then i will talk a

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,600
little bit about the recent enhancements

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:57,930
we did for hyper conversions case in

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,900
overt as well as mr. it started

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,549
so basically what word is a

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,189
virtualization management platform which

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:08,579
helps you to manage your virtual

00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:11,400
machines also for storage also storage

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:15,090
and networks further generations case if

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,509
you see from the diagram on top behaves

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,180
over engine that runs in a separate

00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,400
hardware and inside a neighbor saw Vicki

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,039
since and where that the warden he's

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,979
returning J Maas didn't get we and

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,240
running synergy of us application server

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:35,039
that takes care of managing your

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,620
reservations and storage / busy users

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:42,479
post uses post native scale as a DB and

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,430
that exposes may to individuals for the

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,740
user to communicate only is the web

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,750
admin quarter where you can define your

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,449
cluster you can add your faith ourselves

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,620
we can add your storage nodes and you

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,520
can create your we'll chill me since

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,639
then also it was nice it is rest api

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,830
which can be used to integrate over with

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,430
other management platforms like manage a

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,320
QR cloud forms etc below or do you see

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,250
the clusters it's like a crystal of

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:15,270
course those are assisting enabled

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,400
mostly we use kvm utility system that

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,090
takes care of many virtual machines in

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,840
the post / Pixar something called BDSM

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,909
it's a it's a it's an ancient demon

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,849
running all the hypervisor and it's

00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:32,849
written using python that takes care of

00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:35,849
all the hard cooling coil world over

00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:38,340
communities community to currently to

00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,830
host through video so you'd ask me

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,110
listen to like create virtual machine or

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,330
stop the virtual machine as totally vm

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,449
attached disk all those hearts absurd

00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:51,449
done by the variation just the man

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:54,389
adjustable and underneath you see

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,340
storage so traditionally forward

00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,290
supports different

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:04,190
just like in uppers CPRS cassie in the

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:06,560
syllabus itself that can be managed make

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,590
lists are managed me over there it can

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:15,350
be cheaper and awkward like he's kcr FCP

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:19,490
enough us next we will c CQ bookstore is

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:22,160
a little chill so slow release may

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:27,080
compounding overt because the medium

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,840
completely relies on the storage form to

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,760
store the virtual machine images and as

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,330
well as the country files and other

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,750
things also it relies on the storage

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:42,530
firm thing coming season between the

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,550
region's try to the same william

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:48,200
shouldn't be running at multiple

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,169
hypervisors also the rocking and chicken

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,340
is a least a hundred bills and lock and

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:55,250
that's done through storage domain is

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,949
this actual storage here and over

00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,940
supports the storages like in the first

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:04,669
six eps pc there is one of the storages

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,310
and restaurateurs because in advance of

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:09,050
mothers if she'd be so it's a single

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,370
point that says where you have to

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,979
communicate to your course to get your

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,410
storage but dresser this is different

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,050
because it's a clustered very system

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:21,110
ebook and it has multiple posts so if

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,750
one was phase variation word can talk to

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,690
other course to get the PM images or

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,690
other data register fist is more useful

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,410
next goes to the engine you see in the

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,830
previous slide over engine runs in a

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:44,370
separate convent and that's again l like

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:48,240
that if what if that mission fails that

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,400
Sofia is fine also you have to dedicate

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,150
on hardware for further we have quite

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,350
the forward engine instead you can do

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,140
something called you can do something

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,480
called question anything back the

00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,700
over-engineered will run in a DM and

00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,700
that vm will grant you any of those we

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:10,200
make yourself or you can hit it up

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,570
almost one physical post also you get

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,060
fetch it won first place the over these

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,650
you can run are under boost you get

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:22,560
ketchup a Roman engineers were gone in

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:25,880
this post editing setup they something

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,300
called him do posted in a change in

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,729
under a powerlessness so that if one

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,110
post pays the other goes will

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,290
automatically start the hosted anything

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:41,070
on it and that can manage all other

00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,690
forceps for then the overthinking will

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,470
be always running and you can always

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:49,860
manage your posts but it's kind of

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:53,130
chicken external with us since you have

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,100
vm its manages itself and the other goes

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,290
which are running the VA so what we need

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,830
is led to do some boost you have to do

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,320
boots el primer to bring up this video

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,330
then add the other hosts maybe I will

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,650
talk about this later with more

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:14,370
information I accept if so do you do it

00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,260
ok that is about plus posted easy next

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,420
is closer FS guess you all know

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,480
aggressive FS is a open source disputed

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,660
file system it runs on any commodity

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:30,810
hardware and it can scale up to beta

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:33,120
bikes easily s you see the layer it can

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,410
be accessed by a pistol multiple

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:41,680
protocols are you sir

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:43,870
any seat sir lately what it does is

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,540
basically obligates different solar heat

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,089
quickly different storage experts from

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,120
different person give it in a single

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:54,250
namespace which is more reliable and

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,860
replicated or misty booted if there are

00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,850
multiple things maybe next later I will

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,610
talk about the best thing so big brick

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,850
is a basic component in overt in

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,550
Gloucester it's a actual place whereby

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:14,529
we will get data is getting stored

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:16,720
checked ilium 1.0 this later we have a

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,610
block device in the system and you

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,740
formerly you get a file system on it and

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,830
you mount it on your system and that

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,060
mount by becomes your brick brick is a

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:30,610
place where you were actual that is

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,110
getting stored and the limitation of the

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,140
brickies committee and the sister and

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,790
the system there is no limitation from

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,650
the Gloucester side whatever the week

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:43,660
can hold whatever much the amount of

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,640
data the brick and hold is completely

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,640
and up to the file system on this disk

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,240
Nexus the surface volume so this volume

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:58,209
is sexual collection of bricks as you

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,100
can see CDL rebates from different

00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:03,700
different fuels you can combine all this

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:07,330
goes coast and export them as a single

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,670
volume and rest of the supposed multiple

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,400
types of volumes called distribute or

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,800
Swiper replicate who takes distribute

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,529
where your data is distributed across

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,329
different bricks or how many field three

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,720
phase 2 alpha 1 value to file three in

00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:26,860
each won't go into different bricks so

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,040
that you can access them easily from

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,320
different hosts another ace replicate

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,730
the repeated is more reliable speccing

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,839
in case of virtualization other and

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,520
other other use cases where you need a

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,310
global data and you want to boost your

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,140
data at any cost there you can use a

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,889
replicate volume where you are ready

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,699
implicate

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:51,220
best bits the water file you write it in

00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:53,470
a volume is duplicated across all the

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,189
bricks in the volume at least get a

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,499
bigot looping it in three bricks also

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:03,160
you can combine them you can make

00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:05,199
distribute replicator you stripe or

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,600
other places like you can combine them

00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:10,509
in all of them another if Martinez can

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,369
hear is the quorum lesson after

00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:18,759
something support something called

00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:19,989
quorum so if you enable quorum you can

00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,119
avoid speed paint the speed paint

00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,220
anything you say you have three we

00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:26,919
assume one brief goes down or something

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,959
happens finally end up with three bricks

00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,019
having different debtors now you do not

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,359
know what is the final data actual data

00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:37,449
those cases can be avoided ec by quorum

00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:39,249
if you enable quorum when measure the

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,660
pics are not there it will automatically

00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:42,879
make the file system you'd only and you

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:49,119
can't write anything so that you can

00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:52,149
safely recover from your failure next

00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:55,809
this is DC this is how you access the

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:57,519
service call you improve use at least in

00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:00,459
virtualization case you have a few

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,230
original machines if you want the access

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,629
image from less nervous calling it goes

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,470
to general from currently das with the

00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:09,790
strippers fuse claim that that requests

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,410
the cluster bleep positioning on the

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,959
remote user per server through internet

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,999
through Nate and that again goes to

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,029
consciously underlying itself as file

00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:20,709
system if you see from here there are

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:24,939
lot of Colonel switches happening from

00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:28,929
user space to kernel space edifice which

00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:32,110
is here this is not performing well so

00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:36,519
what we have is we have something called

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:38,769
Lee gfap a support this helps you to

00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,529
communicate directly to the cluster

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:44,649
brief and get your one data so with this

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:47,919
with this cubicle it supports this is JP

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,809
APA with this the qme can directly talk

00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:54,819
to the gloucester of this week and get

00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:58,810
our imager volume data the surface later

00:13:54,819 --> 00:14:01,699
there is one burger 1rp missing in this

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,920
currently clear who supports only one

00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:07,279
coast though cluster of us is a

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,009
clustered by system currently qmo talks

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:15,290
to only one host if that Coast fails

00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:17,870
then your vm will get pass so we are

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,309
working on this bug for that if one that

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,870
caused fails even keel you must be able

00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:24,709
to talk to other hosts in the cluster to

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:29,809
get its volume back yes they are working

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:34,220
on this patch okay next is hyper

00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:38,089
converged I Becca much about setup you

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:42,259
see me let's compare this is the first

00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:45,499
one he had already goes here only for me

00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:49,639
engine other people over then separate

00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:53,029
storage and they signify seats but then

00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,329
gets up paper converged unique just

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:58,579
three rule and the same was will be used

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:01,970
for both storage as well as

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:04,160
virtualization this is very useful in

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,259
case of small scale deployments where

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,800
you go very limited set of hardware and

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:17,120
still you want to try out virtualization

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:19,819
techniques here we use the end both the

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,420
surface and Haley Munson will clean till

00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:24,649
notes and we use something called the

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,980
same thing what we explain the coastal

00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:29,180
engine so overt engine becomes

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,089
attainable automatically and runs inside

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,389
a vm that can manage the other VMS other

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:41,300
hyper oasis it can also manage the

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:43,490
surface volume and these boxes can be

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,889
standardized so that you can add you can

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,620
scale out a scale of usually can add

00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,749
more storage later two singles or you

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:55,089
can add vingi multiple an additional

00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,089
goes to scale out your setup

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:06,149
yeah busy so or acknowledged over just a

00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:09,749
set up next to you see you had to do

00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:13,079
some n else wants to bring to this the

00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:16,160
first converse gfap support does not

00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:20,970
bear now it's there since it's there and

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:25,319
replica 31 so if we easily especially to

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:27,300
over 30 when people tried hype hosted

00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,009
engine with the cluster they said the

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,600
reason we pick at two volumes and they

00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,850
get into split-brain situations and

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,040
split split pea situations are very

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,809
costly in over because when you go to

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,420
speed paint situation then your Williams

00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:43,350
are lost or at least past you have the

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,790
we book them are most of the cases here

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,769
to reboot they won't receive

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:53,100
automatically and sometimes feel

00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:55,379
corrupted data there are cases were same

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,069
vm running in different course there are

00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,319
multiple problems as I said they stopped

00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:03,209
supporting replica to volume and third

00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:05,579
supporting cluster office for hosted

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,350
engine in 3d at six it was enabled with

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,199
replicas three volume so you mad at Lee

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,449
as to where we get three volume but you

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,569
say plus gives lesser person worsted

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:18,740
engine now that support is there another

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,699
thing is called overthinking applies

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,490
defying the hosting setup is

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,159
traditionally it was very tough because

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,750
you are you have to solve this economic

00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,850
problem you have to boots up your

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,880
virtual machine which is going to render

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:37,799
hosted engine medium and high curvature

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,510
coast and over here had something called

00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,779
over there something i posted EG

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,159
deployment script that crypt reserved

00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,500
very interactive script but it task lot

00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:48,539
of postings it's all related goose teams

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,679
so if you make any mistakes in between

00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,220
then you have to start from beginning

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,140
and you have to clean up the setup even

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,610
weeks a set of issues but with this

00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,299
appliance model while they come up with

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,460
is you have a pre pre packaged divyam

00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:06,929
appliance which he has over already

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:10,220
installed can just use them in this

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:13,250
model you could avoid multiple errors

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,250
deployment also that VL can be

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,900
customized using clouding it basically

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,400
you have to convey a few things like

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,590
what should be the Epicurean name for

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,059
the vm what should be the username

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:27,110
password all those things you can easily

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:32,929
conceal and one more enhancement is the

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:36,650
self configuration previously the though

00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:38,480
there are three ho's and vm can run hi

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,730
hostel in GBM can run on any ghosts but

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,409
the conversation about the hosted engine

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,570
medium was sword separating all these

00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,880
three ghosts so if at all if you want to

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:51,080
change any to make any changes yo take

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,669
it same config fill in all the coast to

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,510
make a change to the coastal engineer

00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:58,100
now that is being said restore dinner in

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,710
the same storage the closed surface

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,140
storage our anniversary whatever he was

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,610
posted engine in that bed the

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:10,010
competition will be shared across all

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:12,860
the hosts and we have some mechanism to

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,299
upgrade from over 30 at five where the

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,980
conditions are separately storing all

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,130
the ghosts to move to the said

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,980
consideration and we have a management

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,140
dua so till now if you want to change

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,360
something in the overt engine vm like I

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,600
want to give more memory for the coastal

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,860
engine medium I want to change the

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
process of number of processes are

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,630
allocated then you have to edit the

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,770
country way but now we can do is to you

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,330
why but I came to know that this

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,789
features work and I lost the last week

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:47,840
was removed from theatrics but it be

00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:51,590
there in next photo to release ok what

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,220
are the main ingredients for I will

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:59,299
convert you just need three fiscal goes

00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:04,130
with her virtualization enabled then you

00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:06,559
need at least some 20 20 gb of memory 20

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,510
gb of storage space in your system

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,580
because we are going to run cluster

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,950
storage there and you are going to run

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,960
you up

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,200
that's very very me know if at all you

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,090
want to try it from a virtual machines

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,400
the seismic energy you need this minimum

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,140
requirements but in a place in the

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,810
hardware if you go to the hardware here

00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,230
I hope you hear much more capacity by

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:30,740
default the next thing but one thing is

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,490
you have to configure your DHCP

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,100
basically you have to reserve a mac

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,450
address forever hosted engine vm and

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,500
that mac mac address would be resolved

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:44,040
to a fixer IP and you should change you

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,220
should either confuses in dns to give a

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,030
predefined dns name for the type ii

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,950
because you are going to communicate

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,770
with the vm the hosted engine medium

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,780
using the same xq day and always so that

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,780
you have to make these configurations

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,220
next you have to just ensure the package

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:05,520
and the last point is very interesting

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,560
because you need fiscal consolidation

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,000
retro success lets us turn right but why

00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,130
do you need scream package it's because

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,660
since it early the bootstrapping the

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,050
hosted in j'ville you may sleep complex

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,790
and it involves multiple steps like

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,370
comparing your firewall and country in

00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:26,640
your network you may end up loosing your

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,890
connectivity to the city of server as a

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,500
result in further if you lose you have

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:35,870
to get back to the same session that can

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,870
be done through steam article control

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:44,420
next so how do you set up the first step

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,680
to settle the hypertunnel set of these

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,500
sitting up they were setting up your

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,050
cluster volume is I told me we need we

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,750
get three volumes so we have three other

00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,470
wizards make a cluster storage trusted

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:01,170
storage pull out of those three hosts

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,030
then create the three very plication vol

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,950
3 will be cover leave at least at least

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,990
one volume for now maybe later we can

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,370
gain another volume the one volume will

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,380
be used for Costa ding ding William

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:14,250
which will contain the disk image for

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:16,860
the coast a ninja medium another volume

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,160
will be used for regular williams which

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,690
you are going to create and as I already

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,460
told you we have to enable cluster

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,770
quorum

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,610
you may get into plus split-brain

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:31,320
situations another important feature is

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,750
sorry this was recently introduced in

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,700
Gloucester so we thought this feature we

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:41,039
were facing many problems with the self

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:44,100
heal when Sylvia he'll happens it heats

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,440
up the whole CPU time and your VMS are

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:51,630
not getting any cpu and VMS are getting

00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:54,600
past as a result either we have to

00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:57,029
restart the VMS are ya yet reset the

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,399
real and especially in case of either

00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:02,039
converged case even your hosted engine

00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:03,720
william will get past so it's kind of

00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:08,130
difficult situation to recover from the

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,020
condition but if you enable sorry your

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,700
big files your disk image space each

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,270
other anyway are going to be big will be

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,309
stipend into multi not psyched little

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,710
different from normal sniping will be

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:21,960
jumping into different chunks of I 12

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,110
you can terrible size by default we can

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,029
we use fight or MBSR it will make

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,039
Chunkin into firefighter LM each our

00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:32,309
hearts of hearts and would be stored in

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,260
different breeds so the shell field and

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,240
it paid to improve the self field

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:41,520
performance and as well as 0 performance

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:44,279
we tried it year of the skull and it

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,500
actually solves the cpu problem now with

00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,919
the cell field we are not see see more

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,200
cpu usage created a few more tuning like

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,620
setting the network timeout and silky

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,390
algorithm and the Ovid group said the

00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:05,970
warning setting the one Eddie and Eddie

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:07,620
23 yard 636 sorry there should be GID ok

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:12,510
next thing is the worst arranged in

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,370
setup is it eroded we need these three

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:18,299
packages only stove overton appliance

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,730
which brings in the OVA image a roasted

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,500
engine image next is hosted in him set

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,820
up that brings in the hosting setup

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,640
script which helps you with to bootstrap

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,110
William hosted in the medium next video

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,590
some cluster which brings in all the

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:37,090
variation packages then this is our

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,640
friend the host an engine deployed

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,980
if you run the script it is a very

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,800
interactive script task multiple

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,450
questions and these are the few

00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,970
important questions which will be asked

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,640
one is the storage type here the two

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,280
storage time when you are play another

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,620
the surface volume name with the coast

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:59,140
if you do that next it will ask you how

00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,090
you want to bootstrap your vm there are

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,160
three options either you can use movie

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,010
image or you can use a cd-rom or you can

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,450
use pixie boot but essentially using

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,590
movie image is the easiest and better

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:14,080
way so choose ova image next thing you

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:17,110
can do some customization to the vm

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,440
through cloud in it and it supports the

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,640
script suppose supports aunty one

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,800
creation of cloud raining combination

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:28,750
where you can specify the etherion name

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:30,820
and the root user password etc also you

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,370
have to give the mac address for the vm

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,590
sneak which you have reserved reserved

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:39,640
in your digits consider in your dhcp

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:42,510
server if you want more details or

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,820
accept commands please read my blog i

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,790
have written this blog to help you with

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,580
the deployment that that covers all the

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:55,840
details except sequence of commands what

00:25:51,580 --> 00:26:01,000
you have to run what you attention so

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,740
once you do this what it is you have

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,020
hosted a medium running you can log into

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:09,090
the overt engine you can see a cluster

00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:13,870
with one coast where you run the street

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:16,590
so now the next step is enabling cluster

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:19,060
service so by default also really

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,150
doesn't enable cursor service for the

00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,580
cluster further further cluster where

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,640
it's being deployed so you get enabled

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,780
cluster service for the cluster next you

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,750
have to add the remaining two goes to

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,320
the setup and create another storage

00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:40,140
domain where you will create your vm see

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,140
any questions yani clear

00:26:53,870 --> 00:27:00,140
you in this ping timeout these are

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,190
volume contains the still volume of sums

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,100
after creating volume you can set these

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,299
up some set basically these are all

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,880
volume of some cinna brings lesser

00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:17,760
quorum and enabling sodding service or

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:21,210
volume options yeah so how do you enable

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,100
cluster cluster was integrated with over

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,559
I think cream since three dad one for a

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:29,610
long time currently you can manage your

00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:31,470
whole cluster deployment using overt the

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,630
fiber garages case we care a cluster

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,299
where you want to rent both overton

00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:39,000
cluster so by default I think it should

00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,860
be fixed in overt by default doesn't

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,390
enable crystal service so you had to go

00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,200
and eat the cluster to enable cluster

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,520
service if you enable cluster service

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,880
then he totally takes care of boost

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,320
bootstrapping your cluster coast like

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,049
managing your firewall managing the

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,210
cluster d service it also supports

00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:59,460
volume management you can create your

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,130
volumes you can start stop or you can

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:07,289
add brits rebalance it supports almost

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,730
all the cluster operations and you can

00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:11,309
use the same recipe which is expressed

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:15,659
by overt to all do all your volume a

00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:17,190
column operation though we trusted web

00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,100
series for the scene cluster there is

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,429
one problem we go over because the world

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,049
doesn't consider that its investor the

00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:28,679
service is running in this coast when it

00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:32,280
does some when it just fencing our other

00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:37,380
power related operations what happens is

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:40,110
if you enable power or management for a

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,720
host and if that coast is not reachable

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:45,960
for some time for some reason it will

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,789
reboot the host may not be required in

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,340
case of bluster case but still it will

00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:51,600
reboot because it is up considering the

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,360
fact that the host is running the

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,960
surface

00:28:52,360 --> 00:29:00,170
this has to be fixed next thing is

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,690
adding additional hosts since we are

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,120
done with the first host and we are boot

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,470
shaft of a most challenging medium only

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,440
thing remaining is adding the remaining

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,000
to host to the cluster just go on air

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,000
and the cluster in the address early

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,280
will be a chick bugs saying do you want

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,810
to make this a supposed to be an agent

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,080
you want to come play virtual engine

00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:22,640
Agent P say yes then it will can't hear

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,640
the was sitting in a agent on this coast

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,950
as well but this way was removed for

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,980
some reason the last movie gives up some

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,410
bugs so again the host is needed by if

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,320
your friend which can be used to an

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,870
additional worst how could a second was

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,940
and the same script this time it won't

00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,830
ask you so much questions only there you

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,030
have to give the same volume if you do

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,520
that then I thought about you take care

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,770
of most of the things now your second

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,280
verster there similarly can add the

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,660
third worst now you have three lives in

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,240
the cluster which are running both

00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:02,330
cluster and wet services next is clearly

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,490
storage from cluster they already told

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,470
you what supports cluster deployment

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,580
cluster management you can create your

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:12,310
volumes in / digital either through

00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,890
weapon will hotel are through a list API

00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:17,750
it's suppose it supports other cluster

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,090
features like volume profiling capacity

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,340
monitoring Giroux bridges and volumes

00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:29,060
are almost everything whatever is there

00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:30,650
in the cluster next thing is still

00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,900
adding the storage domain using the

00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,940
cluster plus column so now that we have

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,720
created a volume which will be used for

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,420
other regular Williams you have to

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,940
create a storage domain using this

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:47,149
cluster this volume here the important

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,789
point is this one

00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:51,320
going to be the volume path and you have

00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:54,109
to give the mount options with a backup

00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,820
Alpha server this will be used to

00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:59,330
communicate this will be used to count

00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,089
together over that so that when the main

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:06,849
was this phase host one fails it could

00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:13,580
talk to those two to our host tree so

00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:15,859
this is really required this is called

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:19,669
so we have their of this dashboard sau a

00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:22,399
plug-in overt mostly from actually we

00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:25,039
get a dashboard for cluster which takes

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,499
care about this till later entities now

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,039
we have included virtual machine bus

00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:32,450
also there and this you see a complete

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,849
picture of what's happening in your

00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,999
deployment like how we are doing with a

00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:40,339
capacity like how much storage you have

00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:42,710
in total how much is used how much is

00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:44,869
free and how we are doing with the CPU

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,969
and memory utilization that's our age

00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:50,089
out of all the hosts and how is a

00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:53,299
network traffic and how many ghosts are

00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:54,830
up on how many in maintenance and how we

00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:57,859
already doing with the volume adjuster

00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:00,549
volumes we have some different states in

00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:03,830
the vessel volumes like Molly can job

00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:06,320
and while it can be done thats normal p

00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:09,859
or something does d created what's

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,509
degraded is a replica to three volume if

00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:13,759
one big ghost until your data is

00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:15,799
available but it's kind of degraded you

00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,359
are not able to access another mode you

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,149
have only two notes serving the data

00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,369
that's degraded he or something called

00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:26,179
pass here we're in a distributed volume

00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:28,460
if you lose one node and one brick your

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,349
parcel that your data is partially

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,359
available not fully available that is

00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:35,779
called partial you should see those

00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:38,989
statuses when that happens also virtual

00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:40,549
machines you can see here you for some

00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:43,159
reason if your network is broken we

00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:49,249
should see some nicks down or something

00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:50,200
similar there this is quite useful so

00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:52,369
next

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,629
how do you manage your hosted engine I

00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:56,450
think he talked about a little bit about

00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:58,940
it you can change your questioning the

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:02,600
medium confidence like memory and CPU

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,580
location and network configurations 3y

00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,639
but currently it's not supported I think

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:12,409
it should be inferred auto fill it too

00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:14,299
sister said storage when you changed

00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:16,460
something then when the worst eryngium

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:22,490
restarted got a mixed up accept the new

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:27,049
continued segment in society next thing

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:29,600
is hosted engine management so in

00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:31,399
question engine you can configure a few

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,559
things like the state transition Mason

00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:36,919
teaching these things are very important

00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,019
because you're overthinking Sevilla what

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,990
happens for some reason the vm dies and

00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:44,240
you could add you more you may not know

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,799
that um right yum is not running the

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,809
ocean in genomic selfies are training

00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,779
which means you are not monitoring the

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,749
you are not managing the whole setup but

00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:56,240
but in hostel engine you can configure

00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:58,220
your mail address so when whenever the

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,529
Williams take changes then it goes to

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,450
down from up are up to down or any state

00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:06,429
changes you will get a mail notification

00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:08,690
saying gay and I is going down it's up

00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:10,129
that day you are being elected that

00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,770
something happened something wrong

00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:15,200
happens also you can contain other

00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:18,139
things like climb out and the house

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,260
hosts scoring the scoring Coast chorus

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,270
used to define where the hostage in

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,520
Williams would run for example you have

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,710
different host in the among three was

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,500
one of those is highly powerful other to

00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:33,109
go sir not they have less CPU or less

00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,059
memory then the higher power hosts will

00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:37,750
get the highest score and it will run

00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:37,750
the coastal engineer

00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,980
also we did few enhancements recently on

00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:52,909
his class of a sudden we talked about it

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:56,120
another is arbitral you actually to try

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,490
out this hyper college is set up we know

00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,590
need three volume we know needle three

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:04,640
ghosts it could be done with the two was

00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:07,100
itself but for replica the volume we

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,830
need the three worst that can be easily

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,650
solved with our meter volume where the

00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,950
third brick will not be a in case of

00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:20,930
triplicate three the third brake will be

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:22,370
used only for meta latest purpose when

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,560
he store a file in Arabic a three-volume

00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,840
normal it goes it gets stolen all the

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,700
three bricks but in an arbitral volume

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,490
only the intact bring only me tonight i

00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:35,930
stood not the actual data so that can be

00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:38,090
a relation capacity the machine insert

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:41,870
will not be a s the night declare the

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:44,510
same capacity as other machines another

00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:47,750
asleep replaced brick this is important

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:50,420
because if you want to replace or node

00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:53,740
in the coastal region set up currently

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:57,980
it's difficult you have to do some

00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:00,170
manual steps in the cluster to replace

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,420
the code now what we are trying is here

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,370
that should be dual from the UI itself

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,380
you can automatically bring it and you

00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:09,230
knew were scurvy with a replacement for

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:12,110
a word to failing host it will be done

00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:14,660
to you i know without CLI any any usage

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,400
of tli and the backup work wale support

00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,040
in liberty and key in which he talked

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,520
about the next station will be focusing

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:27,920
more about these terms that's all i have

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:30,460
today i hope you understood any

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,460
questions

00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:48,140
used for something like that I think

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,360
when it cluster of us by default doesn't

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,790
use much CPU I feel that's why i think

00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,040
we are running some tests we didn't see

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,680
any major performance issues with those

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,750
things the main polymers with the self

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,180
field and self children's we used to

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,410
seem more performance issues but with

00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,930
the sodding that that is also getting

00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:09,380
reduced you don't see any major

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:11,390
performance bottleneck regency but still

00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,370
it's here in evaluation state you're

00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:34,790
running some performance tips not even

00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:37,280
with our volumes currently it's our

00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,440
their current leader that's why we

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,120
recommend not containing power

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,120
management in case of Viper converged

00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,640
any other questions

00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,810
thank you

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,960
what

00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:11,160
nice work a girl you can

00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:13,580
how can i how can do it but now I never

00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,580
gone no no

00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,580
here

00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,740
so you can you can talk

00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,130
you can give

00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,239
and that is somewhat with you need

00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,630
