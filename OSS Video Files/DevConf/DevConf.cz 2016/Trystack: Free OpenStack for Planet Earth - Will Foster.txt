Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	The OpenStack Foundation and several generous corporate sponsors (including Red Hat, Dell, Cisco, and NetApp) have
deployed TryStack.org, a free way for folks to learn more about OpenStack and it's capabilities. TryStack is a
public, production OpenStack instance and the maintainers have learned a great deal about maintenance, upgrades,
automation and gotchas around running a large public cloud on RDO OpenStack and RHEL.

In this talk we will cover: 
路 The history of Trystack 
路 Give insight into deployment architecture and underlying components
路 Demonstration of the various capabilities of TryStack
路 Talk about the roadmap of how TryStack is evolving with OpenStack 

You will leave this session with lots of free OpenStack and a greater 
appreciation for what it takes to maintain a frequently upgraded OpenStack 
deployment utilized by the general public.
