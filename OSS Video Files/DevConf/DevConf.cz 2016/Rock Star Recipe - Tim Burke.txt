Description: 
	Becoming an engineering rock star isnâ€™t just luck. Rather its a combination of passion, skills, role and environment.  Most people fail to recognize that they have the potential to be a rock star. This talk describes proven approaches you can follow to get there, if you
sincerely want to and are up for the challenge.

technical university here for this great

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,910
venue we've promised them that we will

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,000

with that I will hand over to Tim my

00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:00,370
boss and my friend and so as you might

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,139
have arise we're doing two keynote and I

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,510
was just telling him that he's doing the

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,190
corporate redhead keynote and the

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,510
unwieldy birds doing the more open

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:19,600
source even but I don't think that's

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:22,819
true we'll see maybe if I turned it on

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,059
it would work better was that all right

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:27,379
step at a time all right Thank You Radek

00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,059
first of all I want to thank the Brno

00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:31,339
team they're always extremely hospitable

00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,559
and they put on a great event so I know

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,269
we haven't proved it yet we'll see how

00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,369
good it goes but I'm really grateful to

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,829
radicand the whole Brno team for pulling

00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:41,629
this together so this is a new

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,879
presentation for me I wrote it just for

00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:46,009
this conference it's different usually

00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:49,369
when I do these keynotes it's more of a

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:50,809
technical roadmap but this one's not at

00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,729
all a technical roadmap but something

00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:55,129
different and so I really appreciate

00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:56,809
feedback if you see me in the hallways

00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:58,519
later or something tell me you know you

00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:01,939
liked it it's off to anything you know

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,769
just any feedback is welcome okay so

00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:06,019
what we're going to talk about this

00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,629
presentation it's I just wrote it's

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:12,439
called rockstar recipe so what it's

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:15,199
about it's about proven approaches that

00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:17,179
I've seen by dealing with thousands of

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:20,029
Engineers literally thousands in my

00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:22,189
career and I've tried to do it's

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,989
basically a top ten list i got like 10

00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:25,100
slides that show like what are some of

00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:27,859
the attributes what are the behaviors

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,229
what do I think makes a really awesome

00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:32,509
engineer and you know most of the stuff

00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:34,999
isn't even particular to engineers it's

00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:39,049
generic it applies to pretty much anyone

00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:42,169
and why you know why should you care

00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:47,389
right what's what's good about this it's

00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:49,100
that it's any it's about it because what

00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:52,309
you it's about your career it's about

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,259
people who are happy and enjoy doing

00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:57,259
what they're doing and are good at it

00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:58,909
are you know they enjoy life better

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,819
they're more pleasant when they go home

00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:03,769
you know to their families think about

00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:06,139
how much time you spend at work with you

00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:07,729
know whether it's online or you know

00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,399
directly in the office with other people

00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:12,439
so you know you're important it's worth

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,629
doing it right so I just want to to pass

00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:19,789
this along and so what You Know Who am I

00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:22,579
what what Craig do I have with you guys

00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:26,299
right so I've been a kernel developer a

00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:28,129
Java program or a cluster program and

00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:30,559
architect so before I became a manager I

00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:33,439
used to do some real work so but not

00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,540
only that but I've seen you know I don't

00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:38,610
claim to be a rockstar myself but I've

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,200
but had the privilege of working with a

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,570
lot of them and there's some rock stars

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,580
in this room and so you know just like

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,530
open source it's like pass it on maybe

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,020
you can learn from what others are doing

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,830
and you know and build on that so that's

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:56,430
the whole point of this talk so first

00:12:52,830 --> 00:13:00,000
slide a lot of people think that it's

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,770
their manager's job to tell them what

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,590
they what to do what their career should

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:07,740
be in every step they should make but

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,720
you know honestly your managers do want

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,870
to help but nobody should care more

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,200
about you and your career than yourself

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,420
right and so a lot of people think that

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,850
you know you take a job and you know you

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,450
might read a job description that job

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,400
was not written just for you right

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,080
because everyone's different everyone

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,850
brings different strengths to the job

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,610
and so the first thing I would say is

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,430
that one thing you can do when you take

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,220
a job is to tailor the role so if I

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,570
Taylor I mean tweak it not just like say

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,000
hey I took this job and I'm not doing

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,670
any of that right it might be like hey

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,680
there's some things that that I'm good

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,690
at that i can do i can i can write auto

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,430
tests i can be good at adding

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,740
documentation i can improve the

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,540
usability i can integrate it with better

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,940
with other components so it's all about

00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,630
creativity add your own ideas to what

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,330
your job is the other thing is when it

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,370
comes to your job that's how people

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,500
perceive you that's how they view you

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,260
and so they view you through two main

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,030
ways one is your output you know whether

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,560
it's your code your documentation your

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,770
testing its really what you do and

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,410
that's important but also your

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:22,800
perception is really a lot based on your

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,870
interaction style are you somebody that

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,910
people like to work with and that's what

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,920
a lot of the other the rest of these

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,020
slides really talk about is more

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:36,870
interaction style and what I find really

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:41,790
makes a successful engineer so in your

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:44,190
job it's important to care about what

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,770
you do so if you don't like what you're

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,140
doing then don't do it really you're not

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,950
doing anyone any favor like the worst

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,020
thing is to have

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,820
somebody miserable in their job it's not

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,190
good for the person doing it it's not

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,080
nobody wants to be with them so care

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,120
about what you do in you know the

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,860
fortunate thing in our industry there's

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,590
so much opportunity there's so many

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,150
different roles this you know even a red

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,530
hat we have so many different products

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,540
and stuff if you don't like what you're

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:12,570
doing go on a different team that's the

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,670
cool thing we all have we all know what

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,770
garbage in garbage out means in

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,320
computing right it's like you you know

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,510
throw-in crap for inputs and you'll get

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,390
crab for outputs right well it's the

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:26,160
same with your job if you don't take if

00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,110
you don't care if you don't really put

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,620
quality into it you're not going to get

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:34,470
quality out and it's not just about you

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,500
know the code it's about your

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,090
satisfaction your enjoyment and you know

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,520
one thing I'll get back to later it's

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,620
it's not to get like to philosophical

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,780
about it but you know when it comes to

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,790
liking what you do like it's really

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,220
about the journey it's like you know

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,770
you're never done it's you know you can

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,360
always learn and grow so you might as

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:59,250
well enjoy what you're doing along the

00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,350
way now next point is breath is an

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,300
option to death a lot of people think

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:07,410
that the best way to be a rock star is

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:09,840
to do one thing like your whole career

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,910
for a long time and just stick with that

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,280
and that's fine because that you know

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,330
that's one approach because it keep in

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,740
mind like these things or not um did not

00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,060
everything works for everyone so it's

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,400
like pick and choose what works for you

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:27,240
but what some people often don't

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,980
recognize is that breath or having

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,160
expertise and a lot of different topics

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,280
that's really valuable too because there

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,450
are frankly in our industry it's harder

00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:41,100
to find people who have a lot of have a

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,610
lot of experience in different areas

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:47,100
than people who are narrow but to do

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,960
something different it takes some

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,550
courage right you have to get out of

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,110
your comfort zone you have to be willing

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,850
to do something different and so it's

00:16:54,110 --> 00:17:00,570
you have to be willing to to stretch and

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,790
grow and growth isn't just technical

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,510
skills so it's not like hey I'm doing

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,620
colonel device

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:09,240
drivers today and i'll do a networking

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,180
layer tomorrow that's one form of

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,670
technical growth but true rock stars

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:19,040
don't just grow technically they grow

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:22,860
and non-technical skills so things like

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,970
organizing a project or being good with

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,130
support and we'll get into those things

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,680
so it's not just the technical skills

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:34,260
that make up a rock star and when people

00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:36,570
move I say it's not it's often not a

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,520
lateral movement what a lateral move is

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,280
I mean sometimes you could be like the

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,740
authority or the expert once one topic

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,110
on one subsystem when you move over to a

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,910
different team you're probably not going

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,890
to be the expert on that team right and

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,980
so sometimes within a career you have to

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,480
let go down to go up because you can you

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,640
know the more you learn the more you can

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,730
grow and and so it may look like you're

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,830
taking a you know step down or but you

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,050
know when you add all those up it's

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:09,420
really like you're getting to higher and

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:12,690
higher places as you go nobody likes

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:16,170
trolls so you know a lot of people think

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,840
that hey I'm a tough guy right I'm going

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,450
to be that guy on the mail list who just

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,330
Snipes it everything you know and they

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,220
think like you know I'm awesome and you

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,780
know people look my peers are really

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,940
looking up to me because they think I'm

00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,950
standing up to everyone you know what

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,890
you look like a jerk you really do if

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,170
you do that right so what's better you

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:40,170
know rock stars don't do that what rock

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,570
stars do is there more problem solvers

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,780
so rather than saying oh that'll never

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:48,930
work or that's you know stupid and stuff

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,730
like that they propose ideas they say

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,710
you know okay hey that's a good approach

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,570
you had but how about you know if we

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,120
tweaked it this way and stuff like that

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,880
so being a problem solver that's what

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,250
rock stars are all about the other thing

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,620
is trolls don't listen right all they do

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:10,830
is up their output only devices you know

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:13,590
and so what you need to do is you rock

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,590
stars basically it's almost like a

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,830
tenant of open source it's like you you

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,690
know

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,640
you take stuff that already exists and

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,340
you can build from it and so that's what

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,390
you know rock stars do is they're able

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,740
to hear and listen to what others say

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:32,090
sort of like start with their approach

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,250
and an augment and build build on it and

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:38,519
to be a rock star it's just as important

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,500
how you say it then what you say and it

00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,230
often it's more important how you say it

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,570
because a lot of people when there's

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,740
this a tendency like on mail lists and

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:52,860
stuff like that for people to be more

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:57,000
abrasive or more terse and not really

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,940
show respect for others and so you know

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,720
true rock stars really show respect for

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,360
other people and last point I have is

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,159
avoid slamming groups sometimes people

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,470
say like Oh everyone on that team sucks

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:16,230
don't trust any of them they're all bad

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,000
you know that's not really helpful often

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,919
I hear it as a manager I'm usually in

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,730
that category right don't trust them

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,490
right so but the truth is anytime you're

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,230
slamming a whole group it probably means

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,679
you're being a troll you know because

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,450
seriously yeah not all groups are super

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,590
awesome but you know there's there's

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:43,950
good people in in all teams next point

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:47,130
is human touch so as geeks you know it's

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:51,210
really easy to do everything online you

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:54,750
know IRC email whatever Twitter all this

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:57,299
stuff right but what we find is

00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:00,929
seriously you can get so much more done

00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:03,120
sometimes by doing it the old-fashioned

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:07,169
way talking to people you know picking

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,970
up the phone you know going to a

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:11,429
conferences like we are right now def

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,200
comp is an awesome example because you

00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:15,690
know people often say it's the hallway

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,340
track that's the best you know not the

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,429
presentations but just getting to talk

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,789
to other people so you know that stuff

00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:25,620
is more valuable because you don't you

00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:27,080
may not realize it you know whether you

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,840
go to the you know stub

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,179
no brewery thing and stuff like that you

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,070
know that party it's just you're

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:35,720
establishing bonds and connections with

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,179
people that you don't even realize it at

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,360
the time but trust me it really means a

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:44,179
lot and makes you much more effective so

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,470
rock stars can tend to be more social I

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:49,250
guess is a word to put it there not

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:51,679
completely introverts another point is

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,320
you don't always have to get in the last

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,539
word this is I see this often with

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,789
people who are more junior in their

00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:01,240
career so you're on a mail list it's

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:04,340
like somebody you know does it reply and

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,590
you always have to have like the last

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,490
reply so you just keep going and going

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:14,029
and going and it never stops you know

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:17,510
sometimes it's better just to let things

00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:19,100
you know flame out or to you know if you

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,049
don't have anything constructive to say

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,899
don't don't feel like you have to get in

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:25,610
there and just keep twisting the screws

00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:27,169
on it you know it's like has a lot of

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,679
its really you know talk with people

00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:33,799
inside trying to get them to you know

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,019
it's a common understanding and just be

00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:37,880
willing to say that you don't have to

00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,700
win all the time because it's really

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,169
about it's not if you can talk with

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,870
somebody on the side or in other ways

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:48,019
and help shape their ideas it's often

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:52,700
more successful to indirectly get your

00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:54,500
points across teams are better than

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,470
individuals teams get much more done

00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,830
than individuals that's like often the

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,320
term rock star you think of like one

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,809
person like up on the stage you know

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,279
like a solo performance and so that's

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,870
why I think rock stars is a little bit

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,919
of a misnomer whereas I think it's more

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:14,659
like a soccer team or football team that

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:20,059
we guys call it you know that that's a

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:24,260
better analogy and it's clear that the

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:28,429
smartest person of people can do much

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:32,149
more than one smart guy or a one smart

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:34,850
woman so it's really how do you rock

00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:38,389
stars are good at working together with

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,850
other people and so in that sense it's

00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:44,030
not winner take all it's

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:47,180
not one person has to win and someone

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:49,940
has to lose it's really about how do we

00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,310
work together as a team and another

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,440
point is sharing mentoring and growing

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:58,610
so some people think in their careers

00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,470
that that their best strategy is to be

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,030
the only guy who knows something it's

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:06,560
like hey I'm the only one who knows the

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:09,410
subsystem they can't fire me you know

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,570
but I call that like a monopolist

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,270
someone who has to hold all the toys

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:17,090
right but something someone like that

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,430
never becomes a rockstar because they

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,820
never get out of that toy box they never

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,770
play in a team on a bigger field so if

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:30,290
you want to be a rock star you got to

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:34,190
share your toys that's the point walking

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,960
the walk so you can't expect more from

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:42,140
others than they're willing to do

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:44,570
yourself so you know if if you're nasty

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,990
to people on the mail list people aren't

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:53,840
going to be good to you in return if you

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:55,550
if you you know if you don't try to do

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,320
things like you know if you're the first

00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,570
one to leave that the day you know if

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,940
you're not working very much then you

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,010
know you can't if you're any form of

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,590
team leader or something like that it's

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,600
like you have to be willing to help

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,900
other people on your team out in other

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,920
ways like you know whether it's not

00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:18,350
enough help to test or try stuff out you

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,510
know review the documentation see if you

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:24,710
can follow the steps and get this these

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:27,290
things to work and what you also as part

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,260
of walking is that people are not the

00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,790
same so people come into projects with

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,400
different skills so there were some

00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,460
people who are awesome testing there are

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,090
some people who are better at

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,860
documentation there are people are

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,960
better about community building and

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,630
stuff like that so walking the walk

00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,050
means that you know treating people with

00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:50,420
respect be willing to you know work hard

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,310
and set a good example and to recognize

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,950
that people bring different talents

00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,170
open source would not be successful

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,870
without different talents you know

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,790
whether it's people doing storage or

00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,500
people doing middleware and stuff like

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,870
that that's the reason it's succeeding

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,870
it's because people walking together

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:15,710
rock stars are always customer focused

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,960
so some people think that the customer

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,360
is the enemy like you hear like man my

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,950
job would be so much easier if these

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,840
customers weren't submitting these

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:27,410
stupid bug reports or stuff like that

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:31,010
you know but you know as far as I'm

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,900
concerned developing software and

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:36,530
delivering products something's only

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,930
useful if people use it like I think you

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,120
know linux open source hugely successful

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,880
right used by millions of people

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,910
millions of you know varieties of

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,060
applications that's awesome so if you

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,500
just code stuff and nobody uses it as

00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,480
far as I'm concerned it doesn't exist

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,950
it's that's actic that's an academic

00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,890
exercise so for customer focus it's you

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,530
want to try to first thing is install

00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:06,740
and run your your your code like I know

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:10,070
people who are sometimes they'll they do

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:12,500
like this one small component but that's

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,130
part of a bigger application right and

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,480
they'll say you know but they don't even

00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,970
know how to install and run their

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,110
product because all i can do is like

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:28,460
their own little you know tiny piece and

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:31,430
so rock stars no have an appreciation

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,010
for how easy is it to install your stuff

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,830
how easy is it to use it they have a

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,230
sense of they talk with like the support

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,140
team to understand what are the inputs

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,940
they're getting from the customers

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,360
support teams add valuable experiences

00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,040
in terms of how this stuff is received

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,900
or you know what the customer

00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,020
experiences is so it's extremely

00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:57,380
important and as part of that in order

00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:59,800
to prepare your code that it works in

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:03,470
the first place is that developing

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,799
automated unit tests are a core part

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:08,600
of developers job so in the old days in

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,850
the bad old days people would think hey

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,669
I'm a developer I'm going to throw it

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,870
over the wall the guys in QE you're

00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:17,210
going to write the test and it's all

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:20,510
going to be awesome but you know that's

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,370
that separation just doesn't work now

00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,110
fortunately these days we have much more

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,830
collaboration between QE and the

00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:30,470
developers but rock stars are people and

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:33,159
teams who develop automated unit tests

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:37,010
that do like see I testing up front so

00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,960
don't think that automated unit tests

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,520
are not part of your job because they

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,280
are and that's what it takes to be a

00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:49,760
rock star managers don't have magic wand

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:54,289
so people come to me all the time say

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:57,919
hey I need you know twice as much travel

00:28:54,289 --> 00:29:00,140
budget and I need you know to hire twice

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,200
as many people and it's like yeah

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,320
awesome everybody does right and so you

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,580
got to recognize that we don't have

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,530
infinite budgets so you know we have

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,049
finite constraints that we have to deal

00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,580
with but but that doesn't mean don't

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,110
ever talk to your managers that's not

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,760
the point because managers like to talk

00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,740
to people and get that input of what's

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,350
going well and what's not but instead of

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,390
coming to your manager with demands come

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,490
to your manager with ideas it might be

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,950
like hey I know we got a lot of stuff

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,230
going on there's too much we can't I

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,570
can't get all this done is it alright if

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,150
we focus our priorities on this stuff

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,100
here and you know we do less of that

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,140
stuff so that's get an idea of like a

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,210
trade-off proposal that's the type of

00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:44,600
thing that you that work well to discuss

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,610
with managers also phased approaches it

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,650
might be like look you can't do

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,690
everything all at once so just talk

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,909
about okay let's start with this you

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,070
know this will be phase one then we'll

00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:57,799
do you know phase two later so it's

00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:00,740
really about you know coming up with

00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,230
ideas and being creative as opposed to

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:06,740
just trying to dump your problems in

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:11,150
somebody else's lap and raise issues

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:13,880
early so honestly manages want to like

00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:16,920
to find out about problems in like the

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,380
release early rather than often like

00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,450
people often say oh you know at the end

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,850
when we're doing the code freeze someone

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,980
will say oh well we're you know we're

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,470
way behind on it and it's like well did

00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,780
you know that a month ago yeah we knew

00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:33,090
that a month ago so bring it up because

00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,130
that allows your managers to help maybe

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,930
you know shift some more people on to

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:42,480
help that you know the trouble spots and

00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:45,780
things like that they're rock stars are

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,180
it's amazing how much more productive

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,220
some people can be than others seriously

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,620
there are like I put up here that

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,910
productive people can be three times

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:59,550
more productive than the average person

00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:01,470
I think that's I think it's it could

00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,780
even be more than that so you know true

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:07,080
rock stars it's just amazing what they

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:09,660
can get accomplished and there are rock

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,700
stars in every discipline so rock stars

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,750
are not just coders there's rock stars

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,150
in program managers who like coordinate

00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:21,270
things people like scrum masters there's

00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:24,360
does rock stars and support so these

00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:27,840
principles can be applied to anybody in

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,930
any of them and one thing I found is

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,490
that leadership and coordination is one

00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:38,370
of the hardest to find talents in in our

00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,530
industry so some so what I would

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,450
encourage there is for career

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,820
advancement like you don't have to go to

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,460
the dark side and become a manager

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,890
that's not completely necessary but

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,910
there's a lot of opportunities for like

00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:55,200
technical leaves it might say hey let's

00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,420
someone you'll start with in the

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,460
development team coordinating the effort

00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,070
so working with like two or three other

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,840
people to to get something big or done

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:08,730
or you might another way is to join to

00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,550
go to meetings for another team like say

00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,830
there's other layers that call your your

00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,750
software so become familiar with what

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,930
those other teams do and those are

00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:21,540
examples of leadership so don't be

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,850
afraid to to try and get out that

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,980
because I'm telling you it's always a

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,800
scare skill so it's always going to be

00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,640
in demand for people who can who can do

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,140
that in a cooperative way

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,570
and so rock stars typically are people

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,110
who combine most of the attributes

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:44,260
within this within this presentation so

00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:46,360
last one less of the 10 things before i

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,570
get to summary is what i call the career

00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:56,920
unicorn and that is it's the difference

00:32:49,570 --> 00:33:00,220
between a job and a passion so if you

00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,390
can find a job where it's not

00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,220
you're not just punching the clock

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,740
you're not just doing it to pay the

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,660
mortgage or or your student loans or

00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,120
your car bills but it's something you

00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:14,950
really want to do that's really special

00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:18,250
and I think that open source provides us

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:21,010
all a really unique opportunity to try

00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:24,600
to land a unicorn job so take for

00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:27,940
example you know people work in linux

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,070
open sores it's used in so many

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,320
different ways there's whether it was

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,750
you know things like the one laptop per

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:40,420
child initiative that was trying to get

00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:42,340
computers to low-income people in

00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,860
countries you know there's a lot of what

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,950
we do it's more than just we're not just

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,170
selling stuff right we're making we're

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,330
transforming the industry we're making a

00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:54,610
lot of things happen beyond just our

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,260
company of course you know you want to

00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,330
contribute to your company you want to

00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,760
align your efforts with your company but

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,770
open source is a truly unique way to do

00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,590
so much more than that and that's why I

00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:09,390
think you know we're really in a unique

00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:14,290
profession because it's not just a job

00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:17,110
so in summary this there's no one right

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,850
answer for everyone it's not like do

00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,560
this do this do that and then you'll be

00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,060
a rock star because there's different

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,570
rock stars in different ways to get

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:28,750
there but what this shows is that rock

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:31,240
stars typically like what they do they

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,010
care they bring passion to their job so

00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,860
they're not doing garbage in there

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:39,340
putting passion in you put passion in

00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:42,629
and you get rock star out that's really

00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,409
how it goes rock stars are team players

00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:45,639
they're not trolls

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:48,220
they don't just snipe they really

00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:52,210
propose good alternatives good solutions

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:55,059
and they have the courage to grow to

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,490
step out of their comfort zone to try

00:34:55,059 --> 00:35:02,500
something different to help out other

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:05,170
people and rock stars they can through

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,740
there are examples they can truly be

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:12,130
inspirational to others and the thing is

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:14,440
that most people think oh I'm not a rock

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,799
star I can't do that so all this stuff

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,589
doesn't apply to me but the thing is

00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:22,900
people can it's like you it's easy to

00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:26,319
not think that you have what it takes to

00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:31,329
get there but really all it takes is you

00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:34,030
know playing well with others growing

00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:38,309
respecting other people and trying to

00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:41,680
challenge yourself in new dimensions so

00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:45,250
to wrap up it's really your journey you

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,869
know I'm old you know Marco reviewed the

00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:49,660
slide this is tim you're old so this is

00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:52,630
really pointed out that what I learned

00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,520
is that you know I've been in this

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,849
business over 30 years and it's a long

00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,579
time and but it goes by really quickly

00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:04,359
when you enjoy it and the way you enjoy

00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:07,660
it is by bringing passion to your work

00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:09,430
and being part of a strong team and so

00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,579
open source is a great way to do that

00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,710
and so I hope you do it well it's hard

00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:18,400
it takes constant effort you're never

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:21,329
done but it's well worth the ride so do

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,329
it well thank

00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,920
scars we can escort the expressions

00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,090
