I

00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:00,149
do I have Mike and I speak with them is

00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:05,490
it Chuck Chuck Chuck Chuck good I can't

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,869
I can't hear myself at all or not we

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,819
have engineering things that need to go

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,580
the other direction josh is allegedly

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,340
the conduit for that that's right hi

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,319
there everybody my name is Remy to cause

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,860
maker and I'm the Fedora community

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,319
action and impact lead so mostly what I

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,410
do in Council land is the stuff that is

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,579
not engineering generally speaking so

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,560
ambassadors budget budget budget

00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:34,349
ambassadors education as well i'm also

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,629
the fedora council's education objective

00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,510
leads so figuring out how to do more

00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:41,480
stuff on universities and campuses

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,970
around the world not just in the US and

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,690
i serve on the Red Hat Oh SAS team so I

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,349
help to liaison Red Hat upstream fedora

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,889
community so when things are broken or

00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:58,260
not happy or whatever these guys are all

00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,180
doing the good work and the productive

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,940
things and i'm here to help take

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:09,299
community input and provide it back up

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:11,940
to Red Hat land so come talk to me so

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:14,519
welcome everybody my name is Ian kuzyk

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,510
and I'm program manager for fedora so

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:23,130
I'm responsible for scheduling I also

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:26,549
have the role of change wrangler and i'm

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,160
also running election so i guess that's

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:33,540
like this free main RS i'm responsible

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,299
for so if you have any anything please

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,519
send me an email because if you ask me

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,980
here i will probably forgot it once i

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,840
leave this room so you can ask whatever

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,690
we want but if you want something just

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,190
send me an email and i will probably or

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,190
hopefully i will not forgot it

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,540
I'm Dennis coma and one of the release

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,579
engineers and don't send me email

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,799
because I get too much so if you want to

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:11,690
get a hold of me ping me on IRC it's

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,370
much much better and I you know my job

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,769
is to try and make sure that we get the

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:22,610
bits out the door and can do it better

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:24,350
and faster and more my name is Adam

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,260
Miller I work on the floor engineering

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:32,180
team I also recently joined fesco I'm

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:35,570
also kind of I do what Dennis needs done

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,070
doesn't feel like doing to the best of

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,270
my ability I try to float around also I

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,840
do docker atomic things in fedora space

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,979
well I work on them I don't do them I

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,720
will not even remotely attempt take down

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:52,000
that much credit I also participate in

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,560
the foot our cloud cig I'm langdon white

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,320
originally I was on the council with no

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,220
responsibilities and then I which I

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,639
enjoyed but then I foolishly got led

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,039
into taking over fedora modular ization

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:20,360
so my role is tricking people into doing

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:22,699
that right the things to say first of

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,610
all first of all atoms snuck in here

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:28,340
he's the community monkey i think is for

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,530
a QA am I in this no I just think yeah

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,940
we're like we're pulling like you're

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,990
right so you can stay sitting if you

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:39,889
want or you can come up on the stage

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:42,979
okay I'm not oh man okay gee thanks okay

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:45,080
I'll go and stand in the corner I'm Adam

00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,539
Williamson I'm the fedora QA community

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,690
monkey officially I'm like the QA guy I

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,690
guess people call me the keyway guy

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,310
thanks you're welcome also we have on

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,310
the Fedora Council but not here we have

00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,740
listed up here of Christoph wichert who

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,719
is been appointed by fams go to sort of

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,770
represent that ambassadors and community

00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:07,169
side of things then roby duck who is one

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,569
of our

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,759
elected representatives as well and he

00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,319
is also from the websites team as a lead

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,529
of the websites team and he is generally

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,050
awesome and then Maria who we lock with

00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:20,789
us no estetica is going to be our new

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,279
diversity advisor and that's just

00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,689
starting up as well oh ok so that's

00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:31,080
that's the introductions now it's the

00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:34,279
questions time hey Brendan do you have a

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,349
question but where's the mic runner your

00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:41,069
yeah yeah sorry I almost appointed you

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:44,159
but look you got one yeah right ok ok

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,659
does it work it does work ok first thank

00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,849
you for like living and breathing fedora

00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:56,310
it's what I use every day and it makes

00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:57,689
me happy so two questions so RCM

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,810
question I'm about secondary

00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:02,029
architectures first I've heard two

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,849
slightly different stories about

00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:10,349
secondary arch in moving to the new Koji

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:12,689
will build failures initially block the

00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:14,639
success of an overall build or is the

00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:34,469
notion still that secondary arches if

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:37,439
they fail the build succeeds so if we

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:41,629
get to a world where we are building all

00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:44,550
of the rpms so in the RPM case building

00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:47,580
you know it has to succeed across all

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,729
the architectures and if it fails on one

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,039
it will fail the RPM build in the case

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:56,189
of composing the distribution and

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,319
putting together fedora if for some

00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:01,229
reason that you know the cloud images

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,979
fail or you know building of anaconda

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,120
fails because building the install

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,469
environment and you know we don't get

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,210
install media if that fails on the

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,819
secondary architecture that will not

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,770
fail the compose because it is a

00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,649
non-blocking deliverable and it will not

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,319
block stuff going out but in the RPM

00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,320
build sense it will we're looking at

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:27,070
putting in ways

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:31,420
to make sure now what we're looking at

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:33,430
put it in ways so that if you know if it

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,900
fails particularly leaf node stuff if

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,240
you just add an excluded if you had an

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,349
exclude arch the second the secondary

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,450
arch teams will get an automatic

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,970
notification that someone's committed

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,950
something that has excluded an arch and

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,400
you can do that and move on the core

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,230
stuff generally just works and it's we

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,660
don't perceive that there's much risk of

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:59,970
holding up anything in the distribution

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:59,970
because of that unless horrible cavity

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:18,220
so so hang on hang on hang on slow down

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:20,080
so don't hang up wait arm yes arm is

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,580
definitely the slowest but we got some

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:34,780
new build hardware right and so they

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:36,730
should speed up I'll repeat the comment

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,740
well is running the comment was that

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,390
it'll be want to be really slower much

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,720
slower to build everything if we block

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:47,470
on all the art so we have new I at 64

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,900
build hardware there's 30 nodes the

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,430
testing I've done on wed and running an

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:58,870
arm v7 vm on it it takes say for example

00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:03,790
a good two hours off the current arm v7

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:06,580
colonel build and in some cases possibly

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:12,160
even faster than the current x86 64

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:14,980
hardware in the case of say the power so

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,150
power 64 big-endian little-endian the

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,450
hardware is actually significantly

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:23,230
faster than x86 64 hardware that we

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:28,780
currently have so in the vast majority

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:31,990
of cases moving forward the hardware

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:34,150
will be at least as fast as the x86 64

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,880
stuff so you shouldn't see any

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:40,150
speed regressions and as soon as i get

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,260
network to the hardware and we can start

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:46,960
to put it in to production the bills

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,090
will go up significantly faster so the

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,430
arm v7 hardware we have at the moment is

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:54,940
about one point three gigahertz four gig

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,670
of ram the VMS that we're running are

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,070
like eight cores 12 gig of ram or

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:03,100
something like that with SSDs and

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,860
various other bits and pieces so they

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,780
are fast and a lot faster than the

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,780
current generation of arm v7 hardware

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:24,660
age we're just going to be awkward and

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,920
do this a lot also I alter around ok

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:33,130
switching switching from make it author

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:36,550
hardware to security so we have fedora

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,820
packagers get the certificates generated

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,970
every half a year currently they had

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:48,310
generated on the server what is the plan

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:50,950
to basically switch the being generated

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,080
at the client site where actually the

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:59,350
private key should be not at the server

00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:02,230
I don't think there is any such plan at

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,390
the time to do this but if you want to

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:09,550
help contribute to doing that that

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:11,830
sounds all right the question the

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,710
question dennis was right now when we

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,570
read we regenerate our certs every six

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,310
months he asked when we're going to

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,000
start generating the certificates on the

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:25,570
client so the private keys there so we

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,600
do with the CIA certificate that is used

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,030
to create the user certificates when I

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,410
created it I'm like oh ten years will

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,270
give us plenty time so it actually

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,220
expires in two years we have to do

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,620
something either renew the CA or

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,570
something else what I'd really really

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:44,650
like to do but need to have the cycles

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:48,290
to do it is input dog tag in

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:50,480
infrastructure and then have the user

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,310
would create the key on the private key

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,640
on their machine and we could then use

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:58,670
certain longer to automatically renew

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,340
the certificate and we could set this

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,200
the certificates to expire like every

00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,970
two weeks or four weeks they'll get

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,670
automatically renewed in the background

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,520
and that way if somebody you know steps

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,500
away there's it reduces the risk that

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,460
you know someone could use they get a

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:19,250
hold of that key and you know use the

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,070
machine to you know build things and so

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,630
you know from it from a general

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,480
perspective I think would be better a

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,460
role but you know we need to have time

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,670
and resources and what not to do that

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,500
and we have two years far away what's

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,960
the plan to make that susceptible for

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,360
other people to help do it I heard

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,580
somebody with mentioned Kerberos in the

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,050
audience sorry was that you volunteering

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:56,390
to do it because wouldn't that be

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:59,360
awesome okay yeah okay okay well perhaps

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,690
ya need to talk because I've never heard

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,310
of volunteers right so that is up any

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:09,200
rate yeah yep and I think we've we've

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,760
had historically some communication

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,680
problems about how to get those kind of

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,630
things into stuff that's happening and

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,290
in the last year so if you went to

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:20,420
tennis's talk which I skipped we've got

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,970
a much better now right we've got a much

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,320
better process for making sure that

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,340
those things don't get dropped on the

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,340
floor when they come in so

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,680
yeah I mean there has been some talking

00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:44,950
moving fast to be based on free IPA and

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,990
to enable her voice as well as ssl

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,110
certificate authentication for Koji and

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,140
different pieces of infrastructure but

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,600
it takes people you know doing the work

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,760
and you know we're getting better at

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,790
enabling people to do stuff but we're

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,430
still not perfect in the case of fast

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,100
like we have a we have the fast is

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,050
basically been rewritten recently so I

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,280
mean that's that was a discussion that

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,660
went on for a while I don't want to

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,250
rehash the whole thing here but I think

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,230
eventually it's one of those things that

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,410
you know maybe we want to move away from

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,700
from NIH in it and and doing something

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,830
different and I don't know what that

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,720
thing might be hopefully you know

00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,860
something like IPO would work you know

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,990
maybe there are other things out there I

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,760
don't know the answer to it because I'm

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:32,050
not the technical dude who would sus but

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,680
I'm certainly interested in finding

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:37,330
things that would reduce cases where the

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,190
federal engineering team ends up being

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,020
like their own upstream because that

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,970
just means more work for a small number

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,280
of people and as awesome as they are

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,150
there they don't have an infinite amount

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,150
of time so

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:09,399
yeah now agreed to might make that up

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,230
the quest or the comment is we want to

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,120
avoid grinding custom software and they

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,709
want us to avoid writing custom software

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,100
and it would be awesome if we all work

00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:31,149
together and we'll be done in two years

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:32,860
problem solved let's go home and next

00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,529
someone down here then someone up there

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,300
by the way algar this guy down here that

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,430
snuck in late he's Paul frailties the

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,690
fedora engineering manager he's also my

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,600
boss which is another reason why I'm

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:48,940
standing up here so in case you didn't

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,290
know former fpl yay Paul and I just came

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,389
in late and didn't want to be awkward

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,940
and sit down so he would like okay

00:16:52,389 --> 00:17:00,160
Paul's also on the federal workstation

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,630
working group hi guys so I actually

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,790
wanted to ask a question to make this

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:09,039
poor guy run up the stairs I'm just

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:10,750
kidding I have two questions so there's

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,179
nine of you on stage are you the nine

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:19,809
power users that might Matt referred to

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:25,480
this morning yep dennis is one of them

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:27,280
and Adam is one of them I ok so now do

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,409
you know who they are Matt yes I'm not

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,470
gonna name all the names ok I was just

00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:34,929
curious my-my question actually is and I

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,580
know you guys like to dump drive right

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,980
into the technical details and have

00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,539
these technical conversations but I

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,370
would really love to know how somebody

00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,140
who has no coding skills whatsoever can

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,570
get involved in fedora and it would be

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,840
really great if you could talk more

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,840
about that

00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:01,250
we do have it so that's a great question

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,530
and there are a couple different places

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,300
where people can involved so there's a

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,740
new team within fedora that we've

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,140
started this year called community

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,850
operations which is sort of a generalist

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,500
group of people that are ninjas that are

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,900
supposed to go between the different sub

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,490
projects and within that team there's an

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,740
onboarding process so that you can get

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,140
acquainted with each part of fedora so

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,820
we have an onboarding series of badges

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,500
which are part of Fedora badges so that

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,870
there's easy on ramps to sort of get

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,900
introduced the project and do tasks like

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,090
write blog posts interview team members

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,100
help with the release schedule tasks

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,960
that sort of don't fall into one

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,940
particular place like helping yarn with

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,920
elections and helping to craft the

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,750
release announcements and a lot of non

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,900
technical but very vital community

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,690
infrastructure once folks can start on

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,900
ramping there and with also Fedora join

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,300
and what can I do for fedora org which

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,560
are great sort of sorting hats to help

00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,330
people figure out where they want to get

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,560
in then they can get introduced to

00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,210
different parts of the project and

00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,790
figure out who the upstream mentors are

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,340
within fedora and then get plugged into

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,990
those teams so we're working on that a

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,450
lot and with the diversity and inclusion

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,040
advisor tactica I think we're going to

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,540
do a much better job of engaging with

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,910
other international communities as well

00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,100
and other underrepresented communities

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,870
you know there's a lot of it's not just

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,940
about culture it's about a typical

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,620
contributors so having non technical

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,140
ways to contribute to the project is

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,670
huge and outreach II is a program that

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,680
helps us with that as well where we can

00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,390
get interns who are not necessarily

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,550
technical to work on this kind of stuff

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,680
so this is a conversation I'm very

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,210
excited about I would love to talk more

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,740
about it and there are lots of other

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,510
places too to help and I saw other

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:48,140
people who wanted to answer so I'm going

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:50,150
to pass the mic so I just want to say QA

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,330
we obviously have a lot of stuff for

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,160
non-technical people to do we have

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,290
entries in what can I do for fedora and

00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,210
we have a wiki joining page which is not

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,950
the best thing ever we would love help

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,429
with cleaning it up but it is there and

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,049
it gives you a list of very

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:12,659
things you can do that are not technical

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:14,309
and helps you do them who's next or

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:17,999
dumbest guy in the stage gets the mic

00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:20,519
that's awesome um so yeah so my entry

00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:21,899
into fedora was non-technical and you

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,149
could argue i'm a little more technical

00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:26,429
now like actually wrote some code and

00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:28,230
last few years but it's terrible so i

00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:32,700
think that counts in my favor is being

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:34,980
the one technical I do Oh will be yeah

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,720
but I trained for that after i came to

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,889
Red Hat like it was a like I was almost

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,110
forced to so anyway but um there's you

00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:45,570
know documentation group is out there

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,639
that's how I got started writing docs I

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,409
have very very strong strong love for

00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:52,049
docs under Stevens grinning up and

00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:56,249
Stephen gilson's content strategist a

00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:57,570
redhead and he is awesome and and one of

00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:59,519
the things that I feel very passionately

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,919
about is making sure that people can

00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,509
contribute in places like that without

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,509
having to learn a whole bunch of tools

00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,879
and and right now the docs group is kind

00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:10,769
of re-energizing and sort of thinking

00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:13,230
about how that works I do not want to

00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,789
speak for the docs leadership which

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,249
includes Pete Travis I don't think he's

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,350
here he's an awesome dude and I think he

00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,299
also feels that the tools and things

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,919
they're using or have become way out of

00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,320
step with what the rest of the world

00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,629
prefers to use and there are so much

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,480
better things available nowadays so for

00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:33,090
example having somebody who does has no

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,179
affiliation with fedora I'm able to

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,490
actually drop in edit a document live

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:41,519
and have that change actually come to

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,889
the docs team as what you know what we

00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,779
call you know pull request in the coding

00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:47,610
world right and somebody in the back end

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,159
is going to see that and look at it and

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,389
take it in or not right and when you

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,440
know when people get a little taste of

00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:54,539
being able to do that and they get a

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,340
thank-you back or you know if they sign

00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,769
in to fedora later they get a badge all

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,190
those things can be used to sort of keep

00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:04,379
the project sticky but it's all about

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,360
making possibilities for people to do

00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:09,360
things in the long tail because as

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,700
Matthew showed you know we we we

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,799
actually have you know tent-like like

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,149
said I think ten percent of the ten

00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,260
percent was a ten percent of the

00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:18,330
population was doing

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,180
a third word I can't get I keep I keep

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,920
forgetting what it was ten ten percent

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,170
are doing two thirds of the word that's

00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,820
that's not terrible but it's not great

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,140
but the good thing about it is is that

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,700
it means there's a very long tail of

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,320
ninety percent that are doing the other

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,290
third of the work and that is a lot of

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,240
work so if we can make more ways for

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,890
that tail to get bigger and like more of

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,810
the mass to be in the tail like the

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,220
brontosaurus to have a bigger tale that

00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,930
will be awesome although I know we don't

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,240
like brontosauruses but they make really

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,570
good know their visual for their okay

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,300
again the brontoburgers ok so the only

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,850
thing I would also add great it right

00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,170
now this minute the best way you could

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,320
help to contribute in a non technical

00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,690
way to is to actually work with Remy

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:06,030
working on the how do you contribute in

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:10,410
non-technical ways exactly oh and design

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:20,330
yes designs a big part mo can't do all

00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:24,780
of the design yes basically well hello

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:27,660
hello I'd like to add something from my

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,730
from me in fact I unfortunately we have

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,100
issues not only with non-technical

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,320
people but also with technical people

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,350
who want to join fedora for example who

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,290
want to work on an infrastructure like

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:44,280
I'd like to remind you what's going for

00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,960
just to vent here when a guy who knows a

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,690
little about cameras wants to

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,290
participate and all on all he got in

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,360
return is just 0 you can come and do

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:58,500
something unfortunately doesn't work

00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:01,320
like this in the open source world maybe

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,470
I already told you about a year ago and

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,380
probably previous year it's almost

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,230
impossible most impossible to contribute

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,770
to fedora infrastructure because in

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,440
order to contribute one could try to

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,150
implement a part of infrastructure to

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,800
want to contribute and this is

00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,280
impossible because we don't have a

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:26,460
configuration we don't have a schematic

00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,620
scour you can build that's why we don't

00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,690
see a lot of people start

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,330
contributing on fedora infrastructure

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:39,780
what's compared to for example other

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:42,890
areas yeah that's that's cool but I

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:46,110
ain't finished yet what we need is the

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:48,000
the things it is a plan how to

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,030
contribute actually you have to download

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,770
these and this is it let's say Koji we

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:56,130
have to know about that and that that's

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:58,860
about body our body and if you want to

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,990
improve it this is our repository and

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,940
this is how you can you download how can

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:05,010
start up in this configuration of

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,929
virtual environments we don't have it

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:20,520
yet so before we start to well the you

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:23,400
know ya gotta all right so last Tuesday

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,920
I guess it was a config management camp

00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,410
which was in ghent in Belgium we gave a

00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,210
talk on open infrastructure in fedora so

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,910
it may not be as widely known but we

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,740
have a wide open infrastructure the

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,740
fedora infrastructure apprentices

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,170
program all you have to do basically is

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,330
sign up for mailing list introduce

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,640
yourself respond to an email once a

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,200
month and join the weekly meetings we

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,880
recently migrated in the last two years

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,800
all of our ansible playbooks are

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,900
absolutely public so every part of our

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,090
infrastructure is public and open and if

00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,580
you join them wait if you join the

00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,800
meetings we talk about all of the things

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,000
on the agenda and the Fedora

00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,010
infrastructure team is actually one of

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,510
the most open parts I mean so that's

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,910
like if you want to get involved in

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:08,010
fedora infra specifically there's a

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,950
slide deck it talks about we just

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,720
presented on this again and I agree like

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,429
we can absolutely do better with this

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,490
stuff always and we need to do a good

00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:16,490
job

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,640
I'm gonna put a figure as well so he has

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,429
huge chunk of infrastructure in a forge

00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,230
that is like github that I've small

00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:31,790
request it's it's a punji that project

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:57,380
is as much technical debt as any other

00:26:31,790 --> 00:27:00,700
ten-year-old organization so so okay we

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,110
do those profitable game will try to bed

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,510
it's not it's not just promise to you

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,700
better we've got dry so we've got

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,500
developers of Nora project org which is

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,140
not infrastructure specific but it is

00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,990
stuff for fedora developers we're

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,760
working on hubs which is not specific to

00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,710
your question but it will show you

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,290
exactly what's going on in the Fedora

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,419
project kind of in a live state right so

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,850
I agree we have these problems where

00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,650
people that want to contribute to fedora

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,570
or fedora infrastructure specifically

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:33,049
don't even know where to start right

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:38,240
that's kind of the problem but so we're

00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:42,799
actually this is like the one time i get

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,630
my boss to be like what's better so i

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,190
think that over the years we have

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,890
realized that this is hard to do and

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,240
we're working on it and there are small

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,950
things that will eventually bring them

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,360
together and now i'm going to let Paul

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:58,429
talk just cuz he pays me I do not um so

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,290
one thing the the one thing that we like

00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:02,360
to say is we actually there are a whole

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,590
list of tasks that are called issues in

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,530
the Fedora infrastructure right we've

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,510
got a track that's full of them and

00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,520
those are things that people can work on

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,250
so if you are showing up not knowing

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,809
what you can work on that would be a way

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,190
to target where you were working on and

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:17,450
then you can work with one of the people

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,669
in the infrastructure team to say

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,010
specifically here's the thing i feel

00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:24,020
like i can do what do i need to do in

00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:26,030
order to be able to fix that thing but i

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,040
will also tell you there is a barrier to

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,720
get over and it's called trust right

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,580
when you show up we're not just going to

00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,200
let you you know traipse around our

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:37,980
infrastructure

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,540
yeah you're what you're saying is you

00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,430
would like an environment that you could

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,640
replicate parts of our infrastructure

00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:46,710
and do that kind of thing right yep so

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,940
yeah yeah that's what so you're rim is

00:28:46,710 --> 00:29:07,470
getting to the exact thing doesn't say

00:28:47,940 --> 00:29:09,870
so are we havin ants that's right way

00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,060
they they they don't even hand me the

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,590
like like I supposedly I'm these guys

00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,780
boss and they don't let me on these

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,820
systems really easy to join the Fedora

00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,890
infrastructure apprentices and get basic

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,340
access to things it is I did it hold it

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:26,280
yeah yeah we beat by but i will say

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:29,190
anyway Remy gets the last word so the

00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,770
last thing is that we do give read-only

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,450
access to all of the infrastructure when

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,950
you join the apprentices group so even

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,750
if you don't have write access we are

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,490
absolutely trusting you when you join

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,100
the infrastructure team to see exactly

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,870
how everything works there's we're

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,850
trying our best to lower the barrier to

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,550
entry for trust and this is something we

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,660
need to talk now task identification is

00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:51,060
something we can do better with

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,310
absolutely we have easy fix bugs but

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,840
that is everywhere so we can talk more

00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,580
about this we got to go another question

00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,160
I have to say one more thing then we

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,170
really are going really early and the

00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,370
last thing was that I I definitely hear

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,530
what you're saying about being able to

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,420
replicate infrastructure and I think

00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,710
that is a worthy goal so I am going to

00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,730
take that under advisement and see if

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,350
that's something that we might be able

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,690
to pursue somehow because I like the

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,270
idea of being able to like shoot down

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,160
like a at least a microcosm of what we

00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,230
do so that you can actually practice at

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,300
home or try something and see how it

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:26,930
works I think it's a great idea really

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,930
done really done

00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,800
hi you bundle like 12 years ago made

00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,620
Linux really simple so codex drivers you

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,990
can simply install them there I know why

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:43,440
it's hot in fedora but will we finally

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:45,750
catch up there like sooner or later on

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,420
and when how my tears would you like to

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,070
take this question you would like me to

00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,220
take ya Paul which I can take this

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,830
question and at the moment we're working

00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,560
on in getting the final steps put in

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:02,670
place so that we can have a fedora built

00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,860
and Cisco shipped open h.264 codec and

00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:07,980
there's lots of hardware now that is

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,170
implementing in the hardware like media

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,000
engines to decode all the Codex and as

00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,580
long as all that everything that's

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,800
pattern it is in the hardware there's no

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,290
reason we can't have the glue in fedora

00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,810
that can you know street you know d MUX

00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,970
video and audio and send of the video to

00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:27,690
you know the hardware to do the

00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,520
rendering and I think it it's going to

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,590
be a less of a problem over time but but

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,990
patents are continuing to be a problem

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:36,870
this is a government issue that we

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:38,640
cannot fix we are bound by the law so if

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:44,880
the long as the law is hostile to us so

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:54,720
it sucks that's that has nothing to do

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:56,670
with codex though right it doesn't it

00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:05,310
simply works because they don't rev

00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:13,680
there colonel yes but quickly because

00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:16,680
this is a big and it was really hard and

00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,670
it was way more disastrous than you

00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,080
think it was so just take my advice

00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:25,070
we're really not in this battle position

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,070
as you think we might be

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,120
where the projects originated and where

00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:35,409
they're bound to by law like we are we

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,860
have to comply with different sets of

00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:41,830
patents and things in export law

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:46,630
compared to something that's founded in

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:48,909
South Africa I know I know but like I

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,289
feel like it's a circular question like

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:57,039
it there's certain problems we can't

00:32:50,289 --> 00:33:00,700
solve because we're legally bound yes he

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,990
asked about the nvidia driver so to

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:07,080
answer your question will we ever

00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:10,270
include the nvidia driver no but but but

00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,750
i believe there is work that is either

00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:15,460
planned or already done where if a user

00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,950
were to go out and get the nvidia driver

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,710
for example and install it on their

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:25,000
system and somehow magically make it

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:28,090
work we will try not to break their

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,470
system for them okay so the problem with

00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,820
the nvidia driver aside from it being

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,710
proprietary and closed source and

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,990
everybody knows this is that you install

00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,090
it you finally get it working you run

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,649
dnf update and you get a new kernel and

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,080
you reboot and now you don't see

00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:44,919
anything on your screen or you know

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:48,279
other bad things happen so i believe

00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,690
there was some work planned i'm looking

00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,220
at matey's because he knows of this as

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,720
well i'm not sure it's done but there is

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:58,360
work plan yeah so so that if you do that

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:02,649
and it gets working and you update your

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,779
kernel it'll try really hard to not set

00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:07,120
the default kernel to the new one and

00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:08,530
then you'll have to like manually go in

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,389
and say oh there's a new kernel I need

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,830
to select that and figure it out now

00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,869
it's not going to fix it if it is broken

00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,179
but at least it'll save you the trouble

00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:17,470
of like having to reboot seven times

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,490
trying to figure out why your new kernel

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,470
doesn't work when really it's your

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,379
nvidia driver so we're not going to

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,240
include it but we're going to make it

00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:28,810
slightly more user friendly so because i

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,540
mean there are people who need faster

00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:33,429
drivers and that's cool i'm not going to

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,740
weigh in on the the morality of the

00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,659
issue but we can't do things to make it

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,450
better for users who are stuck in that

00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:44,339
situation I have another

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:51,010
question you're getting a workout today

00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:55,089
please yes well I didn't check but can

00:34:51,010 --> 00:35:05,800
you just include the DKMS it will so

00:34:55,089 --> 00:35:07,359
wipe don't lip gel but alternative

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,070
system is I mean just copy that what

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:22,980
Debbie indeed the alternative system is

00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:29,859
still in fedora but it doesn't work well

00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:31,690
all right I would let you do that but

00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:37,720
you got to be quick cuz weird like going

00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:39,220
down a rabbit hole here all right yeah

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,320
this is a question that comes up every

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,680
time we have this panel but we had a

00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,119
slightly new answer yeah I mean it took

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:53,109
ten years but we're kind of starting to

00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:56,560
listen all right next question five

00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:58,950
minutes make it quick yeah there's one

00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,950
back there

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:10,819
alright so matt has the popularity of

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:14,450
fedora over time graph thing with a

00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:17,299
giant spike at the end of it um have we

00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,710
mapped that to anything because like if

00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:21,039
you look at distrowatch or anything

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:28,309
there's no massive spike in fedora in

00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:32,359
recent I'm saying can you prove in any

00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:40,809
way the the stats you have are relevant

00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:40,809
like yeah you just had it it was like

00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:45,109
believe that linux mint is the top of

00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,089
that craft because people are searching

00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:48,740
for other kinds of mint and you know

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:54,680
like further drinks and whatever and

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:56,809
there they go on the vet page so we have

00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,029
some correlating evidence I actually

00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:03,020
don't even have that slide in this deck

00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:05,720
anymore oh yeah so there's some other

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,770
other things that show with the

00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,510
correlating evidence that shows that

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,240
popular is going up for these releases

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:15,049
there's a new feature a network manager

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,369
which hits a file on our web server to

00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:18,049
help determine whether you're trapped

00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:20,480
behind a captive portal like at this

00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:22,010
university or not so that it can tell

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,779
you that you need to log in to their

00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,359
terrible page and all the terrible

00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:29,809
things of that entails and so that

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:32,480
feature was added in fedora 21 and the

00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:35,599
hits on that are going up at the same

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,920
rate that the adaptation on the update

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,329
server of 21 and on are going up pretty

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,210
pretty closely so there's correlation

00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,920
there so I am confident that the line is

00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,020
definitely going up I still no idea what

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,809
the axis means but I confident there in

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,690
the relative amount it's a happy graph

00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:55,130
also and also started or project org

00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,910
which is the page that people get by

00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:01,460
default as their initial install sorry

00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:04,430
so there's a start on fedora project org

00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,339
page that Mozilla Firefox features when

00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:08,900
you first install fedora um a lot of

00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:10,880
people we believe leave that on there

00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,040
leave that as a default I mean just

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,070
because they just never get around to

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,300
and it's not that big a deal anymore and

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,190
you know I don't Lang to raise his hand

00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,130
I do too i don't think i've ever touched

00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,390
it but but that number also is going up

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,770
and so that would also be a good

00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,780
indicator that there are more people

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,340
picking up so so that's like is that

00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,450
there's there's several correlating

00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,980
factors here like we didn't look at this

00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,970
and go great we got the numbers we want

00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,530
don't look any further well I did but

00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:38,420
but then you did so that was important

00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,330
all right do we have two minutes for one

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,490
more you got to get a better question

00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:51,590
better question a better it was a good

00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:54,800
question I sometimes browse the federal

00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:56,960
users list archives and I know Matt

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,570
answers a lot and so does some of the

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,690
members on this stage so any comment on

00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:06,440
the tone and how the users were

00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:09,230
happiness or unhappiness you observe I

00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,890
would observe that eel mailing list sir

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:15,710
for old people as I said before and yeah

00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:18,200
and in fact I think that for a while we

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:20,150
had a problem and i'm an old people in

00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,540
this context so i got to put that out

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,680
there uh we've had it had a problem on

00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,810
the mailing that's where the tone was

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,730
really negative for a while and that

00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,650
drove away all of the people who didn't

00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,600
want to deal with that so the default

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,700
tone on the mailing list is set at a

00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,210
grumpiness level that is higher than i

00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:41,300
would like it to be i hope that as we

00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:44,990
move to hyper kitty then we will have a

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:50,090
sort of a new influx of people and I

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:53,500
intend to be very aggressive aggressive

00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:56,720
I'm not an aggressive person aggressive

00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,640
if this enthusiastic about encouraging

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,090
people who take a negative tone on the

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,890
mailing list to not do so so that new

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:06,020
people feel more welcome on the list

00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:09,040
there including enforcing our code of

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,040
conduct well as well as

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,930
the other it would help if more people

00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,000
want to hyper Katie and use the hyper

00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,070
kitty features to vote things I was it

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,440
to other communication mechanisms as

00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:26,860
well it's those are out of times anybody

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,330
stopping us or just keep ya so they're

00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:32,130
at their there's still work to be done

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,130
here so we are getting there though oh

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,460
ok sorry thank you

00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:08,559
that one's super well Harry yeah hey

00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:08,559
