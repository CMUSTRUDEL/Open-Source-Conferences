Title: Python 3 Porting - Miro Hrončok, Rober Kuska, Mike McLean, Matej Stuchlik
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	In connection with a Python 3 Porting Fedora Activity day we would like to organize something similar as a DevConf Workshop. It is meant for people who want to port something to Python 3 (either a project of their own choosing or just want to help out in general) with the help of other like-minded folks.

Tool to keep track of P3 support status:

 happens ratchet or capital market

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:29,819
Thank You mr. Hankey I go to put on

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:34,439
occasion okay you're so stupid agree

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:37,349

user acquisition system

00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,830
ok

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,699
welcome welcome on the 55 m3 packaging

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,490
workshop one thing working working

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,990
working oh sorry by the three-part

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,370
direction hopefully you all have

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,190
prepared the Bible three applications

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:10,770
reporting and and guys can help you with

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:12,479
them so okay now everyone um Oh does

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,400
anyone mind if I will sit while I'll

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,990
talk okay thank you so for so I'm

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,930
Roberta Cusco this is my rock on track

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,389
and this is my typically we are vital

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:31,020
main team in red head and we do like

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:35,849
item song I guess that's what do you so

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:38,699
so welcome to our workshop which in fact

00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:44,279
isn't really a workshop because the

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:50,009
truth because this is a hackathon so my

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:52,409
idea is that there are there are groups

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:55,110
I expect to people like one group of

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,719
people is our federal packagers and

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,270
another group be like Python developers

00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:03,690
and maybe there are groups which are

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:07,560
both and also there will be like some

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:13,860
people who came here just stalk and so

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:18,930
we we created like jobs I took like desk

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:25,380
you can help us with exporting to python

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:28,919
3 so this is our main page its sporting

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:34,199
de vie for fedora it contains like a

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:37,610
list of packages just about yeah you can

00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,740
take a look how it looks

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,509
there is a lot of packages you can

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,349
choose like any package you would like

00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:47,810
to work on and there are like different

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:53,030
things you can do here here are example

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:56,360
because it's like two men or two to make

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:59,270
things that may happen is that one is

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,090
the package has already a Python 3

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,539
support but for some reason it is not in

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:08,599
fedora so when you are a fan or a

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:12,379
packager you can create a great back you

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,770
can create a page for spec file and you

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:19,550
can submit it to do the maintainer i

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:23,870
have i have slide about this yep here it

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:26,210
is so you can you can find back great

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,020
page and send it to the maintainer and

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,849
he may be will apply it and it will be

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,479
in federal so that's the first thing you

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:36,919
can do it's kind of menu process because

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:42,349
we don't have an information about

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:48,020
upstream supplemental Python 3 so you

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:50,300
have to check on it and because of that

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,690
there is another thing you can do and

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:59,659
you can help us make our porting to be

00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:01,520
better in that way that you can you can

00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,560
add functionality to port in the bit to

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,069
query upstream for Python through

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,589
readiness there is a github where you

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:12,520
can find the port in DB if you have any

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:16,310
questions there's ask us and we'll

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,219
provide you like more information and as

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:23,960
I was speaking about the federal

00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:26,060
packages there are bitin packaging

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,759
guidelines you should follow when you

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,479
when you when you are creating patches

00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:36,079
for packages and if you are in doubt ask

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,360
me or any of us or any of us but go

00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:41,900
ahead actually a question yes when we

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,720
come across a package that is just doing

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,700
in-dash food should we also convert it

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,010
to be due to be heightened to dash to

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,720
providing high finish food often using

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,690
the piping that price drops a week or

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,630
should we just leave it it would be nice

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,370
thing to do but it's not necessary

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,850
according to the guidelines to convert

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,890
all the packages by its very good idea

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,620
when you see a spec file that follows

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:10,310
all guidelines in a situation that I'm

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,010
dead so I actually reminds with this

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,730
it's really great but that but I've run

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:19,160
into some issues where it makes it much

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:26,990
more difficult to share spec files with

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:31,190
like packages oh because the macros for

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:33,650
providing the two and three aren't

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,160
aren't in the revo so you basically have

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:49,160
to have conjugal or you have get

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:51,860
branches I mean if you have branch in

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,330
packages with ethyl six on seven then

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,690
their spec file is kind of messy yeah

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:02,630
and then you have packages where there

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,430
are five things in the spec file and

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,770
stuff like that okay it's a real 7 i'm

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,360
happy i just at some point that i tried

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,880
it i reread the issues because it wasn't

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,100
there and I was like oh I don't have to

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:21,680
maintain its not in the Urals is it

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:26,480
ethical sir it's an apple and cool we

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,250
are happy if you are happy and if your

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,000
Python developer you would like to port

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,700
things to buy today then made you will

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,090
say to something about it I guess oh ok

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:40,160
so there's several tools and ways you

00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,730
can get help on how to work things

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:48,000
differently

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:51,120
best books that our brand cross is 40 to

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,329
50 feet actually it's available free

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,630
online on that page PDF and you can

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:59,339
order it as a physical book for like

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,920
five dollars or something interesting

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,889
good it's kind of old but yes still

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,120
netted twice and then there are a couple

00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:12,060
tools for helping you for from working

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,529
here 53 which will we will hope you use

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:21,560
today so the first one is 223 which

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:26,750
helps you transform Python 25 25.3

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:31,980
there's six which is it a utility that

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:34,949
provides several wrappers so that your

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,310
code can cover Kim function under Python

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:39,779
2 and five and three at the same time

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,850
there's modernized which is a bit like

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:47,670
two to three just more you know better

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:51,240
actually if I can actually do a patsy to

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,480
free takes part in to code and make it

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,790
do magic to make it by country club a

00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,149
modernized do magic to make it both can

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:02,610
drink and usually unfortunately that's

00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,470
what I've seen project wants one spare

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,870
well it would be very nice wait that's

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,819
reality yeah and it's unfortunately

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,699
thank you for the partners because it's

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:15,120
much easier to just pour to free than to

00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:20,670
actually try to portico that's reality

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:23,060
is unfortunate yes reality is that the

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:28,670
Python language students have to work

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:33,239
yes I others robberies rotten platforms

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,860
most of the wheel yeah I see all the

00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:38,519
reasons it's just unfortunate for us

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:45,269
that's it so you got okay and then we

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:47,339
have got the five pi 3c which is a see

00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,369
my Maker makers for single source

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,679
compatibility FC extension so you've got

00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:54,600
again again right 1c extension that's

00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,480
compatible with Python to entice them to

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,279
you okay that's about that i would like

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,649
to i would like to ask a few questions

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,259
could I have a show of hands how many

00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:07,920
people came here with a specific project

00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:10,769
in mind they liked for it doesn't yeah

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:28,160
you could you could you give me the name

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:28,160
it's my own actually it's okay good luck

00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:41,879
so start now there are few more people

00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:44,509
ugly yeah all right and what's that

00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,509
another person

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:59,240
oh ok ok and so what which people would

00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,069
like us to give them an Isetta of a

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,749
small project they can work on is there

00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:06,949
someone like that with someone like to

00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:10,459
work on a project by the 42,000 three no

00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:14,389
ok so what hello I hope I see is you

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:16,999
actually taken some project and guide in

00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:21,850
so that everybody can see what the

00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:21,850
changes you feel really like life coach

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:42,589
coachy animation actually so actually

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,290
I'm actually not playing around with six

00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:50,300
yeah what kind of utilities doesn't have

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:54,139
and does it have utilities for dealing

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:57,290
with the white versus strength because

00:14:54,139 --> 00:15:01,160
that's my biggest pain point it's not

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:04,730
like six is not a tool it's it's library

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,610
ilysm it is supposed to work like when

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,579
you use a lot of ifdef code like if this

00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:14,509
is version blah blah blood and this and

00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:18,379
it's so six colors those use cases for

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:21,529
example our imports for libraries which

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:24,740
will changed in Python 3 so instead of

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:27,050
you writing try import blah blah except

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,660
import blah blah you only write from six

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,160
import this it's not like any magic

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:36,620
there is like like real compatibility oh

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,589
so then let me rephrase my question do I

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,170
get help managing the byte array versus

00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:44,899
strain this problem yep because this

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,430
video is to two parties I read mostly

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:50,020
next

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:52,899
work stuff that's a lot Ellis do things

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:56,380
in this six could help you in little

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:58,660
things like is this a string that's a

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,360
complicated question if you want to have

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,370
a do and free compatible so there is

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,640
something in six I believe it's six dots

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,490
drink types yes and you can just ask as

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,450
this type in shrinks six string types

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:18,070
and it gets the dakotas cleaner but the

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:20,770
actual decoding and encoding that was

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,690
done automagically in legacy Python and

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:26,440
now in Python free you have to do

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,180
programa CLE right and that's up to you

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,240
to do it and six cannot help you with

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,190
that and if you do it these encode and

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,560
decode think you probably don't break

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:38,020
Python to compatibility because in

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,170
Python to you can write shrink dot and

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:45,779
coach Doug encode dot encode not encode

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,779
and it results in strings me everything

00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:05,230
I don't think that shoots yes yeah it's

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:08,199
the thing here is in the Python free the

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:13,540
idea is this is not possible to to

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:16,179
automatically biggest I the biggest

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,880
problem here is not the Python itself

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:21,400
yeah it's that application has to have

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,240
notion of separation yes Weiner it

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,670
probably remain data types which doesn't

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,550
it just as like and having them handle

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,530
that adds a lot of code that hurts

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,080
readability

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,080
and I'm inside any code at her Xperia T

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,920
you can if you use this is something

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,480
that's fighting free only so probably

00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,350
not very useful if you want to maintain

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,830
compatibility but you can use type

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:53,370
annotations in your functions and then

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,080
run a static analyzer if something

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,790
that's supposed to take bites isn't

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:02,880
sending actually string and stuff like

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:08,880
that now I believe today that's cool the

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,170
annotation thing you did like because

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,450
I'm going to be well enough people are

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,570
making these orbs having things to

00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:19,380
consider for example a held up for them

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:24,390
it's where the same input to the same

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:27,480
functions can be a binary or air or a

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:31,520
stream your hands in on actual attribute

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:37,770
I in the elder which is not very visible

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:39,270
in the application of your right I'm not

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,530
complaining about free by the way and

00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,420
actually complaining about having to

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:48,550
maintain

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:50,290
don't come to the team slides maybe do

00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,820
we have more slides where this was

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,940
everything like there was everything

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,680
inside ok so now that now is there is

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:02,020
the process when everyone will choose

00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,730
his package and we'll call it yeah we

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,080
can how many of you are actually

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:13,600
interested more in the RPM packaging of

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:22,990
this in fedora yes that's what is clear

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:25,240
right guys do a workshop and then there

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,350
is most of you actually in a parting of

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:33,280
patent code right so if you look at the

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,650
porting DB there are red packages those

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,210
are blocked by a dependency and you

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,230
probably shouldn't for the package that

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,680
has unported dependency so then they are

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:47,350
light great packages char packages that

00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:51,010
are not you can they don't have Python

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:55,000
free support in fedora and but all this

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:57,550
if any are already ported so if you

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,780
don't have any package in mind you can

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:05,860
just browse it this list and choose it's

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:08,800
actually much easier to port I don't

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,870
know don't choose a graphic application

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,270
tool for doing something and stuff like

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,900
that just something little you should

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:20,980
probably choose something you know there

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:31,300
is a graph it takes ages to load I guess

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:34,390
and yeah the last day to show that the

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:39,420
protective Asia voice for girls which is

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,420
mark already can you show what

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,899
yeah we can realize that come is that is

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,909
there a way to search by users on the on

00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:50,129
a like Beckett roller says I think I saw

00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,309
as your Christian by one of my packages

00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:56,879
so I would like to know is my package

00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:59,399
it's not there but if you want us you

00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:04,799
can also work on this like editor and

00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:10,190
functional to the park in a way so what

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:16,620
what do you want you to see core details

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:19,769
mr. Orange if it's orange it means that

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:23,129
it it is in some kind of progress like

00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:25,970
somebody created back for it somebody is

00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:29,250
working on patches or whatever because I

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:32,820
we used to have her before several of

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:35,549
poor things to python 3 and there were

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,370
people who started poured some things so

00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:40,370
they were marked marked like in progress

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:58,230
some kind of when you click on the

00:21:50,610 --> 00:22:04,169
package okay yes so so I choose the free

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:07,940
path when you click the control of

00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,940
trauma so what is the veritas

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,600
all of the most of the information in

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:26,560
there is like gathered from from repos

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:29,740
and it's very hard to gather reasons for

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,990
think there are also text files young

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,240
files to describe you can put

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,600
descriptions in them saying something

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,480
like this and this and this person is

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,880
working on it and you can add urls to

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,070
repositories where the porting is

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,270
happening do you back to us and stuff

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,840
like that but this has to be done

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:52,030
manually so sometimes we don't nothing

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:56,440
you can see the dependencies of of these

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:59,350
things and this actually says that the

00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,990
back is closed but the thing is still

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,030
not marked as done which means either

00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:07,810
there is something that should depend

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:10,200
only on to buy it depends on two and

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,640
three as you can see policy curators

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:17,470
graphical user interface finger depends

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:28,090
on free and to which is weird why would

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:40,840
you need yeah there is a dependent

00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:43,510
signal yeah so so that's probably why it

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,780
marks in progress because it's checks if

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,730
every error if every package or sub

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:51,490
package only depends on free that is

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,890
fine go ahead move along or if it has

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,440
Python to you and Python free sub

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:59,350
packages where Python t sub packages the

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,260
penalty in free depend on free and such

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:06,010
if there is a reason for a package to

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,130
depend on both etc you can do pull

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:12,250
request on github on porting db2 the yab

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:16,560
files and market has done and put their

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,560
in a sentence describing why

00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:34,499
that will be great even better yes so

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:38,279
one thing about porting BB it's not the

00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:40,649
real time it's generated once in a while

00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:45,330
and if you are on back on the main page

00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:50,369
then in a top right corner there is a

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:59,999
date and time stamp where where where it

00:24:50,369 --> 00:25:02,669
was iterated Daris actually maybe a

00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:05,690
feature I know if it's terriot when you

00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:09,749
can see how how many lines of Python or

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:12,749
C code is used in a package so when you

00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:19,259
click a package try whatever choose a

00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:22,289
package here yeah and in the down left I

00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:26,730
guess below the dependencies you can see

00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:33,539
there are a lot of lines of code so you

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:39,139
move along and choose another face also

00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:39,139
we can show you our graph of the history

00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:47,399
going packages are packages already on

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:50,249
Python 3 the caster there is the 10 line

00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:55,080
of orange which are packages in progress

00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:57,240
and the gray packages are packages which

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,869
are ready to report it like all the

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,990
dependencies are already solved and red

00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:07,470
red one are the packages which shall

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:12,600
still blocked all dependencies as you

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:14,880
can see we are slowly climbing up we

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,450
also find it up

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,030
but not so much there is a little blue

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,210
thing it means a packaging error yes

00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:28,990
it's probably like there was a Python

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:31,570
3.5 rebuilt in fedora and some packages

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:37,260
and build it because they have some

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:42,370
problem with compatibility so if i have

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:45,670
the same basic wispies nothing all it

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:47,470
depends on certainly means package it on

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:51,100
the whole fight with a little but the

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,080
cold of the screen and sound asleep item

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,870
so that i can i can then Brown

00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:01,200
modernizing leads right to get something

00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:04,840
that works yes it should not always

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:09,790
smooth yes exactly I'm girls with Nicole

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,970
into something that's how it works like

00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:15,370
we firstly the first thing you want to

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,860
board is test if you have any if you

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:27,940
don't that's like really bad kind of

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:31,750
situation but like in samba case yes we

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:35,410
have automated sequel which also also

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:40,540
generates see python bindings to that

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:44,350
seat bolt which then is used by the type

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:48,250
of new modules written in Python those

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:50,860
can be converted to those can be modeled

00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:54,330
as a transit this way the Stillwell's

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:57,630
work with five and three until the whole

00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:03,149
modules that are also generated from 0

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:07,679
to generate C chord sounds a little bit

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:10,919
like Inception well it's all the

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,370
important stuff so the network protocol

00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:17,909
side divided the interface definition of

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:21,210
each other which then parses by some

00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:24,570
compiler and produces a lot of seafood

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:28,279
it's about 1 million something lines of

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:30,929
support for these it out those divisions

00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,179
so you should start the porting in the

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,000
generator and not on the result no

00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:39,990
doesn't make some generators one part

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,690
that this is a little cutter cutter

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:47,700
Victorian diva part of it is but has not

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:52,639
yet submitted via the generator of vital

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:57,419
modules upstream so this part is still

00:28:52,639 --> 00:29:00,960
supporting libraries yeah better is

00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:03,480
member of our team yeah and the rest is

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,730
not there yet so I don't think it and

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,370
look at this from the other side because

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:12,659
Paris also considerable amount of

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:15,470
support the actual admin runs in sample

00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:19,409
to utility which is written in tightly

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:26,700
which if we modernize that code first

00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:30,210
and style autumn the pure python code in

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:35,100
modules and then 2d convergence from

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,990
both sides on the scene would use if you

00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,050
are able to test it in the middle of the

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:43,170
process well in using

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:47,520
yes because somebody has comprehensive

00:29:43,170 --> 00:30:05,220
from this room which ones like I think

00:29:47,520 --> 00:30:07,140
around 5,000 now I really don't know if

00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:14,580
this was a question or just yet

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:16,770
description of the situation sounds

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,960
reasonable from what I heard now I

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:23,820
didn't see the code and stuff it sounds

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:32,400
reasonable but I cannot just say it for

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:34,700
a hundred percent sure where were we so

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,080
the process if it's not so complicated

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,180
you're somebody's case is very

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,080
complicated but if you have a let's say

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:47,880
pure python little project is to run

00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,760
modernize yes and run run tests for see

00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,190
if you didn't break pass on to you and

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,460
then run tests on Python free the test

00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:00,780
on Python free will probably produce

00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:04,350
some failures with some exceptions etc

00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:06,840
and then you start fixing those cases

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:09,000
it's a good idea to see if when you are

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,950
fixing particle things like replacing

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,650
test with death to see if it's not a

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,990
repetitive pattern in the in the code if

00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,180
you shouldn't like find and replace it

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,590
everywhere or whatever in you run tests

00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,360
you run tests until oral tests are green

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,430
in and all the tests are green on TV and

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,590
free then you actually try to use the

00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,570
thing sometimes it's hard if you don't

00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,820
know what the project is supposed to do

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:36,630
but if it's your project you probably

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,160
know that so yeah you're laughing but I

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,020
was boarding stuff that was supposed to

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,480
run in some cloud platform somewhere I

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,250
did this and dad I couldn't understand

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,800
it all the tests were green but when you

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,540
run it it actually crushed but all the

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,660
tests for cream yeah

00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:55,330
so then you run it and try to figure out

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,300
it everything is working so basically

00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,340
you are doing some manual testing and if

00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,380
that works you're probably ready to

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,560
submit it to upstream or if you are

00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,930
upstream then go ahead and merge it to

00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:11,850
master devil branch or whatever the

00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:15,520
upstream is using and then others will

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,050
probably use it as well and they will

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:22,810
report bucks if everything is broken

00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:27,490
which happens also sometimes once this

00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:30,160
is ready and release is ready on Python

00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:32,650
package index or whatever there comes

00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,660
the second part for fedora mostly is to

00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:38,860
introduce the Python free sub package or

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,510
whatever and make it also run and be

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:46,780
available in federal and then it turns

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:51,660
green in here and everyone is happy so

00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,660
you want to see some real coding thing

00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,390
you could come here because we can plug

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:11,560
in your monitor and we can work on it

00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:17,910
like everyone together that's it that's

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:20,590
it but some boob show up you know I

00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:25,240
probably quiet and say hello to my local

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:29,740
cozy server and it doesn't it for free

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:32,500
though because effectively because of

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:40,480
Rachel things we do with

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:42,220
ssl the ssl this so are you the link to

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,200
come here and so we can all do this

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,200
together or you prefer to work alone I

00:33:47,100 --> 00:34:03,220
guess it'll be fun right we have a rehab

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:07,180
alum ethernet cable you can sure bet

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:12,159
your decks oh it's not a keyboard babies

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:15,040
did ya you're just sit there you can sit

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:19,530
here and I just have enjoyed I just want

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:24,340
to show something I mean cutting meat I

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:27,159
feed enough yeah if you are a collector

00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:30,250
of veggies for fedora you can also

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,370
receive a badge we have we have a

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,470
special batch for protein Python Python

00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:40,840
3 days one of the best batch names I've

00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:43,540
ever seen it was his idea many elegant

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:53,620
border yes you feel stupid but I don't

00:34:43,540 --> 00:35:05,980
have to change houses come on come yeah

00:34:53,620 --> 00:35:07,600
okay so um I think most likely that this

00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,920
may just get really complicated and her

00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,630
into port port in Python requests oh we

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,430
can actually do that or if you have a

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:18,910
seat code the good thing to do is to

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:23,740
drop it and produce item and drop

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:24,310
someone or just happen so here's use the

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,070
pink

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:29,800
supports like 60 different operating

00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:33,370
systems and platforms not all of them

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,730
have Python 3 at all some of them may be

00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:38,320
there don't look at mode like 24 gotta

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:46,540
have been born first while we settle

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:49,480
down 126 now baseline yeah and it still

00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:56,500
has to work because the build system for

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:58,900
zombies with an entitlement well that

00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:03,370
that part already at the level that it

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:08,830
can work or just go ahead and for it to

00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:13,060
go all right what is that what's a

00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:16,780
resolution on this thing nativist 1024

00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:22,420
to sew 768 Oromis dinner it's written on

00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:28,960
a paper in here okay yeah just do that

00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:30,280
what is it all sounds exciting let's see

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,910
if I can work at that resolution without

00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,910
dying see everything in here okay

00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:55,200
all right um so what I did this is the

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:57,420
the one commits it part modernize did a

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,520
couple on things I had to fix but and

00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,460
this is a really a small subset of Koji

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,799
it's it's just the CLI command and the

00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,190
few the handful libraries that the CLI

00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:12,000
command actually uses so this is what

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:14,190
it's doing my okay see ya loudly I guess

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,930
things move cool so this is only basic

00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,809
people organized it yeah pretty much

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,160
yeah I fixed a couple things oh one

00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:23,760
thing it did was it put those from

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,109
future imports above the hash bang it's

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,000
just probably something that's should be

00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:30,990
easy to face in learn what what yeah

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:37,829
somebody gonna do you need incorporated

00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:40,950
function 2626 so it's not only 27 yeah

00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:48,240
given its quite a lot of print in a CLI

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:52,410
so that looks like a lot of this Oh does

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,779
it with least in into four cycles like

00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,490
can you go up oh here it is it like an

00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:58,559
explicit list because I suppose that

00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:00,569
turns it into that might not be required

00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,750
in this case but it might oh yeah it's

00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:06,420
just probably better safe than sorry HP

00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:14,460
and go through each block it's just the

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:16,440
prince okay it makes like the brain dot

00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:22,079
pattern you have to go into smaller

00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:23,880
alright so lots of friends lots of

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,140
prints so let's see so here's what

00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:32,670
happens if I so this is if I run it with

00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:37,079
your Python to that works I run it

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,940
through Python 3 the warning is expected

00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,920
much of it yeah I don't think that

00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,900
module supported yet and yeah it is

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,480
because this code is doing evil things

00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,480
to the privates yes

00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:56,020
Gary 5 care BB yeah yes Jason sorry

00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:00,910
could you could you bundles ssl adorable

00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:04,300
release it comes you ducky it's on oh

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:06,970
yeah care BB may never come to python 3

00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,680
and that's fine I think we I think we

00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,660
know this is so as Python Kerberos or

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,130
the other way yet then that one good we

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:17,440
10 GS essays about and that one will do

00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,330
proper gssapi just like a web browser

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,730
does and then we're at Point you and

00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:25,030
we'll look that's up that's all I can't

00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:28,000
do that boarding here I'm just saying

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,730
I'm a kerberos guy okay that's my day

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,300
job okay so so let me get your please

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:40,740
don't let me get your card yeah do you

00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:42,880
know Mike the knight he's the packaging

00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,790
no I think he's the guy that wrote

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,440
Python curb di think or you know diddly

00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,300
they didn't may not wrote it but I don't

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,270
you know I don't see his most of my day

00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:57,610
job i do i work on kz okay so is this

00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,650
something versus a mic but how about I

00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:06,220
want to try this we try there's no off

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:09,760
so that's going to we should figure out

00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:15,370
like how to replace this so it's flour

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:18,600
sugar all right ah but it actually got

00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:23,130
some multi-object so it's not long right

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:26,350
so there's something see if I can do

00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:30,330
yeah that's what I'm saying there's no

00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,330
off topicals not let me know if I can

00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:43,230
so now we gonna private out of Justice

00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:54,030
all right or try commenting these things

00:40:43,230 --> 00:41:06,960
out see if that gets it to still wrong I

00:40:54,030 --> 00:41:27,600
don't know I got your arm so just let me

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:35,310
just hack this really badly here yes all

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:38,310
right what will you give this because we

00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:41,250
are necessary come on unconditionally

00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:50,310
way about this yeah yeah it's just about

00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:52,670
I was at the import yes okay but okay it

00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:55,900
has to be in Puerto cut well then we can

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:58,670
make is the second launch

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:01,990
well no well that's that's actually how

00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:06,770
we get the actual ssl module that that's

00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:09,890
because we have in Python 2 with the

00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,270
import it I had to do that so I could

00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,220
import the ssl module because we had a

00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:16,490
module named ssl because there is a

00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:19,660
simple in Python so it would be

00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:22,820
important we don't you do it right oh

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,280
that's fixable maybe you're just on it

00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:32,120
you're all up tues and it's something

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:36,050
but my son you can use the extra notch

00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:39,410
came over here to wait 10 minutes my

00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:42,770
free oh of course back in three you are

00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,570
like to you version five little package

00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:57,560
I don't think this is a actual present

00:42:44,570 --> 00:43:03,260
free thing right did they change yeah it

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:04,910
emerged the API URL at one yeah it's a

00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:13,400
there a user isn't there a URL looking

00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:15,710
three now yeah okay I just didn't pick

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,680
that so uh so he might know offhand how

00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:21,850
I the whole list of them six has a page

00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:43,280
with a list of all their on you its

00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:45,430
sixth up moves like this 66 a table

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,430
right

00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:55,260
yeah it's going back to the throne as

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:57,360
URL ago and I think there's a table at

00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,720
the bottom makes it easier to get over

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,940
there I know it's taken somewhere on

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,370
table bulls about this least that was a

00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:09,150
different table so what actually you are

00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:13,250
using from your g a good question give

00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,250
me that because they're all different

00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:27,800
this is in are you all openurl here's

00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:34,730
your own now go back to the patient that

00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:34,730
control of Europe in the dogs

00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,520
yeah yes Apple click that one so you

00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,290
want to be right would request you want

00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:53,530
from six top news that URL link up

00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:56,620
requesting for URL or you know you don't

00:44:53,530 --> 00:45:03,580
want you all to be nasally all right so

00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:07,290
from six dot moves URL lib import know

00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:10,060
from 16 office but you don't request yep

00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:15,280
import URL open and then you change the

00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:26,770
code yes you are you're probably going

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:35,370
to get you out parson yep a URL adult

00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:35,370
hora c ya URL bar

00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,489
optics definitely not have any tips

00:45:50,349 --> 00:46:01,999
there's a high tariffs on those we just

00:45:56,689 --> 00:46:05,959
googles the Euro lip sucks like me like

00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:23,239
I wanted to some hackish website I have

00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:25,400
no idea euro cars i dredge I mean dead

00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:29,479
one is not supported that's it so yeah

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:32,689
alright thanks everybody let's check

00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:34,489
what is used from euro driver I think

00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:37,369
you can replace it with biker or

00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:44,900
whatever how about i just commented out

00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:49,009
we go next 100 SS or else it's in yeah

00:46:44,900 --> 00:47:01,309
CLI okay well I won't matter we just we

00:46:49,009 --> 00:47:11,209
don't easy we don't need that red one is

00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:17,059
those 42 you know ah yummy that yeah if

00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:20,529
your code is not good okay okay back URL

00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:20,529
squid I guess it's gonna be the same

00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:26,140
running anyway yeah there is a project

00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,000
will get half that interprets Python in

00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,980
every time there is an exception or

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,440
something it give meets the blind word

00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:53,230
because it's a bad code right go ahead

00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:56,230
you can individually ideas on the board

00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:59,800
isn't ya get it splits the port off of

00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:07,450
it as like this at one point in the

00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:15,160
ancient that line is probably pushing on

00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:23,170
11 years old right now yeah let's see

00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:25,480
what we're doing here I guess actually

00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,640
it's not at all so I just want them just

00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:32,260
want to put the hosts oi can do

00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:36,070
something else so is it also in the

00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:39,160
moves thing or it's just not there

00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:43,240
earlier whoa what we are all that split

00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:47,280
give me I think it will split like I'm

00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,280
yours witness says it gets you

00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:55,020
so Kourt is the last one so I don't know

00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,119
what has nothing is this like a

00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,369
trucker's return an object with those

00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,990
ecstatic dog he returns my people

00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,390
without a little hat so then but then

00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:05,849
you can use a convenient nobody has a

00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:09,930
subclass of twofold yeah that I've seen

00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:12,599
yeah some lips do that so so you have to

00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,130
do I think the only reason I didn't do

00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:15,359
that here was because at some point I

00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,819
cared about a version of Python where

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,829
they didn't have very a lot and I wanted

00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:21,450
to use the what seemed to be the safest

00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:24,450
version of us that's why it has the goo

00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:26,250
goo yes not change the tooth okay

00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:35,190
because people are unpacking the to form

00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:40,680
a another probe would be y equals so is

00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:43,640
it so I mean you have to get the roots

00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,640
are hosting important all right

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:09,080
oh we didn't do the sixth up moves for

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:12,110
the URL split all right so your else

00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:15,190
quit is from cigs up we've got URL it

00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:22,100
apart and put I I think you used it's um

00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:26,200
hold on I don't think I just coffee but

00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,200
look at the function called re-import oh

00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:39,920
that's oh it was called only that's

00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:42,500
pretty cold oh I yeah that's why I want

00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:48,860
URL split yes except I already had that

00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:52,070
so maybe I just I really did here was

00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:55,010
the fourth street or split porter fly

00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:59,360
okay where's your cursor so I got so I

00:50:55,010 --> 00:51:01,070
got seem and oh right because I don't it

00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,960
didn't use just split the port off I

00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:05,600
think it I haven't but so I've already

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:12,920
got that so got the question yet we go

00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:16,820
to sure nobody's sort of unique position

00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,530
within the door sure is there really any

00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:22,460
point to maintaining I found two

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:24,530
compatibility yes because people because

00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:28,130
people with lots of people the full

00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:30,380
facades fedora use Kochi yeah and i

00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:34,400
personally use it on some r l five

00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:36,170
systems quite a lot now i'm hoping to

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,670
get rid of that and i'm probably going

00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,320
to have to have to because i think what

00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,270
you might that's believe it that's not

00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,070
going to work on real five even just

00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,390
just as a general point outside of the

00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,589
kochi case that might be a question

00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:48,900
that's

00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:52,319
does it ask is where you begin this

00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:54,839
boarding right yeah it's something that

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:58,259
you know like let's say it's an end

00:51:54,839 --> 00:52:01,259
application that's something bigger and

00:51:58,259 --> 00:52:03,749
a run pls right hi there's not worth the

00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:06,180
effort to try and do the because there

00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:08,099
isn't for them to go but I've had

00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,989
numerous conversations about Koji and

00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:11,249
Python 3 for a while now people have

00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:12,239
been asking for a while you guys have

00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:17,789
been working on this stuff for a while

00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:20,279
now and so there's a bunch of arguments

00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:21,680
for the different approaches and the one

00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:23,789
thing that really resonates with me

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,410
which the which makes me wish I could

00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:27,690
just put Python 3 and be done with it is

00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,430
that when you do this works here and

00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:31,170
works there thing you're sort of your

00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,579
giving lowest common denominator you're

00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,170
saying I'm going to have this round pipe

00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:36,029
python3 but I'm not going to get to use

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:45,739
all the awesome things that Python 3 can

00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:48,089
give me oh yeah where's the mostest so

00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:49,019
and I mean I've been feeling that for a

00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:51,479
while because I've carried about

00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:53,640
multiple versions of python 2.x for a

00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:56,729
while and it that also sucks not nearly

00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,920
as bad as this so I'd love to just ditch

00:52:56,729 --> 00:53:10,079
it but I can't and I wish I could quit

00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:13,049
you Ralph eyes but I can how big is the

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,569
cogeco based would have been like I'll

00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:17,640
to to support to version of Koji one

00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:19,769
would be like only bug fixes so for

00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:24,930
vital to what probably going to happen

00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:27,329
is um probably going to split the

00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:32,039
codebase up into smaller chunks and have

00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:33,869
a really simple probably end up with

00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,569
some really simple client only library

00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:39,420
version of Koji that is it's for Python

00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:41,579
2 if and that will work on you know all

00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,819
the rails so if you can talk to koji

00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:46,229
there but then there's also the fun part

00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:48,059
is i probably want to do more than just

00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:50,969
talk to co gian real 5 I probably want

00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:53,489
to still maintain the ability to run a

00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:55,589
builder on rail 5 because at some point

00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:58,259
in my life something is going to need to

00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:59,390
build I'm going to it's not going to

00:53:58,259 --> 00:54:02,260
build with

00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:07,220
new kernel I'm gonna get freaking thing

00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:09,019
so yeah so welcome to my life well I

00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,460
think it's maybe a good discussion is a

00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:14,720
sort of things to come up outside of the

00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:17,450
code but i'll stop now one thing about

00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,390
the code you've been changing stuff and

00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:24,260
it's a good idea to sometimes check

00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:25,940
again for if you do to the break to you

00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,619
know since we are changing this you

00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:33,980
showed us it works on to you at the

00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:36,799
beginning oh yeah yeah now do you see

00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,250
JFK we just broke it yeah you remove the

00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:44,029
line were you assigned a port from the

00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:54,680
splitboard function there are you see

00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:57,140
the porn XO explicit form here where

00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,809
where you split the port on to host and

00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:03,309
port ok yes thank you oh right I thought

00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:03,309
that was also self all right everyone

00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:17,350
no that died sign the back before or

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,970
just that you don't use it later let's

00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:23,110
change it later the deadline blow that

00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:25,930
is one which is no no you go bake

00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:29,020
yourself and keep the self and chest as

00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:33,040
your next why she chose change the style

00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:36,160
yes yeah in the argument of the Beaufort

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:50,560
look at that yeah there should be soft

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:53,880
boil okay oh that's just that's just the

00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,880
type of I made a few minutes ago yeah

00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:19,480
yeah there are more pores yeah I said it

00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:21,310
there we go it's it that self the self

00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,230
one isn't set till later and it's

00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,400
complicated because there's there's an

00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,430
override or something like that all

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,430
right

00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:35,480
circuits for too long yeah he's hanging

00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:46,410
I wonder why because I let's try but

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:50,190
let's just see if we're through oh oh

00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:53,490
yes it was real invite on tues yep yeah

00:56:50,190 --> 00:57:09,390
I mean what is patent you create / 5

00:56:53,490 --> 00:57:16,220
full text yeah what version of fighting

00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:16,220
to you but I fed / 22 so powerful

00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:24,230
because most probably the thing is that

00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:30,180
the armor fry context is in Titan 2.5

00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:32,280
I'm nordea speaking of other meta topics

00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:36,450
one thing we've talked about for the

00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:40,500
real 5 case is is using sels on auto

00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:43,400
rels to get Python 3 or just back

00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:46,200
boarding Python 32 in any other way to

00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,480
to real any real targets we care about

00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,760
so that you can again do the less

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:57,300
painful and my way but we have a seal

00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:59,520
I'd I you know I did what I probably not

00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,940
45 we have we probably have it or sixth

00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,940
time no there's only four real sense

00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:08,660
example yeah but I mean if it exists on

00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:11,099
a semi has done the work to do it on us

00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,810
if it's on six then there's a chance you

00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:15,560
could you know do a little work and make

00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,560
that build on five

00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:30,240
fine yeah that's do you find yeah so I

00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,200
don't want to let sees it to check go to

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:37,200
software collections before you know

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:44,310
what all this spices oh oh this is not

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:46,140
the system library yes Debbie i renamed

00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:48,660
it because we had a name combined name

00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,580
conflict so that's just pythons ssl it's

00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,070
like normally imported ssl that's what

00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:55,260
you get iron stencil is the subsystem

00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:58,050
librarian yes these pythons ssl library

00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:02,550
that's what's supposed to be so I I do

00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:04,650
an import ssl in my ssl library that

00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:07,350
masked that why nitrogenous is the

00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:19,230
library of Python 3 there is great 115

00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:23,070
count okay so you can get syntax errors

00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:25,500
when you just start so I have a I have a

00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:28,980
Python RC that that does some nice

00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,770
things the heart that I think it tries

00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:33,210
to import a reports the red line nice

00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:35,790
red light module that gives you all

00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:38,130
sorts of nice tab completion in Python

00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:41,340
to tandy but it breaks if I thought

00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:46,580
three except I'm gonna tag Felicia now

00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:46,580
anyway so it doesn't

00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:59,830
crazy Rangers there is no 1 over 5 yeah

00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:04,060
can I sis so you can see it here yes I

00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:06,700
can see it on Python 3.4 if your Python

01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:11,340
installation was the exact version of

01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,340
Python 3 43 42 three 42 was in our

01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:41,500
campuses are can you it's hasn't it was

01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:43,750
but I don't build in December but

01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:48,940
changelog is from Julia I have it will

01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:53,200
do the unrepentant yeah that's great

01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:59,580
maybe it's mmm maybe it's hidden I don't

01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,580
think so I i think it was added in 3.43

01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:13,540
yeah so there's another way i do that

01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:16,000
though I could do default context i will

01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:22,270
sell double check what does over if I

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:25,740
told the school in fact I have I just

01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,740
have a comment in line try this one

01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:34,800
which week

01:01:48,210 --> 01:02:01,510
yeah I did I did I get the wrong

01:01:51,760 --> 01:02:03,400
direction key all right of course yeah

01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,960
the fact that we hit that means we're

01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:13,960
getting an exception because this is an

01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:18,000
exception the strings fun begins at this

01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:21,910
point you open the bubble some booze

01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,420
okay so what do you do you've right data

01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:30,210
koji yeah this is a yeah I'm writing to

01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:30,210
the I'm writing the socket to do stuff

01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:40,870
yeah what is through the guy is a

01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:47,950
strength or let's try to see if that

01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:49,780
helps hey we got some something curing

01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:52,090
we have two exceptions in spite of not

01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,590
all right so we're doing it yeah we're

01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:59,340
sources just ascending the percent this

01:02:53,590 --> 01:03:01,990
is sending the post request then we send

01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:04,630
so we did we got the post part I think

01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:10,380
you have too much because the Dalton two

01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:14,110
bites so I guess the data is the string

01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:17,020
anywhere you want to send binary or not

01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:19,240
binary by tonight so you have to decode

01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:22,930
data all right I think it's decoding

01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:26,650
with in code echo echo Jackson I never

01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:29,790
go flip react I always try like hell to

01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:33,550
heaven and comb your hair d code symbol

01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:36,910
that was sent yeah ah this is not this

01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:39,670
one it also know it's a let's see where

01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,740
is it in yeah but ill send one home yes

01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:44,619
but that's probably what the stuff is

01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:48,349
probably defined elsewhere 18

01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:51,380
yeah but you want to encode data as as

01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:56,419
light as possible other just ability to

01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:59,959
be concerning so what do I just handler

01:03:56,419 --> 01:04:11,390
goes into the and this is not the most

01:03:59,959 --> 01:04:17,359
aligned 1080s 17-18 so do those doors

01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:19,969
woman all right so send requests so

01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:24,109
should I just then coat it yeah I'm use

01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:30,410
you do eight yeah for now and later to

01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:34,009
get there yeah yeah let's look stylish

01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:40,609
but dash box the folk yeah ok let's try

01:04:34,009 --> 01:04:42,049
I don't know if there's something as

01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:50,019
else is going wrong mister Dombey taking

01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:50,019
that long and I'll it in bham it yet ha

01:04:51,729 --> 01:05:27,140
get it homey yeah what that was what's

01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:32,359
next alright commented on we don't need

01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:38,650
authentication let's see if twice on two

01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:38,650
still works no se issues

01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:45,819
all right I think that what is your

01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:53,679
first usually I'm giving everybody my

01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:56,559
cam let's try to make work come out from

01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:58,809
good you may quite another comment from

01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,309
from the clergy client this is the only

01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:03,999
comment I never used to go to glide

01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:06,519
inside neither okay what what what do

01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:10,150
you owe me to do like the comments you

01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:12,459
type do to descend these yeah then check

01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:14,890
there any other comments oh well there's

01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:16,179
lots um yeah that's just the simplest

01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,789
one that just says open the connection

01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:24,009
of the server sent from some send some

01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:26,709
message and see what happens um and yeah

01:06:24,009 --> 01:06:28,630
if I take no one's trying to switch on

01:06:26,709 --> 01:06:31,619
the awesome vacation well that we

01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:38,559
basically disabled that so it's not too

01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:45,459
available so we do know uh um this tags

01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:51,569
get some actual data back and so clean

01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:51,569
bench project off the X&Y bc debugging

01:06:53,069 --> 01:07:06,520
and and do that so which is certainly

01:06:57,579 --> 01:07:09,460
slow and I really is okay

01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:13,750
oh I was all locks like thai goofy nose

01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:15,460
no no it's the the I'm not using the

01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:19,870
network I mean it's all local to my

01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:21,940
laptop or or am I because you get oh I

01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,040
know why yeah that's why it's low

01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:26,980
because i'm using i'm not using my local

01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,930
one there we go it would help them is

01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,460
Lee if I talk to the ones running on my

01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:39,940
laptop instead the one that's running in

01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:46,200
Linux all right back to fast yes and

01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:49,540
most testing its local to Jesus yeah

01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:53,620
easy all right she's keyword run for key

01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:58,660
function is no longer a pink yeah inside

01:07:53,620 --> 01:08:02,290
told you I'd it's it's odd it's a cat to

01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:04,740
seem like it's weird I also weird

01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:07,870
artifact of one of the ways that you can

01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:16,680
use different coaching Oh client

01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:16,680
profiles it goes by the dollar 0 so 3815

01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:31,060
so what are you saying get rid of the

01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:34,990
lambda um Oh CNP was removed yes so tag

01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:41,859
sorting he can pass like a list of ease

01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:44,470
to do I decided that the sort method was

01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:47,650
removed now said there is a permit or

01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:51,760
insult fiction right there's something

01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:54,630
happens cmp as gone or samples go yeah

01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:58,510
okay CSV you are now given get a sword

01:08:54,630 --> 01:09:00,580
cmp function but you should give it

01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:04,300
something else you should do

01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:09,820
which we sort key equals big as night

01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:20,380
Tico's name it was it right yeah totally

01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:25,750
should be key strike as we're too heavy

01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:35,320
a little under that returns a lambda

01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:39,490
originals a nakie yeah he was a typo

01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:50,320
lambda chi minh lam luong boy hahahaha

01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:54,850
Lambada yeah this should work yeah yeah

01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:57,600
all right you see how urgent you see how

01:09:54,850 --> 01:10:04,930
much happiness Morgan good button free

01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:07,410
all right I think g7 works with key this

01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,410
I'll be fine

01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:30,250
okay all right I lost you a brief but

01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:39,820
was this free or 25 I told that was that

01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:41,760
was three that's a lot of there's a lot

01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:51,699
of that's one of the more complicated

01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:55,239
client codes too so that's done yeah or

01:10:51,699 --> 01:11:02,070
you gave me the badge right I'm now no

01:10:55,239 --> 01:11:04,120
longer motivated to do any foreign

01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:07,060
the fact that they have levels do you

01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:09,190
get like water is not yet yes Betty

01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:12,400
Aurora's so I was like how do we do love

01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:16,719
us do I keep a table with numbers of

01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:19,000
packages somewhere and we I wasn't

01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:37,360
thinking about making a gorgeous koji to

01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:41,460
fight ah let's see Louis you no no no no

01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,460
this suite for the client could you oh

01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:47,860
they're there they're all right there

01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:50,199
are a number of ad hoc tests that we

01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:53,530
have but we don't have that's that's the

01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:58,790
thing i know it's bad but but I'm very

01:11:53,530 --> 01:12:00,230
careful possibly go wrong

01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:02,240
I have some code that uses the Kody

01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,470
Klein you could try that at least you're

01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:12,260
not using it to build a mission-critical

01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:14,930
OS yeah there's a lot but the build

01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:16,340
songs images well that's going to fail

01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:19,970
because we haven't touched the Builder

01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:21,560
that also runs on here but I then i but

01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:23,300
then that I haven't installed it yet so

01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,400
we'll get the Python to go or so a big I

01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,380
think you would look like the client is

01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,900
written in Python 3 and summer is

01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:33,680
written in Python 2 or else what we are

01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:35,660
doing right now is it just me where we

01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,910
were talking to remo gaggi which was

01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:46,520
important to you yeah this is a good

01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:48,670
thing it does nothing it's it a test

01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,670
case

01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:10,210
right can't go without off yeah I mean

01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:13,150
we all right and relies so what is this

01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:18,220
ssl do have some wire for ssl library or

01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:21,100
I think you could like realize it with

01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:25,210
ssl back board or whatever went

01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:27,640
backwards we are talking Pam free and we

01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:30,630
have networking thanks for what let's

01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:41,950
see there's package I was called yeah

01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:43,720
unbiased contains like well had we fired

01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:48,660
off that bill we would have been able to

01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:55,450
watch it after a factory started so cool

01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:58,120
oh just a tad yeah the next thing we

01:13:55,450 --> 01:14:01,930
should do is make Kate up everything and

01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:07,510
then introduce keep it too because we're

01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:09,100
dude we've done that with Python ok dad

01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:13,390
just a little local tacky thing I have

01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:17,880
makes it easier it just does pythonpath

01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:17,880
equals my check out and runs from there

01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:24,120
all right well I think my brain is about

01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,120
done I'm going to

01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:40,980
one hour so let's go with something

01:14:28,349 --> 01:14:42,929
who's next please don't fumble oh really

01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:47,130
yeah but that means only the hard copies

01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:52,349
away yeah yeah yeah it means that Liam

01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:55,199
long tail so do we have some package we

01:14:52,349 --> 01:15:02,489
need for okay let's click choose someone

01:14:55,199 --> 01:15:07,230
I wouldn't go with come here come here

01:15:02,489 --> 01:15:13,610
we can put life you're looking like the

01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:21,059
whole you up so you can pour some good

01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:25,489
okay if it's easier than clear when you

01:15:21,059 --> 01:15:27,989
to like modernize wants to go I think

01:15:25,489 --> 01:15:32,130
yes because they are too does generate

01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:35,099
spyderco doesn't generate powerful for

01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:37,110
from biting cold so why would you ever

01:15:35,099 --> 01:15:41,099
want to do that I have no idea what I've

01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:42,929
seen it okay say nobody wants to pour

01:15:41,099 --> 01:15:45,270
something so let's just go and pour

01:15:42,929 --> 01:15:48,179
something and but we need to establish

01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:54,300
what what do we support i'll let you

01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:57,719
something barman sounds like oh sounds

01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:21,820
like beer and I exactly

01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:24,909
how many lies are there yeah okay see

01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:27,729
I've already 47 times nice okay so

01:16:24,909 --> 01:16:33,989
parting nuit let's just assume it will

01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:33,989
not such as any other sides I would pass

01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:51,639
okay so what do we part we can look at

01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:54,519
me take a look at the graph yum here

01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:58,840
well we ported Kochi yeah like 40

01:16:54,519 --> 01:17:00,670
minutes like he we should definitely add

01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,619
some functional if you like give me an

01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:04,929
easy package or something some

01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:07,030
revolution function which will like

01:17:04,929 --> 01:17:09,729
output you some package is here is here

01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:20,199
is right on 0 0 how about Sphinx web

01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:22,420
tools no that would be really you but I

01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:26,110
don't know how to make a change what is

01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:28,530
you can just hit update until yeah I

01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:31,210
mean it's generated right so Oh

01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:35,219
everybody sees the same package yeah

01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:38,650
nine ish shouldn't be so shift attack

01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:40,269
let's see scribbly I see springs weapons

01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:42,429
like weird isn't it needs to be

01:17:40,269 --> 01:17:49,929
different it is to be in JavaScript yeah

01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:54,190
units webs I'll be a v8 oh let's put the

01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:57,389
dough get ya a good idea that's very

01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:57,389
useful for other packages

01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:08,250
oh ok so it has you deserve you I'm here

01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:12,390
that would show you the most Rock

01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:14,070
package or the pack is dead yeah take a

01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:17,489
look at the graph it's just important to

01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:19,710
me slashing oh wow just then you see

01:18:17,489 --> 01:18:24,000
this level like hype sub packages are

01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:29,780
twisted or let's let's poor dog it has

01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:38,630
20 279 lines we can basically rewrite it

01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:47,190
down / grab for her it doesn't work

01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:51,360
repetition of position is it open up bro

01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:53,670
a so this is designed so that we can

01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,160
figure out which package box the most

01:18:53,670 --> 01:19:02,270
other things so the darkest one yes yes

01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:05,300
exactly so this is boosters and this is

01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:17,820
part on montford map which is supported

01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:21,440
yep koji vitam fedora vitam twister

01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:24,330
children as well mostly totally track

01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:28,860
all the high ground track our plug-ins

01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:30,719
for track it only blocks itself and was

01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,760
here nobody wants you three written Dean

01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:37,469
no idea what do this it's like maybe

01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:41,520
it's new system d hahahahaha and vegs

01:19:37,469 --> 01:19:45,120
fightin and boost we already seen sugar

01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,820
that's one laptop per child Pengy we can

01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,360
skip as well I guess through Charles

01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:58,560
non-patent e to the honestly they

01:19:51,360 --> 01:20:01,620
buy game I think yeah good and what is

01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:06,080
this mercurial that's why I python is

01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:10,310
moving to get because because

01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:16,220
because get is not written but oh really

01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:19,580
yeah it's Ruby right yup it is C and

01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:21,350
some peril I guess yeah and so mercurial

01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:23,840
isn't Python and it's fighting to only

01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:25,490
and they were like ah we don't like poor

01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,040
thing start to fighting because we

01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:33,790
introduced it and so let's just use get

01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:33,790
it okay I guess what was invited so

01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:46,610
Python Federer yep isn't the notified

01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:49,220
one should be very small I think dog air

01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:50,780
would be easy to port let's just start

01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:53,570
of that and what does what is the do it

01:20:50,780 --> 01:21:02,090
in conda's header off items means a lot

01:20:53,570 --> 01:21:06,310
of tools for in front I guess that's why

01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:06,310
it's called fedora because it has to be

01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:23,560
let's look for it we are probably 14 is

01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:26,540
on the rails you're looking at filed up

01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:28,400
or Python oiled up and it has a

01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:30,380
frequently asked questions on his

01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,810
website and one of the question is is

01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:37,960
this compatible with fighting one what

01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:41,600
they read this question Eddie I no way

01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:43,520
there are lots of dirty so we have pie

01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,440
Theodora we have vital for our chango

01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,360
pipe of your flies I mean through

01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:51,500
brokers and turbo juice which is you

01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:54,680
never try to trim it around right huh so

01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:57,350
we have Python free fedora but it is a

01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:59,420
rat because we don't have Python free

01:21:57,350 --> 01:22:01,580
fedora chango python free federer flask

01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:03,920
and fighting free figure out what what

01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:06,200
so ever it may be possible that the

01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,990
package maintainer just created by 23

01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:13,100
fedora sub package and forget all the

01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:14,930
others so the good way would be to see

01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:18,869
Federer in federal packaging database

01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:28,439
see if it's tashia or somebody else

01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:34,469
yeah Ralph rob is here go get him stem

01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:52,949
our Python and not fighting free what

01:22:34,469 --> 01:22:58,320
years 20 years I don't know what flash

01:22:52,949 --> 01:23:01,169
Django works so python is a collection

01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:06,599
of Python code that allows program to

01:23:01,169 --> 01:23:11,129
talk to federal services let's go don't

01:23:06,599 --> 01:23:17,510
get let's go over it again so why woody

01:23:11,129 --> 01:23:17,510
I go locate dog in the database and I

01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:22,769
will check if it doesn't depend on any

01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:25,769
package it's not the rat so it's fine

01:23:22,769 --> 01:23:28,590
which is going to we can pour it

01:23:25,769 --> 01:23:31,949
directly there is no up streaming here

01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:34,559
so I go to federal packaging database I

01:23:31,949 --> 01:23:36,360
go to upstream I will check if there

01:23:34,559 --> 01:23:38,939
isn't any issue you about Python free

01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:42,539
that's a good idea there are no issues

01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:44,789
whatsoever like 93 let's see if there is

01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:47,459
like closed ones fix issue we don't like

01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:52,110
Python free so code what what does it

01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:56,369
say set up I it says 53 in here so it

01:23:52,110 --> 01:24:00,499
might be only a packaging thing so let's

01:23:56,369 --> 01:24:00,499
just get Duggar a cloned and

01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:24,770
alright checkup I i think the bin file

01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:29,960
single file and do get folder anything

01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:36,620
else in it in it wow wow wow wow how do

01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:47,090
i run it direct well okay so inside this

01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:53,360
user so i will just run python free set

01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:57,200
up by install user and now i should have

01:24:53,360 --> 01:25:00,980
to commend oh so we successfully ported

01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:02,600
okay by running it hahaha so I know most

01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:04,220
of you said you're not so into the

01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:12,160
packaging stuff but while we are there

01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:19,040
we can definitely just go to Charm

01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:23,300
fedora fcm fat package clone thank you

01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:28,730
alone I feel so alone or wherever

01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:49,010
cloning okay forever alone go there see

01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:52,790
what's there not much and so here so

01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:59,600
let's let's just put number free in here

01:25:52,790 --> 01:26:02,270
number free in here and bless you enjoy

01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,040
and put put put your comment I going to

01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:06,020
write a natural language processor that

01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:09,620
searches through all the files to find

01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:12,080
jokes so what does this do you it

01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:15,080
reboots that's into it just removes

01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,880
shebang so you don't need to fix that MV

01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:19,060
doesn't know you

01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:21,580
use the new micros pie in style by bill

01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:23,320
so you don't have known them directly do

01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:26,560
you remember them from PI and /

01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:30,340
instalike by building by by underscore

01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:37,210
built by underscore installed x 3 and x

01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:46,840
3 because you need dog a dog asianet

01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:49,260
play alright so it's here and where is

01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:54,070
the macro example spectral down here

01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:56,560
auto setup pi PI free install and by

01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:59,950
three goat yeah okay thank you so this

01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:07,330
is 22 passes desert or it jump does it

01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:10,990
for me man cool fire free bill right so

01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:16,420
we need this and we do we need this and

01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:19,600
by cash or does it leave that should

01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:22,180
include anything like this is there like

01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:26,290
pie pie three files or something macro

01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:38,200
okay and that's about it I guess let's

01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:43,690
just try yeah no package so just don't

01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:49,150

guideline who does it do you about pie

01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:58,660
cash it does nothing about by cash so we

01:27:54,340 --> 01:28:02,200
are doing it right and now s approval

01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:04,720

01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:09,840

the specs for everything Yeah Yeah right

01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:25,269
so we only have license is a license and

01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:27,699
read me as a doc

01:28:25,269 --> 01:28:35,499
oh that's Ian's package just push it in

01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:41,159
compliance yeah dump truck you were just

01:28:35,499 --> 01:28:44,619
a little slower than me okay so oh we

01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:56,709
know much something better than much

01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:59,499
Bible free much more I think we

01:28:56,709 --> 01:29:01,989
shouldn't believe the building Yeah Yeah

01:28:59,499 --> 01:29:12,909
right too much fighting three you're on

01:29:01,989 --> 01:29:16,149

01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:25,839
changed your teammate or work what do

01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:27,609
you say actually and this is to hear

01:29:25,839 --> 01:29:34,389
beautiful initial package built Wow

01:29:27,609 --> 01:29:39,760
punch fight on macros and let's be

01:29:34,389 --> 01:29:42,879
consistent and what was and put it in

01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:45,789
one line now we're now he's using one

01:29:42,879 --> 01:29:49,869
long time without many demos manager

01:29:45,789 --> 01:29:53,919
menulis trace back okay such modern very

01:29:49,869 --> 01:29:57,609
Python 3 and much wow where he license

01:29:53,919 --> 01:29:59,769
and now what I have you also changed the

01:29:57,609 --> 01:30:02,079
release work and oh yeah I do this

01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:05,379
before keystroke okay together with the

01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:08,499
change locks on wow wow I proud such

01:30:05,379 --> 01:30:11,379
ninja especially job okay what what's

01:30:08,499 --> 01:30:15,129
the description doug is simple and it

01:30:11,379 --> 01:30:19,029
around some fighting free okay cool cool

01:30:15,129 --> 01:30:21,459
now the other thing is we run dog ever

01:30:19,029 --> 01:30:24,249
forget and I'm not sure if this 220

01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:30,309
version supports pile and free it'll be

01:30:24,249 --> 01:30:32,169
a good idea is this some if if you have

01:30:30,309 --> 01:30:33,250
not run off 36 hours or something like

01:30:32,169 --> 01:30:36,560
that

01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:40,070
having a plan to package slow no this is

01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,750
an application and no reason to run both

01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:50,360
of them so you just choose the better

01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:52,610
button is like the DNS because there is

01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:55,790
application but it also contains the

01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:57,740
libraries so DNA is self is running on

01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:59,780
vital dream but it provides also

01:30:57,740 --> 01:31:07,340
fighting together because people are

01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:12,040
using the library so I'm did it also I

01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:12,040
don't know if I have to but I go

01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:29,750
switchin yeah because I'm bumping it and

01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:32,960
much new version many developments is

01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:35,450
the current line yeah yes what what he

01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:39,860
develop ons okay sorry about that my

01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:46,270
mistake you have to be consistent more

01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:46,270
money develop ends ok now let's just oh

01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:59,030
spike you get this horse it's not found

01:31:53,420 --> 01:32:09,400

01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:17,420
here ok never mind just give it a 5 and

01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:19,490
update it in the in the spec and check

01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:22,070
on github if this version also supports

01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:29,540

01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:35,860
Google 45 not that i won did it find

01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:56,630
introduce support and then drop it and

01:32:54,080 --> 01:33:01,370
