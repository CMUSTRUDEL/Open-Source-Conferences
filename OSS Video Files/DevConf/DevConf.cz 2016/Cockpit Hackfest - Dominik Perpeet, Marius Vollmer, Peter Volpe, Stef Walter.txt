postel roasted a shinigami text editor

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:39,719
as you know how to reduce Elena Nene

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,719
toshiba

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:08,589
some slides to be just after the

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,589
presentation

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,010
in the Builder

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,770
Morgan

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,040
I

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,870
kitchen

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,130
security updates

00:15:13,030 --> 00:16:09,510
oh come on

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:56,870
let's yeah ok let's make it yeah or

00:16:47,610 --> 00:17:00,320
maybe yeah or eating machine oh that's

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,320
how it gets

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,069
this is ready knocker it's pretty

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,720
so really

00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,980
Oh

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,430
right now

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Oh

00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:35,710
so using the show you see the shells

00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:46,120
down below so che wow weird acts will do

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:46,120
buttons like nobodys blended

00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,520
so do you think

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Oh

00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,680
yeah oh yeah

00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,850
I

00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Oh

00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,610
I

00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,710
it was there

00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,509
Oh

00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,860
like this

00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:25,789
Oh

00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,000
that's fine

00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,450
yes

00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,240
Oh

00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:24,339
yes

00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,450
Oh

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,359
somebody else

00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:37,540
let's see

00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:53,859
Oh

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,599
Snickers

00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,950
stay on your flight

00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:09,430
love

01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:19,170
so this is how you use fond something

01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:27,390
right and it produce the output if you

01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:32,369
there's a secondary in here that you can

01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:34,580
put stuff like that in okay and so you

01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:34,580
can

01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:57,599
when you post office vendors also

01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:10,800
it's a top level like this is it top

01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,800
level like that no yeah

01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:47,070
oh I guess it has all sorts of internal

01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:47,070
details and then what you call a list

01:03:52,380 --> 01:04:00,130
yeah so that's kind of scenario that

01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:01,690
we're coming in to fix if people are

01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:04,380
going to try and interactive this from

01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:04,380
their plugin school

01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,300
ok

01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:54,020
anyway we should make it easier

01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,140
the

01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:35,240
so like this

01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:43,400
in soon as you get

01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:59,119
okay anyway but yeah basically it's

01:06:49,009 --> 01:07:01,759
there we just let me make it better so

01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:05,630
when you are you free if you're hacking

01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:08,479
on this when you go into the guide you

01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:10,220
can well you can wait for the network or

01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:12,609
but that's all those options are

01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,609
documented

01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:21,159
so

01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:44,369
yes

01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:02,829
but you can do any command line pass

01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,829
through here

01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:13,500
this is a package so what I'm running

01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:13,500
here

01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:30,300
watch for me at least that's the case

01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:33,679
that's why it's on this computer I I

01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,679
guess sometimes it's not

01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,840
but yeah see

01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:23,909
so like not for example i mean i think

01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:26,099
this this goes along the same lines you

01:11:23,909 --> 01:11:28,830
can see here that we have multiple

01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:31,139
machines first one is connected via web

01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:32,639
socket on part 19 thank you definitely

01:11:31,139 --> 01:11:36,630
add the other machines it's just thanks

01:11:32,639 --> 01:11:38,599
to them and we launched the bridge is

01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:41,639
what's actually processing the users

01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:45,420
request so most of the stuff is running

01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:47,580
in the JavaScript all of the interesting

01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,110
stuff like oh I want to have this APR I

01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,119
want to read this file in one spot this

01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:53,070
mess but that's all gone to school and

01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:56,610
then the bridge basically knows how to

01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:58,050
process like interesting tasks that the

01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,489
Java school gives it it doesn't know

01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:01,530
about system configuration or anything

01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:04,050
like that so the first time that that's

01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:05,429
done the browser that ows launches

01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:07,590
the bridge director in a colonizer

01:12:05,429 --> 01:12:10,290
session as the user with a user's

01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:11,940
privileges and everything but when we

01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:13,860
connect other servers we launched coffee

01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:17,369
bridge over a sin to talk to Don started

01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:21,640
in the sandbox and what that does is you

01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:25,900
end up here so this is the this is the

01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:30,640
demo we were showing yesterday someone

01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:39,010
in shape it's called and when I had

01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:40,990
another machine typist address you see

01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:45,700
that it actually logs into arrested

01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:49,000
we'll see the fingerprints that's the

01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:51,460
one I want to connect to and boom it

01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,290
used my safe authentication mr. try and

01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:56,650
log in the licensing let's do another

01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:59,710
one which has different off so I have

01:12:56,650 --> 01:13:07,420
two machines are you looking for even

01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:09,370
one and it's not laptop well because

01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:11,470
there's the bastion case and there's a

01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:13,870
cloud case the cloud case where you

01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,970
don't want the browser access to all

01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:17,230
your she's all the time but if it was

01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:18,520
some well you do have to dive into and

01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:21,760
figure out what like wrong with the

01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:25,180
longer safe so here for example we log

01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:27,070
into an atomic postcards nice it says

01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:29,530
well sorry firstly it's a different

01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:31,630
ossification different user and we even

01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:34,330
have an SSH agent loaded inside the

01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:35,860
cockpit session like aqua bridge thing

01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:37,420
the loads and SH I'm loading a new

01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,230
entity into it just as if I would run

01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,960
next HR

01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:43,780
and password it's all is actually

01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,560
discoverable you like they're not Jackie

01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:49,780
and time politicians they want to

01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,540
definitely but then girls like I have a

01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:55,480
clown insanity these are these are even

01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:57,400
different operating systems there's

01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:00,250
different capabilities because different

01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:02,500
you I was available really cervix and if

01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:06,030
you if I go into those instances you can

01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,030
see I've logged on one as your door oz

01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:15,070
the other one is and so which 58 similar

01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:17,080
right they have support for gssapi

01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:18,880
there's some buttons that people are

01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:20,320
punishing working off because when you

01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,780
log in my justice if yeah it's not easy

01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:26,050
to configure the system I think the deal

01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:27,940
if you don't get the wheel group you

01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:33,810
don't get the Polka taxes and a bunch of

01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:35,800
stuff like that but the idea is that the

01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:38,050
mechanisms that people usually use over

01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,250
ssh or that people usually use connected

01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:42,930
research but it's same ones that work

01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,930
the same ones we go

01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:26,100
many too close it's always did a whole

01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:29,970
bunch or kind of virus a whole bunch of

01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:31,200
working making Cochran really well some

01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:34,070
teachers are disabled because then he

01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,070
doesn't happen

01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:41,400
so we're at the point now where we have

01:15:37,989 --> 01:15:44,380
it ready to go into unstable but we need

01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:47,920
so we work with packaging upstream we

01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:51,940
actually test when you open a pull

01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:55,869
request against cockpit you get yeah

01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:57,789
like thinking like this and so you can

01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:59,229
see debian taxi there so we actually

01:15:57,789 --> 01:16:00,820
have a debian faculty upstream in a

01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:03,010
bunch of stuff like that and we want

01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:05,769
packaging very similarly so that we can

01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:08,440
test the experience of Louisa logica so

01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:10,780
we need we need a maintainer to take

01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:13,059
that on there are people who said it's

01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:16,770
no one else shows up I'll do it but you

01:16:13,059 --> 01:16:18,660
know we're waiting for someone to jaw

01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:20,340
and you know essentially work with us

01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,290
because we want to have demine as what i

01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:24,600
would like to actually really solidly

01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:28,530
test and if we do that of course which

01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:32,390
it will work well of you but the idea is

01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:32,390
yes limited or else

01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:51,810
yeah i mentioned to talk it cost them

01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:55,640
but i got sick computer do that purpose

01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:57,720
does the presentation to try to get

01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:59,750
understanding on what what's happening

01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:02,370
we actually had a real long concession

01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:04,260
in the browser this is a things this is

01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:07,410
like on the level of extra lemon wrong

01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:09,090
wayland essay or whatever is that

01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:10,560
interact with the system as you would

01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:14,489
expect and you know all this other stuff

01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:18,150
in and it just allows people to really

01:17:14,489 --> 01:17:19,380
easily bills you i interact interactive

01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:22,220
stuff troubleshooting stuff

01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:22,220
configurations

01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:43,530
you can like look here this is what i'm

01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,989
showing I mean I don't know but there's

01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:47,520
so many use cases for this is a terminal

01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:53,429
stone style we have this as a default

01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:56,070
option that's because the network itself

01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:58,020
horrible yeah but one of the examples

01:17:56,070 --> 01:18:00,360
that we have that we don't ship by

01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:03,120
default is the ability to load gtk apps

01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:05,790
I mean inside of the browser it's just

01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,830
part of this is actually in the routers

01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:10,260
like lucky if I change account like this

01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:14,420
is really these are really browser towns

01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:18,360
and gtk has support for html5 yeah but

01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:20,100
they don't have as a session so there's

01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,870
no ah there's a bunch of stuff so this

01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,120
that's that's the point here it's a

01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:28,590
session that allows the browser to

01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:30,540
basically be part of the system and it

01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:32,550
the easiest ways to write JavaScript

01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:35,969
based tools that you can also write

01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:39,750
terminal based stuff this is perfectly

01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:42,989
ex I mean sorry vt100 over say all that

01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:45,179
like you can load up a to e commander

01:18:42,989 --> 01:18:48,090
and all of that the same happens with

01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:54,120
this example the same happens with VNC

01:18:48,090 --> 01:19:05,910
you can you can render the end

01:18:54,120 --> 01:19:08,620
yeah remember to have examples right so

01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:11,230
if you wanted to render our machines you

01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:16,300
I you might do as I B&C in that class

01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:19,390
star but I mean as an example like here

01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:21,640
with the journal loading logs which are

01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:24,120
apparently a lot of we actually spawned

01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:26,260
journal control and lead a template

01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,390
that's the thing other stuff that's

01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:30,220
happening in the UI is interacting

01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:31,900
directly with the system and it's not

01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:44,410
like some big mid-tier that has to be

01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:46,330
written in excess what full times and

01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:47,980
litter open source projects of we have

01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:53,140
contributions from lots of other people

01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:59,050
too but I say this and one should we

01:19:53,140 --> 01:20:00,700
have a designer because we work sharpen

01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:02,860
abuses white sheet is trying to

01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:07,120
accomplish it will make it work and make

01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:10,660
it happen a sighted person minute

01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,660
helps found

01:20:40,219 --> 01:20:44,820
yeah and I hope I mean all of this stuff

01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:47,909
that was showing you can run it on your

01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:49,500
laptop it's not like this magic or we're

01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:52,099
Devils or stuff this is all set you can

01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,099
actually do

01:21:35,219 --> 01:21:38,219
so

01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:37,340
but

01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,890
you

01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:25,390
sure

01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:29,790
how

01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,989
