anything within reason ok so that way

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,909
they'd reason park given that who we are

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,639
yeah that reason is a very small never

00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:48,879
lasted it's universally acceptable

00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:51,280
questions is quite large so first 11 do

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,319
is going to ask each of us to start with

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,819
Ryan on the end cuz he's the tallest

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,409
that's why he's sitting at the end of

00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,859
the stage so it makes us all kind of

00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:02,560
look at uniform but we're not so I asked

00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:05,079

this group of

00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:33,609
driving me insane and crazy I started my

00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:52,329
to work at a company called novell where

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,219

redheads legacy Perl code to java and

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,129
then I came over to this new project

00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:08,199
we're trading called open shift and I

00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:11,379
wanted to try something new so I decided

00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:15,089
to be a developer evangelist and then we

00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:17,229
grew and I ended up being the manager

00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:24,819

00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:26,679

00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,179
oldest member of the event in terms of

00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:32,649

actually have a master's in forestry PhD

00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:43,059
in ecology and as part of my PhD work i

00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,939
wrote a lot of simulations and i ran the

00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:47,769
computer lab for my computer my

00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:50,110
ecology department I then went to Yale

00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,790
where I did internal IT projects for

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,339
Yale where I would build websites design

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,589
databases for faculty members and so

00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,689
then after that I got tired of just

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:01,930
doing that maybe became a developer

00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:04,360
evangelist at ESRI it's the Microsoft of

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,589
the GIS world spatial stuff and that was

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,389
about 10 years ago so I've been a

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:10,600
developer evangelist for about 10 years

00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:12,970
and I joined this team after that I was

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,490
a developer evangelist at jakarta has

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,139
anybody heard of Jakarta lbs company

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,329
maybe they were just recently acquired

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,639
by goober I left before that and I'm

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:24,100
thankful and then I work for LinkedIn

00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,569
for three months because that would be

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,970
an interesting story if anybody wants to

00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:29,819
know I with the developer evangelist

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,439
two months three months none because

00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,879
once you get those once the stocks

00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:35,310
actually get close to investing it

00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,160
becomes very hard to quit so I wanted to

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,800
quit before I got hooked and I became

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,810
miserable and so then I joined red hat

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,649
I'm at one here a month longer than

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:49,050
Merrick well and I'm die annular i am

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:51,810
the community manager for open shift and

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:54,180
the developer evangelist and so my

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:57,810
background I've I'm the oldest on the

00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,019
team and the only woman we're working on

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,209
that and I came from a small start-up

00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,550
company called active state any of you

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:06,959
ever use a few space Python Komodo and

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,019
all those kinds of things I was a

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,879
product manager there and did a lot of

00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,449
R&D work and I was the gal that

00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,810
convinced them to create a fork of cloud

00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:20,519
foundry and turn it into staccato and

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,379
did all that work and I worked on that

00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,860
project the cloud foundry the competing

00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:28,019
projects too I'm from the other side and

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,430
then I got you know tired of some of the

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,889
crap that was going on around in the

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,040
cloud foundry community and wanted to go

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:37,980
work in a real open source world and

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,410
came over to the red side and started

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,329
working on openshift and I've been here

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:47,790
almost three years down doing that and

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:51,689
very happily being a lot more open I

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:55,139
worked on an XML standard called xbrl so

00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:57,449
all really boring accounting stuff but

00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,360
it's used globally now in the US at the

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:02,459
SEC in China all across Europe you can

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,430
blame me for some of the most complex X

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:07,620
XML ever written in the entire world and

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,839
still being written for really boring

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,240
stuff like corporate reporting's all

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
kinds of filings and things like that so

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,170
I worked on that I came from a company

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,269
that was once called soft quad I worked

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,579
on a project a product called x-metal

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,639
anybody here know what X medalist XML

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,500
letters yeah I did that that company was

00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,449
acquired by perele that was then

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,990
acquired by another small company called

00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:34,350
blast radius and acquired by company in

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,180
japan called just systems I've been

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,640
wrapped so I was at the same

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,480
the entire time it just business cards

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,580
but so I did a lot of xml work before

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,710
that and during some of that I did a lot

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,950
of Python so you'll know me on twitter

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:54,270
is Python DJ and if you're following me

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:56,700
I'm sorry and you'll see pictures of my

00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,470
dog in unicorns and a lot of open shift

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,120
messaging so that's sort of my

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,940
background I've been around for a very

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,160
long time my very very first job outside

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,010
of university was at Nike this the

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,950
sporting to people I get a lot of cad

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:14,430
cam work and 3d design and on the side I

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,380
run at get naked labs which is a mobile

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,029
makerspace and so asking about that

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,930
afterwards and not be very passionate

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:23,790
about teaching kids how to do 3d design

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,649
so that's what I wanted you all to do is

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,779
I wanted you to introduce yourselves and

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,899
I'm this is asking me anything I figured

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:34,260
I'd see it with a question for our

00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,029
fearless leader what is the rule because

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,040
we always debate this in our club if you

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,020
had we have just been here for a solid

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,910
week in bootcamp getting training

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,680
figuring out our planning for the next

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,920
year so we've been drinking a lot of

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,750
really good beer here in Bruno but we

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,940
all have different things about what the

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,800
role is but we should hear from ya so

00:12:50,940 --> 00:13:03,959
for me the role is to get developers

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:06,810
about new technology or not marketing

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,570
we're actually there to help developers

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,150
do something right and so in order to do

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,279
that we actually have to know how to do

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,770
it ourselves so a lot of people think of

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,040
developer evangelist is kind of just

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:27,519
talking

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:29,740
I made a video about this it's called

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:35,310
the feeding of and husbandry of

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:42,519
developer evangelist you search on this

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:43,930
don't do it now please and you look on

00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,449
youtube that'll be the video where I

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,430
gave my whole entire opinion maybe my

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:51,069
basic opinion about what we are our role

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,870
is to be a bridge right we're not any

00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:55,389
one thing and yet we're pieces of a lot

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,980
of things so we are part marking this is

00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:58,899
where I do disagree with grand we are

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,550
part marketing but we get up and give

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,410
talks and they don't necessarily

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,910
sometimes I go to conferences and I'm

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,100
giving a talk that is almost purely a

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,870
marketing it's not going to be it still

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,670
has to have information in it but it's

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,100
not necessarily like when Graham gives a

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,660
talk on python graham sometimes goes so

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,490
incredibly deep that i could never go

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,319
but i am talking to the marketing

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,690
department talking about what swag works

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:23,620
right you know whatever know what schwag

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:25,690
is right that swag right the scarves are

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,639
swag and so sometimes when you see it

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,500
shows you can tell when there's a market

00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,209
developer marketing versus non developer

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,769
marketing how many of you like this try

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:37,540
to think of what's non developer market

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:39,100
each way no I like the popping up works

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,620
as they're actually oh like a squeezy

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,029
toys you know those how many of you

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,120
picked it up and then almost never use

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,370
them right looks like that that's to me

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,279
is a waste but if you get I wanted to

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,230
get nerf guns right that's good

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,079
developer Martin honks marina so we're

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,399
also sales but not really sale so we

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,529
need to talk to the sales we're also

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,889
engineering but not really engineering

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:07,930
so openshift engineers raise your hand

00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:10,079
the 23 yeah what am I really good at you

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,540
can say it be honest complaining

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,009
bitching so that is my there's a lot of

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,839
times we're called advocates and not

00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,880
evangelist and the reason why is because

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,649
we go to shows these guys sit at their

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,360
desk all the time and just code we

00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,980
actually going to show try to get

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,660
developers to use the product we watch

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,370
them fail and then we come back and

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,410
complain at these people the whole time

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,300
this is

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,470
how can we release it like this we

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,600
should not that open ship has any flaw

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,160
it's perfect it's perfect because of the

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,740
complaining we did very really on in the

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,089
process and then we also meet with PMS

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,529
as well so Mike what else am I really

00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:48,269
good at yeah our job is with the PM's is

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,120
to say your roadmap sucks this isn't

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:53,009
helping my users I we're developers so

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
we about what developers need and

00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:56,610
someone wants to about what does

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,740
it mean needs or Enterprise Custer or

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,540
enterprises it means need I don't care

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,899
someone else could do that I'm on behalf

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:10,199
of my users I'm advocating back into the

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:12,930
company openshift being a platform as a

00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:15,300
service touches on a whole lot swath of

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,410
communities and so while we're

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,689
presenting and trying to connect

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,639
developers to open shift and get them

00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:22,889
all excited about this and get that

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,439
feedback we're also touching on Cooper

00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:28,170
Teddy's docker OpenStack so you'll see

00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:30,899
us show up at OpenStack summit or Kubek

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,089
on and other places where we do long

00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,519
work with MongoDB on three so there

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:38,160
we're all over the map so we're not

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,740
necessarily experts on any one thing

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,470
we're a lot of us are spread a little

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,149
thin sometimes I think it would it's the

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,279
feedback loop that's really important

00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,319
that we play to the PM's and the

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,360
engineering teams but it's also all that

00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:53,310
cross community collaboration so when

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,889
openstax about you do something new with

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,720
Neutron you know we get heads up or we

00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,589
try

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,240
I don't cry to demo I hate that stuff

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,309
but Ryan like the things that we're

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,720
saying here just as you're clear this is

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:07,909
not particularly the open shift team

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,079
this is what it means to be a developer

00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,130
revenge so how many do you like to sit

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,289
with your head down all the time and

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,569
write code all day okay you are not

00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:16,250
going to become a developer event you

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,659
can't do that you can be good at that

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,589
but you can't do that like ryan when you

00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,059
were to vent bright if you were doing

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,490
some of the same tasks right that we do

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,799
now yeah yeah definitely getting

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,210
feedback i was actually within that

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,169
company part of the marketing team but

00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,960
organizationally i was a part of the

00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:35,120
marketing team for a while because they

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,750
didn't have anywhere else to stick me

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,390
within the company they also i moved

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,669
over to the product management team for

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,480
a while so depending on how your company

00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:50,840
is structured you make it but within one

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,799
of these other camps right but it still

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,809
should be your duty to advocate for the

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,080
needs of the developers the needs of the

00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,450
users and give that feedback back to the

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,100
product team so I think we didn't

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,830
actually answer the question though what

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,840
we do so so what do we do we give

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,909
conference talks we write sample

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,610
applications we write reference

00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:16,429
applications for the product we give

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,950
trainings workshops write blog posts we

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,230
have to have an active Twitter following

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,750
we have to be influential in some type

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,480
of community like Steve is pretty well

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,770
known in the geospatial I'm very well

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,810
known in Bobo grampa etc and so we kinda

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:36,150
have to be respected in the community

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,860
that we're targeting right so like if

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,890
you asked me to go and talk about nodejs

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,410
I wouldn't go right I would have run so

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,760
we build teams around different interest

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,550
areas but that's mainly what we do

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,830
Congress talks blog post stuff like that

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,780
and use the product actually you'd have

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,730
to be deep in usually you have to be

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,890
deep in two technologies what is the one

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,660
that you have like open G one is the

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,060
other one would community work with and

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,520
then you have to be spread on so many

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,680
technologies being see what's happening

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,960
in five delivering their he wasn't in

00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,150
there all the emerging technologies have

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,600
to work out into the future but to the

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:16,080
technology's always at least you should

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:21,210
be too certain level like I can I go

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:24,900
yeah because you're going to have to

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:27,480
just stand for also one important thing

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,100
is that we we socialize alone we need to

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,230
sit and listen to the people to the

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,930
community that we so we like to hang

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,070
around with I could go for beers with

00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,560
the developers because at the end

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:40,410
developers what they do is kind of

00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,260
things not they probably not like to go

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,740
there we are marketing guys to the PM or

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,090
whatever because that that kind of

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,760
engaging with them is really difficult

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:54,060
they are we are really see people to

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,520
treat with sometimes by top if you go

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,040
with still you will get want to go to

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,260
the hotel furniture but you know like

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,150
that prolly with you and you can tell

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:09,900
something on the team longer based on

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:11,370
our side I'm gonna actually disagree

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,300
with more hair just a little bit because

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:17,070
I have to yes that's what I do but to if

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,390
how many of you are actually here

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:23,210
because you're thinking about wanting to

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,210
become a developer evangelist nobody

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:31,680
now now that they understand what's

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:33,210
required like writing code the only

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,590
thing is we're not all extra boost so

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,720
horny makes it sound like we're

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,940
extroverts I'm act and I seem like an

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,620
extrovert right now on stage and maybe

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,240
we're going to talk a lot and I'm very

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,010
outgoing and at the booth I'm very

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,230
outgoing and but when I'm going to go

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,910
home after this week of oh my gosh f is

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,010
we i'm going to sleep for an entire week

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,150
and i won't want to meet people and i

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,440
won't want to do anything i'm just going

00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,500
to go on a walk in the woods with my

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,420
woods with my dog so i turn it on when I

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,460
get on stage it is not that I'm lying

00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,500
right it's not like I turn it on and

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,980
start lying but I turn on the persona

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,930
and then I turn the persona off when I

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,030
actually am by myself and if I keep

00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,580
doing this for tues like this week I've

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,380
done like last night Jorge and Ryan

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,730
wanted to go out drinking and I said no

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,380
and I just went back to my room and just

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,210
watch youtube videos and laughed a lot

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,560
I've got all I could manage at the end

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,570
dude so don't think you have to be an

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:30,450
extrovert to do it and I hate people all

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:39,840
the time hate traveling so I hate people

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:44,250
in a trap and that's actually something

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,540
else we do a lot travel so the one of

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,420
the things that's required with this

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:51,060
position no matter what is traveling you

00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,950
should like at least at some level to

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,950
travel if you're going to do this and

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,750
then depending on the company we travel

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,360
generally less than sale people in

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,130
essays i would say in consultants right

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,260
but we do job we travel way more than

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,120
engineers I wish engineers would travel

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,830
more with us because they're actually

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,390
really good to have in the booth because

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,830
we get lots of deep technical questions

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,180
plus they also get to see direct

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,310
feedback on their product rather than

00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,710
just driven from us but we travel

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,900
anywhere between a quarter to almost a

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,550
half of time but it's not all year long

00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:27,840
its inverse summer look at it my on this

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:30,660
trip was three athletes I worked every

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,430
day for 28

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,350
okay my longest trip is probably about

00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,780
two and a half weeks where I was out of

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:44,530
country the whole time and any trick me

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:51,010
as long as I'm probably week and a half

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:59,560
or so yeah 32 days with one time I met

00:22:51,010 --> 00:23:01,150
my wife airport for lunch flying in I

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:11,950
have four kids all right go so he's

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:14,500
managed to be home a little bit the

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:17,320
acceptable boundaries were very very

00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,270
very em up we go anywhere where you want

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,200
with the questions so I'm one of the

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,690
things we were talking about what

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,340
questions were going to ask and what if

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,930
I don't like public speaking can I be

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:29,860
it'd still be a developer advocate I

00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:37,030
think I think you can unless you have

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:39,670
cojones we are Mexican I one of the

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:42,160
things that are not really from Spain

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:57,130
when I behind the Mexican it is really

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:58,870
ugly American basically I was afraid of

00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,580
public speaking and still am afraid of

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:05,230
public speaking and sometimes you are

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:07,650
speaking to panic your legs shake but

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,660
still that's something that you want to

00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:13,480
overcome or not so you want to do it

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:17,670
it's just a matter of training and 20

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,470
still as you see in there between

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,600
and you more than I was actually a

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,800
professor and a teaching assistant and

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,740
all sorts of stuff beforehand so

00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,290
probably about 1718 years I've been

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,290
public speaking so that one of the

00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:33,210
things Kate we had an ad Miller she's

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,710
now Facebook she would come with me and

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,020
she'd see me speak and it was her first

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,310
year and she's like oh you're so good I

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,440
could never be like you and I was like

00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,570
Katie I could never she was a really

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,100
great at functional languages and it was

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,140
like as if i sat down and started

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,760
writing at what I can't write like handy

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,500
I'm never going to probe them right so

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,790
it's a practice and you just admitted it

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,520
and you'll understand it on and off a

00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:56,250
lot of people when they see us give a

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,260
club like Steve give a talk that is the

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,360
first time he's given that tall and

00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,490
that's not true like we go around the

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,920
user groups and practice our talks then

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,780
we go to larger user grooves and then we

00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,600
submit talks to conferences after we've

00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,460
given it 1015 times right so when you

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,740
see a top that's great at a conference

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,100
it's not the first time they have given

00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,320
that I think that's a big misconception

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,510
for me whenever I go on this page I am

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,950
nervous I go there and then there is no

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,320
time to be nervous you have to do the

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,450
talk then you go out of the stage and

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,930
you like helping good or not and you and

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:36,090
I once again so did it 45 minutes is the

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:39,000
only time that you are both never we

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,220
what we did that one but an hour for

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,580
that America like you needed to talk

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:49,590
instead of me so another thing we talked

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,840
about a lot me about a lot I have

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,120
to say is how much coding do we do and

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,950
what we are always complaining about is

00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,190
we don't have enough time to really do

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,570
coding that's when I'm playing to our

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,280
manager that we should have a month off

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,500
so that we could write more sample apps

00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,159
and things like that and it's probably

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,470
the most

00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,989
part of our job is because we're all

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,739
intact because you love this stuff right

00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:16,349
we want to play with Laird go or no Jas

00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:18,239
they want to build super awesome demos

00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:19,559
but it's really hard to do that when

00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,940
you're in a hotel room at two in the

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,799
morning and you're trying to get your

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,859
slides in or call for papers and or

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,499
answer 20 million email so how much do

00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,210
you did easily Steve don't do enough

00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:32,820
actually that's one of the things that

00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,379
I've so we can all be really honest here

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,080
you want to sell all be really really

00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:40,799
honest here you cuz I don't know yeah

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:45,269
exactly I have no morals so honesty

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:47,340
means nothing so for me though like I

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:50,220
like I actually so I'm in New York Jew

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,749
right and so we are very emotive and we

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,149
like to share and talk amongst each

00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:55,979
other I've noticed that when Jorge and I

00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:57,330
argue which is not even really arguing

00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:59,729
but we're like then how could you even

00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,799
believe that but America's like please

00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:03,299
stop the police are going to come we're

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,999
going to get in trouble you seem like me

00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,619
to each other exactly thought it would

00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,389
be really rude to this mostly check

00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:13,409
audience if I actually engaged in that

00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:16,080
kind of discussion no nobody's gonna die

00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:17,549
though okay so I'd actually gone through

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,710
a period of depression probably for

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,849
about the left for a very long time but

00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,919
for the last three months I've actually

00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:25,739
been pretty depressed we did a very

00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,899
intensive roadshow in the fall and I was

00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:29,700
burnt out after the end of that and I

00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,840
haven't written much code and that's the

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,119
part that's bumming me out the most

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,979
right now because to be an effective

00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,409
developer evangelist you actually have

00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:39,299
to write code because i can't go to

00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,289
developers and be like this is a great

00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,849
experience so this is a terrible

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:44,429
experience or this is what you usually

00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:46,919
do with any authority without actually

00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,359
writing code every once in a while and

00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,369
so when we've been doing a lot of

00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,710
traveling a lot of speaking and not

00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:55,440
having most of you write code is that

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:58,649
right our most of your developers yes

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,059
thank you so you know like you know that

00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,619
you guys talk about interrupting your

00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,049
flow and that's just somebody coming and

00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:07,109
knocking on your cube it's I can't get

00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,940
into a flow state ever basically and so

00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:10,889
it becomes very hard to write code that

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,340
is what I'm struggling with right now is

00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,800
a

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,050
four evangelists is being able to get

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,180
back into a period of time where I can

00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:21,930
be in flow state and write more code and

00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:24,240
I think I think that's part of being an

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:28,070
authentic speaker you need to have

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:31,200
experience and you want to really defend

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:34,800
internally the needs of the developer

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,500
community and if you're not always

00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,200
giving developers good advice and

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,750
reasonable meaningful advice and you

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,910
start selling them a bunch of BS that

00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:48,030
they don't need you'll ruin your

00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:50,330
reputation over time right and so you

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:53,220
really need to have hands on experience

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:55,890
as part of the job I think I'm the only

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,100
one major ahead but I know you actually

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,750
can go because I'm writing that we are

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,240
usually whenever they need something to

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:06,720
their I am forced to do it is also

00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,370
because I can go one could I actually I

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,100
probably have a slightly different view

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,620
to the other song on coding because in

00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,170
my previous job you always flat-out

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:19,260
coding all the time you might work 40 to

00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:22,500
50 hourly and you had to that was your

00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,510
job now I may not code now as much as I

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,850
used to but I'm working on things by

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,710
finding much more enjoyable and that's

00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,050
more important so it doesn't matter to

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,100
me i don't code all the time and not

00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,720
having these breaks and all things

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,460
that's happening good for me because

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,470
most time I want to code on something

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,480
and then I get stuck and I want to think

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,010
about it for a while so this actually

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,470
really good balance you'll be able to

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,600
just knock code so much and have that

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:48,300
break doing I agree with Graham I don't

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,680
get to code a lot i coded last week but

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,630
like he was saying when I code it's on

00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,310
stuff I want to I don't have anyone

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,580
telling me what to do I just get to make

00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:58,290
up something well that's not a bad it

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,150
has to be someone related to what like

00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,410
when when I'm worked when I was working

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,970
it like did I needed to work on a

00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,860
linkedin sample out when I'm working on

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,090
open ships I can't sit there and go i'm

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,580
going to write an app that does nothing

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:18,090
to do with open yet it's got to use open

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:20,100
which is very wrong like your job so I

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,990
think all of us have like little sample

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,029
apps that you keep iterating on and

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,890
playing with and I've got a musical

00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:27,269
jukebox thing with SoundCloud that I've

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,149
been working on and trying to get into

00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:32,250
open shift three and it is it's

00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:33,899
frustrating because you want back in to

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,880
run there and then and then someone

00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:38,429
comes out with another great red hat

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,679
mobile and the feed Henry guys have this

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,029
amazing you know iphone app development

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,130
environment you want to play with that

00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:46,019
too and you get distracted because it's

00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,059
like a kid in the candy box at Red Hat

00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,799
there's just so much stuff and then a

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,990
call for papers come for openstack

00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:54,659
summit no god I gotta try and deploy

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,429
openshift on OpenStack again it's it's

00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:59,970
endless what you get to play with but

00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:06,029
it's endless too so it's a little bit of

00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:07,200
how deep can you go so no one raised

00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:08,639
their hand when they said they wanted to

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,830
be about maybe one person raised their

00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:12,419
hands full yeah one person said the two

00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,970
people maybe what are the rest of you

00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,380
here for I mean I'm serious cuz I want

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,679
to know look we can just sit up here at

00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:26,519
their t-shirts but most of you or what

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:28,740
are you here for okay right that's it

00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,600
this is a big debate in our community

00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,309
about what's the proper term I think

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,539
it's just words we both do the same job

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:42,539
but some people get I know some people

00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:45,690
find it offensive no because I've never

00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,490
seen a company where they have both the

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,899
company usually has developer evangelist

00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,570
so they have developer advocates not

00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,580
both so there's not a dual role it's

00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,799
just how they like Google didn't like

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,049
the evangelical like the Christian

00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,940
implications of evangelists so they went

00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,860
with advocate before that it was always

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,970
developer evangelist but I love telling

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,970
people on the airplane that I'm

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:14,120
especially with you southern accents yes

00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:16,130
I will have four more jack daniels so

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,429
okay so did who here wants to be a

00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:22,010
developer evangelist developer advocate

00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:23,360
few those anymore there's more now more

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,399
it's getting better all right getting

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,450
better so in the news we're hiring in a

00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:30,769
pen yeah there was only 18 pack guy the

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,260
other thing about this well how much

00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:34,789
codeine you do and I think Diane touched

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,409
on this is the one of the things that

00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:39,260
you do need to be as a developer

00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:41,000
advocate / evangelist is curious right

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,649
you are some but I know developers in

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,960
general or like to chase after shiny

00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:46,580
objects but you tend to have more of

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,909
that because you're come a bit more

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,799
comfortable being an inch thick and a

00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:53,779
mile deep and a mile deep on only one or

00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,309
two things right so you have to be

00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,440
comfortable and looking and like what

00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,750
what's the new thing I can play whether

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,519
that's how you learn the new technology

00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,990
well I quit this when I stuff this next

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,399
question but are there any questions in

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,750
the audience is anybody that was really

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,750
10 minutes left ten minutes left

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:22,789
oh it's a lot of that it's a lot of fun

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,679
actually I so I still get to do all the

00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:26,869
developer evangelist do the calls for

00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,299
papers go out there and advocate for

00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:31,879
people to use open shift but i also have

00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,679
a role in in this specific business unit

00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:35,690
of being the person the community

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,669
manager who connects with all the other

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,559
open source projects that we upstream in

00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:41,869
so I get to sit on through benetti's

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,549
management community manager calls I get

00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:45,080
to go to OpenStack and try and connect

00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:47,269
with all the people there of course

00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,359
people into doing heat templates for me

00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:53,269
and I just basically have to do all of

00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:55,129
that plus doing the recruitment and

00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:58,730
trying to get people to contribute code

00:33:55,129 --> 00:34:02,570
that i run the open shift Commons which

00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:06,320
is our community hub so trying to get

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:10,099
organizations and everybody so we have

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,319
now 177 companies in it we have 35

00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,540
companies that have organizations that

00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:16,429
have contributed code to open shift and

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,129
so the commons model is a little

00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:24,379
slightly different so basically I did

00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:27,559
two jobs you need a couple more to stay

00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:29,510
busy I remember the thing I wanted to

00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,609
say and it's related to what grant said

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,200
all the things that we do we all do

00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:35,299
those but we don't all do them all

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,669
equally well so when you went through

00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:40,159
that list don't think like public

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:42,079
speaking Greg hates it and doesn't want

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,940
to do it as much anymore right but he'll

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,260
have to do a little if you can do a

00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,790
mixture of a jerk you'll have to do all

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,549
those tasks you don't have to do them

00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:52,280
all equally well that's all okay jump

00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:54,500
like gram loves writing blog posts thank

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,329
goodness I hate writing so we'll be

00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,349
doing both of those tasks but brambles

00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:00,470
you more writing and i'll do more

00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:02,599
speaking and i'll trade one going to one

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,859
conference for grant writing a blog post

00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,809
so you'll see a swap back and forth

00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:12,809
he'll write that blog post I'll do that

00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:12,809
speaking at that conference to stay home

00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,779
so the way I follow up with the people I

00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:22,089
need as I say you email me otherwise I'm

00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:24,460
never going to be male you it's really

00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:27,130
hard that's the hardest part for me is

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,779
you meet people cuz you're giving talks

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,329
and they come up and talk to you and

00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:32,739
then you see you two years later and

00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:37,509
they come up like you remember

00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:39,420
everything you don't and that that's

00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:41,950
what makes me feel the worst right

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,390
because there's just no way we make

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,529
thousands and thousands of people in

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,599
here and actually have like five

00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:49,029
ten-minute conversations with them but

00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,160
we don't remember where I don't I set

00:35:49,029 --> 00:35:53,440
off by taking cars I don't take them

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,059
anymore and they say oh I'd really like

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,430
to do the look at you to villa okay

00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:59,049
here's my card if you're really

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,489
interested enough you'll contact the

00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:03,670
outside contact me and if they never

00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:06,160
contact me which 99 / seven people never

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,769
do that I'm off the hook yeah I don't

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,749
want that on my soul to have to not

00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:13,359
contact so I have a slightly different

00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:15,369
opinion of that because as the community

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,289
manager I have to try and connect you

00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:19,089
and get you inspired to work on our

00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:21,249
project or work with our project or do

00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:23,410
something with us so i tend to be the

00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:26,049
one that does take your card and you

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,359
will get an email back from me you join

00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:30,489
the commons you can get into our mailing

00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:33,069
list try and force you into giving a

00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:35,650
briefing or becoming what we call before

00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:38,369
an accelerator which is basically an

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,599
external evangelist for open ships so

00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:42,819
there's lots of different ways we all

00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,009
work with the external community but yes

00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:47,109
I probably half of you will come up to

00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:49,180
me in a conference in next time I'm em

00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,650
Bruno and I'm really good at making that

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,190
face

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,810
I think one of the weirdest moments in

00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,480
my life I've been doing this for a year

00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:00,970
and i was at job of one or some

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,160
conference and somebody came up to me it

00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,810
was like finally I finally get to meet

00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,250
you in person I've always wanted to be

00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,620
like what the are you talking about

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:12,070
and I called my wife until about his

00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,660
famous right people read our blog posts

00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:16,320
and stuff and it's kind of a weird

00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,320
feeling

00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:55,540
yeah I do so we are going to talk a lot

00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:59,390
in Asia I do so we let me know yeah yeah

00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:02,330
Asia is where I'm i actually will tend

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:05,930
to speak more like this when I go to

00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:08,450
Asia because their english is not as

00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:11,390
good but it's way better than my ability

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,700
to speak Chinese or Malaysia so I

00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,580
actually I will but it took me years to

00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,440
get that cadence down and I'll do it

00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,600
sometimes you guys all speaking looks

00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,020
relatively well but if I go to another

00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,130
European country when I know it's mostly

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,310
non-english speakers I'll slow down as

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,290
well it also helps to teach kids right

00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,300
like I do i do coding events with kids

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,340
on the weekends too and there you also

00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,170
learn to change your cadence you just

00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,240
have to get its practice the same way

00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,190
like oh I'm in a functional language now

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,510
I'm in sequel I'm in a procedural

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,820
language right you need different

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,500
mindsets the same skill just like that

00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,900
by the product that's sometimes you

00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,780
don't know you go the first time to

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,090
somewhere but you don't know what what's

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,760
their happy so I've been for example in

00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,280
a company in the country what I didn't

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:04,670
know that they have like these sense of

00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:07,010
privacy the top with the guys are going

00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,330
out having some beers and I do it but I

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:14,170
try for the perfect weekend doing

00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:14,170
somebody told me his private space

00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,329
the way we're measured now is based on

00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:50,089
the amount of content that we create and

00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:52,459
the survey forms that you guys fill out

00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:54,619
at conferences to let us know if the

00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:57,079
talk is good because they have a good

00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:59,329
conference it's not just the technical

00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:02,419
information but people want to be

00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:04,489
entertained right even at a conference

00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:06,199
like they like talks that entertain them

00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:08,119
because they don't remember anything you

00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,529
say except for one or two things but

00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:12,019
they'll remember that it was good talk

00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:15,079
on that guy worked it right as you check

00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:18,199
it out so before we found and I want

00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:26,329
Lucy to stand up Lucy is our HR hiring

00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:30,849
person here so you can check in the dark

00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:30,849
he's our that will leave some cards

00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:47,509
there's also a dev evangelist manifesto

00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:49,009
that we wrote we actually came out of

00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:51,619
our document as a team that I've been

00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:53,329
put up in a get to get nasty doc up in

00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:55,579
not forget is it an archaic repo or my

00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:57,980
github repo it's a manifesto that talks

00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:59,450
through a lot of the things we did like

00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,829
this was not enough time to talk through

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,329
a lot of stuff like what's a good

00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:04,789
company to work for but a good interview

00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:06,619
question what's your role what should

00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:08,779
you expect what should you be expecting

00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:10,970
to produce we didn't talk we just barely

00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:13,670
touch the surface of being active it's a

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:15,289
relatively new field too and so you get

00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,999
into a lot of confusions and a lot of

00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:20,109
different companies about what's a good

00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:24,170
developer evangelist what's their role

00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:26,239
yeah that's also a big benefit right

00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,609
because a lot of companies are starting

00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,279
to hire this position which makes it a

00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:34,099
very sought-after position but we

00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:40,069
honestly get job offers at least once a

00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:41,809
week that's a bad news fri yeah actually

00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:43,910
but we live in North America so that I

00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:45,980
mean I and I'm in the Bay Area the rocks

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,269
are probably Brian and I myself probably

00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,599
get the most as we ready they're like

00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:56,960
every startup now vancouver bc it's like

00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:58,309
you know linkedin that hey I'm sorry you

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,739
won't get paid as much as an engineer

00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:03,109
maybe certainly in the beginning if

00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:04,489
you're worried about compensation in the

00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,670
beginning depending on the company they

00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:08,749
will not see you as valuable as ninja

00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,670
those are some of the things you need to

00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:12,349
suss out and figure out when you're

00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,119
interviewing two is to really ask them

00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:16,099
I'm out of time is there any sessions

00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,569
after there's no sessions after answers

00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:19,569
is one upstairs for the prize

00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:28,749

00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:58,100
