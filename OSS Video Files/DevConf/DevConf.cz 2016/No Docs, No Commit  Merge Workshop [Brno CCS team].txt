Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	When development and documentation efforts are coordinated, customer satisfaction is more likely.

This theatrical skit presents both failure and success scenarios (in that order) using an extended medieval metaphor. After the skit, we explain things briefly, comparing "no docs, no commit/merge" to "no test, no commit".
