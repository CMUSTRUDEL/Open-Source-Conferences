Description: 
	Keeping secrets is tough. It is hard enough when you have control over the full computing chain. But now we are expected to keep secrets while storing those secrets in cloud and SaaS infrastructures. At least we can trust the network providers, right? Of course, the answer is to encrypt the data. But then how do we know who should have access to the data and when?

This talk will look at the new cryptographic techniques implemented by the Deo open source project. It forgoes complex (and compromise-prone) key management infrastructures by using simple algorithms to bind data to third party entities. Come see how to integrate Deo into your infrastructure or software project!
