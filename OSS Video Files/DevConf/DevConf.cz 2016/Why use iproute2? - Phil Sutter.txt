Title: Why use iproute2? - Phil Sutter
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	This will be a tour of iproute2 features, showing which dedicated tools it supersedes, why it is superior to them and what additional functionality it provides.

I intend to show most of the presented things live in order to better illustrate how working with the 'ip' command looks and feels like.

The project home page is available at: http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collab...

Motivation behind this talk is my impression that many users still adhere to traditional tools like 'ifconfig', 'route' or 'netstat' and therefore never get familiar enough with iproute2 to intuitively get around with it for use-cases where there's no alternative to it.
