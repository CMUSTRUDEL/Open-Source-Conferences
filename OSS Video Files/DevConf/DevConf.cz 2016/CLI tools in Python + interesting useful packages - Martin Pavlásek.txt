Description: 
	You can take advantages of Python even you don't know the language!

One part of this session would be focused on useful python modules, that can be used as command line tools in your scripts - knowledge of python is not required.

By the rest of time I would like to show you subset of interesting python packages available on PyPi and how these tools can you help to avoid reinventing wheel. Ready for action? :-)

You can looking forward to a lot of demos.
