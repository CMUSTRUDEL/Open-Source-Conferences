Description: 
	Test your favorite OS or application in OpenQA!

OpenQA is automated testing framework backing openSUSE and SUSE distributions.
But by nature it is universal testing tool, just bring installation iso of your favorite OS and lets start.
I will cover basic openQA work and you will be able to write test for almost anything you want.

I will provide VM's with preinstalled openQA admin node and worker node, attendants will need own computer capable of KVM virtualization.
