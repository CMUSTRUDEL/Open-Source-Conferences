Title: User Experience Design and the power of PatternFly - Serena Doyle, Catherine Robson
Publication date: 2016-02-11
Playlist: DevConf.cz 2016
Description: 
	Learn how to adopt user experience design practices and tools into your projects with this practical talk on user experience design, design thinking, and using design patterns through PatternFly (patternfly.org).

The presentation will demonstrate the importance of design in every engineering project, and how you can adopt Bootstrap with PatternFly to take your enterprise applications from good to great with minimal effort.

At the end of the talk attendees will understand what UXD is, how they can apply design thinking principles into their own work, and how they can use PatternFly to more quickly move their project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTrFH... good design principles.

from there we move into the design phase

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,940
and in design this is where you really

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,440
start to get the creative power of

00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,570
thinking about how we can solve the

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,610
users problems and there might be many

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,730
ways to do that so coming up with ideas

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,590
around how we solve the users problem in

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,010
different ways and getting to that ideal

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,109
design at the end of the day and we'll

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,449
talk here about idea generation and how

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,769
you do idea generation as well as the

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,200
tool of wire framing also then you move

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,750
into prototyping and we'll talk about

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,120
different levels of prototypes and the

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,890
value of starting small and growing

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,070
momentum as you iterate through this

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,480
process and then testing getting

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,190
incremental tests as you move along not

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,329
just testing once you've built the whole

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,879
thing and so how do you test internally

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,489
and then with users as well so that you

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,660
can validate that your product or your

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,640
design ideas are working and of course

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,830
this is an iterative process and we will

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,110
address how you start at the beginning

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,150
and then how you can kind of grow and

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:20,430
refine as you move along the iterations

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:23,340
so starting off with concept this is a

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,229
part of the process where once again

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,049
you're really trying to define what is

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,030
the purpose of the product that I'm

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,430
building so everybody on the team

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,310
doesn't understand some of the basic

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,650
questions about what value is it's going

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,140
to bring to our users

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,390
how will their life be improved how is

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,340
this different from other solutions out

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,780
there on the market it's very likely

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,070
that you're going to create a product or

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,479
a solution at the end of the day that

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,090
isn't really that compelling to the

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,119
market so taking the time to really

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,290
understand why you're building what

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,149
you're building and making sure the

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,820
whole team understands not just the

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,409
product owner can really make sure that

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,460
everybody's driving towards that same

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:09,500
vision the next step of this is

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,080
understanding who your users are so

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,600
in user experience design we do a lot of

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,480
user research we'll go out and actually

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,600
sit next to users watching them use what

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,210
they they do today kind of identifying

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,390
trouble points seeing them in their

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,800
context so you start to see things like

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,870
okay you know this user is using my

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,610
product while also answering the phone

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,740
and getting interrupted by five people

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,470
and whatever else is going on within

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,150
their context and so really doing

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,610
research understanding who your users

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,730
are their environment and their needs

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,290
can help drive design decisions that you

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,260
make later on so for that very

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,300
interrupted user you might need to

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,310
design the system in a way that they can

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,290
leave their tasks in the middle of a

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,630
task come back and still have a clear

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,760
status of what's going on because

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:03,020
they've completely forgotten where they

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,580
are in the steps and so in user

00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,920
experience design we call this process

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,170
user research and then out of user

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,760
research we typically create something

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,209
called personas and personas are

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,430
exemplar users these are something that

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,820
the the development and design teams can

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:27,650
use together to discuss our users in a

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:32,720
common format so also part moving into

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:35,690
the definition phase we really encourage

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,390
all teams to use user stories this is

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,830
very common in agile development and so

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,239
most people who are doing agile

00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,610
development are very familiar with this

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,310
format but even if you aren't using

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,080
agile development the use of user

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,940
stories can be very helpful so that you

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,870
start to think about your requirements

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,810
in users terms so why does the user

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,239
actually want this feature what's the

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,430
reason behind it and which user wants

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,440
this feature maybe all of your user

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,570
types need this feature maybe only one

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,940
of them do but having that discussion

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,230
and truly understanding how it's going

00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,269
to be used at the end of the day can

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,890
really help drive the design and what

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:19,250
you implement and you know I caution you

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,080
here because so many teams rush through

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,389
the step you want to start building and

00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,879
I get it you know we're all

00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,129
we want to build it but if you don't

00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,780
spend the time really forcing the teams

00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:32,719
to get to the level of detail that's

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,240
needed here it means that you're not all

00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,279
on the same page and you're gonna kind

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,189
of end up with a disparate

00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:44,810
implementation also in the definition

00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:48,169
phase another tool that we use in user

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,909
experience design is user flows and once

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:53,650
again this is the step that a lot of

00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:56,840
people skip past and go right to design

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,000
but the value here is that by really

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,889
thinking about your user flows

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,599
you're gonna start identifying some of

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,879
those areas where you might have touch

00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:07,990
points between systems either internally

00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,639
between your team or possibly even

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,979
externally between other teams other

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,229
systems websites that pass off to you

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,330
could be a variety of things and it

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:19,870
really helps you understand the full

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,400
path that the user is going to take and

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,979
communicate with other teams potentially

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,860
about what what you need from them and

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,960
what they need from you in a more

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,069
consistent fashion and that at the end

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:39,169
of the day is going to produce a better

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:42,169
experience for your users moving into

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,659
the design phase this is the fun part

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:48,589
from my perspective right this is what

00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:50,629
what we love doing as designers but this

00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:53,719
is where where you start off with

00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:55,580
divergent thinking you really how can we

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,580
create something that is different that

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,889
it's unique that is maybe outside of the

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,589
box what is something that we could

00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:09,020
actually maybe use even as a competitive

00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:12,169
you know improvement upon what's in the

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,699
industry so far so really think outside

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:16,419
of the box here come up with lots of

00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:18,680
different designs get other people

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,210
adding in their designs if you're

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,639
creating something just for your team

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,259
maybe get other team members who aren't

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,810
thinking about it also creating some

00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,129
designs because through the divergent

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,319
process that's where you're really going

00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:33,139
to get some new ideas and change the way

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,789
that you think about the problem but

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,589
this has to be time bound we can't just

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,009
go create you know all these different

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,020
option

00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:41,869
forever at some point we have to decide

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,400
on something and move forward so it

00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,710
needs to be time bound and at some point

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,110
you're going to start converging on a

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,699
couple of ideas and it doesn't mean that

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,399
some of the ideas that you're not

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,559
converging on are not good and you might

00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,779
come back to those in the long run but

00:06:54,559 --> 00:07:01,009
you want to choose a few ideas that you

00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:03,619
think are useful and might really be

00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,869
something that you can implement and get

00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:12,469
good user feedback on and start moving

00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:13,819
towards implementation of those so a

00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:17,960
tool that we use in the design process

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:20,870
is called a wireframe wireframes come in

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,909
a lot of Fidelity's so they can be very

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,009
low fidelity they can even be you know

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:29,629
sketches on paper sketches on napkin who

00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:31,550
cares or they can go all the way up to

00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,199
being extremely high fidelity where it's

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,779
actually a name it you know pixel

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
perfect sort of image of what the system

00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,289
is going to look like when it's

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,110
implemented we highly encourage you to

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,270
start very low fidelity at the beginning

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,990
and only work towards higher fidelity as

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,360
you're moving along those iterations and

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,559
by starting with the low fidelity what

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,180
it means is that you're getting the

00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,800
basics you're getting your basic ideas

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,919
out there without getting caught up on

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,809
the details and you can start testing

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,759
those basic ideas and validating them

00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,759
before you commit too much time into it

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,530
so then you start moving into the

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,970
prototyping phase once again you want to

00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,930
you want to take this in an iterative

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:20,229
manner how can you really start thinking

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,900
about implementing this in the minimal

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,000
way possible and that actually might

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,400
mean no code to start with and actually

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,530
I encourage it to mean no code start

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,200
with a best practice is actually to

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,500
create something that you can put

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:40,570
together in a day or less with no code

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,640
to test with users first so here's an

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,790
example that we did actually with the UX

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,730
team we tested a the Red Hat storage

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,220
dashboard at the Red Hat summit in

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,570
Boston last year so we had gone through

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,700
design iterations of the individual

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,079
graphs and metrics that you see here so

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,190
we were fairly confident about those

00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:02,079
which is why they're pretty high

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,540
fidelity we had already iterated and got

00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,700
user feedback on the graphs themselves

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,620
what we weren't confident about is how

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,070
storage users one of these assembled

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,110
onto their dashboard in a way that was

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:17,500
most compelling to them as users of the

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,949
storage product so we printed these all

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,630
out and we allowed users to come up and

00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:24,760
actually to start moving them around and

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,350
talking to us about him and so this was

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,060
no code it was very simple to put

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,680
together and we got a lot of very

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,170
interactive good feedback from users

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:38,410
that really impacted our design at the

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:40,620
end of the day sorry

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:46,029
that's been crackling the whole time huh

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:48,820
all right as you go through the

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:51,490
iterations once again you know you'll

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,920
start increasing the fidelity increasing

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,350
the code and working towards full UI

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,820
development and sarena we'll be talking

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,730
to you a lot more about this phase so

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:06,670
I'm going to continue on and then

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,260
testing this is this is the bread and

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,730
butter right here the more testing you

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,829
can do the more feedback that you can

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:16,149
get from users the better off you're

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:18,250
going to be so there's two levels of

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,960
testing that I wanted to point out one

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,480
level of testing is internal

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,600
it's really just saying alright we built

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,610
something did it meet the criteria that

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
we set out at the beginning does it

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,870
actually meet that user story doesn't

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,610
meet the user flow we defined so make

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,620
sure that you actually implemented what

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,770
you talked about at the very beginning

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,200
so that's step one but as you can see

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,910
here a lot of times this actually falls

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,890
apart especially in those handoffs

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:49,480
between different systems or different

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,120
teams and so it's really important to

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,340
make sure that we we do end-to-end test

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,210
this make sure it meets the users flows

00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,920
as we expect it to meet them if you get

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,980
that basic check then you can move on to

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:07,120
usability testing with usability testing

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,850
there's once again a variety of ways of

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,610
doing this you can do it from you know

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,830
taking your design down to the cube of

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,230
somebody down the hall and just getting

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,990
feedback that way or you can go for

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:24,210
full-out usability testing that user

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:28,750
experience professionals do okay and

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:30,550
that's where we you know we'll do the

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,770
full out way of doing it is we have

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,810
actual usability lab we bring in users

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,300
we watch what they're doing we record

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:41,860
what they're doing there's it's quite

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,450
timely what we do most often in the uxd

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,480
team these days is actually remote

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,420
usability testing and this allows us

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,060
access to a very wide audience which is

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,550
great and you can do this as well with

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:59,380
your systems on your own so you just set

00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:02,290
up a WebEx or webinar type set up you

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:05,200
share your design you hand the mouse

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,450
access over to your user you give them a

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,800
few tasks to try out and see what

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,800
happens see how well they do

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,570
you know okay

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,490
you guys hear me okay okay great so how

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,500
does you excels so I guess the first

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,209
thing that I want to make sure everybody

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,130
understands is UX and UI are two

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,620
different things right so UX is a user

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,930
experience so what does the user how do

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,209
they feel how do they encounter the the

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:41,080
UI as they go through where the UI is

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:42,820
actually the product itself UX is a

00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,740
number of different disciplines it

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,959
includes you know content strategy

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,930
information architecture use a research

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,020
interaction design visual design and

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,940
usability and then if we wanted to break

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,850
down interaction design a little bit

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,290
more the pieces that we focus on a lot

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,779
especially within pattern fly are

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,670
consistency giving relevant instructions

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,200
to what you're doing

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,810
making sure the visuals are appealing

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,610
and make sense you know color is used in

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,760
there the right circumstance at the

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,709
right time and also another one that's

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,209
big is customization options right so

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:19,209
users always like to customize their own

00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:21,550
environment mmm but where does pattern

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,230
fly focus for the most part we focus on

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,510
visual design interaction design and

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,250
user research so I'm going to go through

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,620
that a little bit but before I do I'm

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,810
just curious if you guys but can show

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:37,260
your hands how many of you know have

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:40,180
heard about pattern fly before Wow okay

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:46,480
how many of you guys are interaction

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:49,660
designers okay and developers I'm

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,050
assuming the rest okay all right okay

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,600
excellent so you know how do we go from

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,980
either and an existing product that

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,079
might not look so current or from the

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,149
low fidelity wireframe to something more

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,980
that's like on the right hand side and

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,930
we're promoting that you do that with

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,730
pattern fly so pattern fly is an open

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,079
source project we started it in the Red

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:17,770
Hat uxd team probably in about 2013 but

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,329
in 2014 was the first time that we put

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:23,260
something in github that was accessible

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:24,940
fire from everybody it promotes design

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,339
commonality and an improved user

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,740
experience across and enterprise IT

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:33,610
products our color scheme is

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,400
mentally tested and built for that and

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,720
as well as a lot of the newer components

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,600
that we're putting inside of our pattern

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,310
library lately and if a few guys are

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,750
familiar with it you'll see in the last

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,580
three to six months we've been adding a

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,440
lot of dashboard components etc and

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,220
that's going to be continuing in the

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,230
future currently we use it at Red Hat to

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:58,840
unify the styling and behavior of all of

00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:00,100
our products wwp ry org is our URL I'm

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,890
gonna actually show you that a little

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,560
bit later on but first one to just talk

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,750
about the goal of pattern fly again

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,030
promotes consistency and usability it

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,800
reduces cost in time to market and the

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,780
reason we say this is because there is

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,960
you know proven design patterns in there

00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,970
some of them more complex than others

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,340
and oftentimes many of them are also

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,960
usability tested so from a interaction

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,880
design perspective you can go find

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,920
something there it will explain why to

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,200
use it when to use it but then you'll

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,940
also have for a coder you can go and

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,560
find the reference markup and pull that

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,960
right into your application if you'd

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,510
like to put one of those design patterns

00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,610
into your app it improves consistency

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,750
within your own application if you're

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:46,560
using the same component also for if

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,150
you're using pattern fly within a

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,550
portfolio of products obviously it will

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:54,910
also improve consistency and it

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,730
increases usability it also allows the

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:03,310
user the learn ability is much quicker

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:05,350
because it's consistent so as I

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,180
mentioned earlier or ask a question

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,220
about designers versus developers the

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,310
reason I asked is because we have two

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,990
distinct areas one we have a pattern

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,930
library with usage guidelines like I

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,200
mentioned we also have you know color

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,570
palettes a set of icons we we include

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,310
font awesome icons but we also have some

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,920
custom icons that are just for pattern

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,890
play also talk about typography and

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,540
we're to use what Styles when we ask

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,740
look you've some guidance on terminology

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,720
in wording as far as you know what cut

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,400
what sense and if you should use

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,780
sentence style capitalization or that

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,670
type of thing in different areas of the

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,500
UI

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,760
and then as I mentioned for developers

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,220
there's reference mark up and the

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,410
angularjs directives so we have two

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,420
flavors of pattern fly we have a base

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,490
pattern fly which we're going to talk

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,110
more extensively about but then we also

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:02,310
have an angular version which is a

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:04,660
different flavor excuse me

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:08,170
so what is base pattern fly and what

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,790
does it include it's essentially built

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,079
on top of bootstrap and how many I'm

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,530
assuming how many of you guys know

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,900
bootstrap okay great

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,820
we say it's pattern flies bootstrap plus

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,959
extra love the extra love is supposed to

00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,940
be you know UX involvement usability

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,940
testing as well as we have some

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:31,120
additional components so we've got a

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:34,500
number of bootstrap extras that have

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,180
been put on as well as some jQuery

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,400
components we also as I mentioned

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,160
included font awesome and then we also

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,170
have lately included c3 and d3 charts I

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,140
think we did that in the fall of 2015

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:53,200
and those all have you know a pattern

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:56,500
fly styling built on top of them as I

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,990
mentioned we also have the angularjs and

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,790
there's a different repo for that

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,960
angularjs was actually created as a

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:07,180
grassroots effort within another area of

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,440
Red Hat and then in the last six months

00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:15,550
our group has started to increase

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,860
contributions to that as well if

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,300
anybody's interested on the design

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,340
architect of pattern fly and when

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,100
there's a Leslie Hinson who's also at

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,290
Red Hat's product owner where are the

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,390
ones who do you know requirements

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,640
gathering dated Leslie does day-to-day

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,280
management and to talk about the process

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,650
a little bit as we are using JIRA our

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,030
board is you know completely public

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,490
anybody can go over there and see what

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,890
we've got in the pipeline

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,140
we have two-week sprints so we are

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:48,370
currently publishing every two weeks a

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,860
new release and our stories are very you

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,840
know they're based on coming up with

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,620
conceptual designs first we blog about

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,170
what we're talking about

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:01,010
building we look for the community to

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:03,110
give us feedback then we create a design

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,820
and we have the usage guidelines posted

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,290
on the site then the next sprint we

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,300
create Marfan's markup and then

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,850
typically the next sprint is angular so

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,760
you know we're kind of in the same kind

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:21,500
of cadence as far as getting things out

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:23,120
incrementally so this is pretty much I

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,380
already talked about so yeah for the

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,000
pattern library which I'm gonna show you

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,420
a little bit show I'll show you exactly

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,790
where these things exist on the site I

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:34,160
just wanted to show you a couple of the

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:36,880
different components I'd mentioned some

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,970
of the charting components we have so we

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,200
Katherine it actually showed you the

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,660
testing that we had done at the Red Hat

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,170
summit and what we were doing were a lot

00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,280
of our products were using different

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,700
dashboards and we were trying to look

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,620
for common common dashboard cards to use

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,600
within the application so we've come up

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,360
with a couple of them so you know the

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,460
one on the top is just a trend card but

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,590
it has the ability especially in the

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,500
angular implementation has the ability

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,300
to to change some of the location of the

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,470
percentage or if you want to use a an

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,690
actual value of versus percentage the

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,670
one on the lower the lower left is what

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,559
we call aggregate status cards it's

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,360
essentially the ability to give you a

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,020
count of how many objects are inside of

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,690
your environment and then maybe be able

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,570
to show you either errors or object

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,190
status of certain a subset of those and

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,650
then the one on the right we call a

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,990
utilization trend card because it's

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,270
showing you the current utilization the

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,120
bar or the arc is colored based on

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,070
thresholds so hypothetically you would

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,990
set a warning and an error threshold so

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,500
if it's has not met a threshold yet it's

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,570
green

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,460
once it's met a warning threshold it's

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,740
orange and then goes to red if you hit

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,480
the error and then it also has an

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,190
Associated trendline for the like the

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,600
last 30 days or whatever you choose to

00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:01,040
have and one of the other things I just

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
wanted to focus on was the different

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,590
view types so currently we are

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,659
supporting tables we call this a list

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,159
view and then we also have

00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:15,559
views coming up soon so there's there

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,590
some of our various patterns and the

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,909
ListView has been like really it's been

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,919
getting a lot of attention actually in

00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:23,450
the community lady lately asking where

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,679
as our reference markup is just getting

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,690
released this week so alright so I'm

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:35,029
going to give a demo but it's an it's

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:36,409
recorded good then I recorded it yeah we

00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:39,999
had internet challenges but I would have

00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,999
had worse challenges with my Mac so

00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:03,889
alright so this is this is essentially

00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:05,929
what I what I'm doing is using Bower to

00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:11,899
install pattern fly created a new

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:13,039
directory in installs pattern fly and it

00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:16,549
was a little slow because I was doing

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,690
that outside but once it installs

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,419
pattern fly what I'm going to show you

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,330
is just how quickly it it is to actually

00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,859
bring something in and build a quick app

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,389
so I'm just showing you on the left hand

00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:28,220
side there's a directory called our

00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:31,309
components on the right hand side I'm

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:35,690
touching an index dot HTML and I'm using

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:40,399
VI so excuse me for that I bring up the

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:43,940
index dot HTML I go into bower

00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:46,809
components because there is a underneath

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,789
bower components pattern fly there's a

00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:51,859
QuickStart file and inside that

00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:55,009
QuickStart file it tells you what you

00:22:51,859 --> 00:23:00,940
need to include into your HTML to just

00:22:55,009 --> 00:23:00,940
in so that you can use pattern fly and

00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,940
there you go now I'm pulling everything

00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:13,309
in just because I didn't have time to

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,529
pull out what I didn't need but I'm just

00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,879
pulling everything in and then what I'm

00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,359
gonna do is bring up the pattern fly

00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:19,359
website

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,880
and when to go into pattern fly website

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,010
you can go into the pattern library and

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,990
within a lot of the elements in the

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,440
pattern library there's something that's

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,880
called reference markup or reference

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,570
implementation every forget what we call

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,160
it right now

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,560
yeah reference markup you can open that

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,150
up you have the Associated code so what

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:50,970
I'm gonna do is bring in those aggregate

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:52,920
status cards right into my HTML and then

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:58,500
I'm gonna bring up the browser bring up

00:23:52,920 --> 00:24:00,950
that index dot HTML in there how I typed

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,950
in one line

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:15,010
and then save it and then bring it up on

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:21,370
their left and you can see how quick it

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:23,380
is to bring something in so there we go

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,240
there's the aggregate status cards so

00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,010
then I decided to go back over and

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,550
pattern fly look at the utilization

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:35,100
trend cards where there's a row or a

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,100
strip of three of them you'll see below

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,580
actually that's the one so I choose to

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:47,730
go down to the three and I pull out that

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,730
reference markup copy it again

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:07,930
takes leave so and once we copy it

00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,910
you'll see the result so again like this

00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:13,720
this is great for two reasons in my

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:14,890
opinion and one is you know for the code

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,170
it's great but it's also good for

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,730
prototyping right so you can say take

00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:21,190
something that you see that exists

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,630
inside of pattern fly and build

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,130
something really quickly that might not

00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,660
have the back end working but you can

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,750
actually visually see it and see what it

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:31,210
looks like and even get some interaction

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,300
with it so that's actually the end I was

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:40,450
gonna try to do one more thing but I I'm

00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:42,490
not going to do that now what I'm gonna

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,910
do quickly is just show you pattern fly

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,910
itself

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:59,860
and just go through some quick areas

00:25:53,549 --> 00:26:01,720
you've done more right okay so actually

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,029
I'm also going to say this is this is

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,370
the site design that's currently out

00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:09,669
there we're also working on a pretty big

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,080
site redesign that's gonna be much more

00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,370
usable in the future and I think people

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,370
are gonna like it more it's gonna be

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,649
more focused on kind of delivering

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,240
things for the designer designer and

00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:22,059
developers separately we're now right

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,529
now it's a little bit more convoluted so

00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,330
if you go into I'm going to show you the

00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:27,070
widgets area first so in the widgets

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:32,230
area is everything that we have that's

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:34,510
either a bootstrap or jQuery or c3 and

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,010
d3 charts so you can see anything that

00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:41,110
we've done here and have the code

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:43,000
associated with that so so you can get

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,659
the reference markup for forms there and

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,830
in the patterns area this is more of the

00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,840
these are more patterns that we've

00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,110
created and designed specifically for

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,230
specific use cases I would say so we've

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,630
got different types of things for the

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,120
dashboard we also have different types

00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,340
of charts we have something called an

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,510
empty state so if you're you know if you

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,710
have a table that when you start up the

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,600
table of users for instance there are

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,340
none that exists so we have a pattern

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,409
that it would would show that you could

00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,200
use that will say why there's no users

00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:20,019
and maybe allow you to hook up your main

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,260
action to be able to create a user we

00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:26,500
have things like inline notifications

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:28,600
toast notifications all kinds of things

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,679
like this so again with all associated

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,049
reference markup that you can grab and

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,389
then the other thing is we do have the

00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:39,820
angular currently we have our angular

00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,889
documentation that's on a different URL

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:49,889
but there's also sample code for the

00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:49,889
angular there as well thanks

00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:58,720
okay so we do have monthly pattern fly

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,400
meetings so if anybody is interested in

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,930
attending we give a demo of what's

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,010
happened in the last four weeks we talk

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,100
about what's coming up in the next

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,960
prints and people can give requirements

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,680
or even talk about being able to

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,330
contribute we'd love that and that's

00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:37,750
right now is the end of a presentation

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:40,570
wondering if anybody has questions No

00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,140
yeah we don't not at this point I'm

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,630
sorry

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,520
yeah do we have any plans for a

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,620
wireframe tool that with drag-and-drop

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,970
that would be integrated essentially

00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,540
with pattern flies what you're asking

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,700
and no we don't we do have some

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,900
templates for some of our low fidelity

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,700
wireframe tools that we currently use

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,850
it's I think that's an interesting thing

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,500
that say we could we definitely could

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,720
look at doing that it is something that

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,320
we have started building in some

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,030
components for our team internally

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,480
either for low fidelity and for high

00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:18,220
fidelity for Photoshop so I think over

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,930
time we could look at kind of putting

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,160
those out through pattern fly right now

00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,280
they're not I would say they're probably

00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,020
not organized well enough to share but I

00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,610
think we could get there so that's great

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,260
yeah because we've done some with

00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:34,290
balsamic but we don't have anything else

00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,290
with answers at this point either so

00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:32,510
well they're styles that are their

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,070
styles that are in a subdirectory right

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,200
that you're referencing and some through

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,179
some of that code and those are

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,750
automatically updated etc with each

00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:44,630
release if you're - a lot of what

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,549
pattern fly has some of its styling on

00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,740
top of existing bootstrap and jQuery

00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:50,840
components but others are like built-in

00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,880
components that we build in from scratch

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,690
so it depends on which ones you're

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,690
talking about really

00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,900
right well so in angular you would get

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,190
those automatically so we like I said we

00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,260
have two different flavors so in angular

00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:44,160
you'd be using the directive which is

00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,750
all-encompassing but based on what

00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,290
you're picking and based out of fly it

00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,290
might differ

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:32,700
yeah so on the part of the Red Hat that

00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:37,710
I concentrate on a lot we do have a lot

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:42,419
of teams who use Google toolkit and

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:44,700
other other frameworks as well and the

00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,529
short answer is we don't have something

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,129
for installed applications we've

00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:52,799
concentrated on web applications we

00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:56,850
think that's where the most power is in

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,950
the future for applications to live but

00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,519
there are a lot of teams who have taken

00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:06,450
the pattern fly styles and they can take

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:09,029
HTML CSS from those and basically kind

00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,989
of refactor them for google toolkit or

00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:14,669
other frameworks we have not brought

00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:16,109
that work back into pattern fly at this

00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:16,769
point because we haven't done that in a

00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:18,659
standard way

00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:20,009
each of the teams have kind of done that

00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,509
uniquely based on how they've

00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:22,830
implemented it and I think that's one of

00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:25,139
the challenges is there's so many

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:28,169
toolkits out there that it's hard to

00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:30,570
standardize how we would do that and

00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:32,669
that being said though I mean it is open

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,679
source and we you know we had an angular

00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:36,029
version created so if people are

00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,710
interested in the community to

00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:39,480
contribute into something like that you

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,679
know and there's enough interest then

00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,570
we'd be interested in taking

00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,350
contributors contributions like that as

00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:48,090
well so I think we have two minutes left

00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,769
I just want to say that we have a bunch

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,850
of t-shirts and stickers if you guys

00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:53,009
would want to grab them on the way out

00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,399
and I don't know if there's any last

00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,399
question

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:43,230
yeah yeah it's it's easier but it's a

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:45,870
it's different context right I mean this

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,570
is I think based pattern fly is easier

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:51,930
for for many applications to pull in if

00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,660
you're using angular I think you should

00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:59,070
take a look at angular pattern fly

00:34:53,660 --> 00:35:02,270
because it's more componentized all

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,270
right thank you very much

00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:43,079
if you have room on your left or your

00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,729
right please squeeze into the middle of

00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,940
the room so we can pack as many people

00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:52,410
as possible into the room so we don't

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:55,309
want any seats here please make

00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,309
