next talk is about to begin I hope

00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,360
everybody's enjoying themselves just a

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,880
brief reminder there will be a final

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,240
competition grand finale at four thirty

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,520
in the main auditorium there are we have

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,010
some posters up for grabs if anybody's

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,350
interested with this let me pass the

00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,770
floor to Martin Stransky with his talk

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:27,440
on the state of Firefox and recent

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,440
project development without naka Martin

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:37,290
hello I'm glad to be here I'm a keen

00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,650
Starsky and I maintain firefox on fedora

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,530
and I'll so if we have any question

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,110
about firefox on fedora so you can ask

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,260
me also if you have any question and

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:54,420
during my talk you can just dice your

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:57,960
hand and ask me so let's start first I

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,140
will toil I will talk about five Fox in

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,140
fedora and then talk generally about

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:09,679
five Fox at Mozilla what's new and

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:13,380
what's going on and so so let's start

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,670
well firefox on federal the rest send

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:22,140
recent work we do is the gtk3 port as

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:26,280
you may know so we already have firefox

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,550
on gtk3 in fedora but upstream is still

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:36,420
still fixing some problems so apps time

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:41,490
is going to switch to gtk3 at 4046

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,770
version hopefully and because there is

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,680
early wild development of the Judicator

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,740
II there are many changes many new

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,450
features and it's still not not

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:57,260
completely clear also the next next big

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,750
thing is violent which is the new

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:06,780
display server for the start I have some

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:09,300
some demo of gtk3 Wayland and firefox

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,820
the violent is actually new display

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,960
server the firefox loose looks just the

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,370
same on the

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:23,130
Ln like on each service so I have some

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:26,910
something else and this is the bird way

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,820
because gtk3 could have more than just

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:34,830
one back end you can display the gtk3

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:38,640
application to for instance webpage so

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:42,150
which I'm ago going to show you I hope

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,300
so so I just started to the Firefox you

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:49,560
see nothing because it the output goes

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:53,700
to do web page I hope it's going to run

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,940
yeah so so you could see ya so we have

00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:01,370
this is what this this one big Firefox

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,470
and this is Firefox inside it it's just

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:10,760
application well you can see this is

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:15,570
just for comparison this is just edit

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:25,760
well now you see the gtk Therese is

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:25,760
pretty powerful so well liked

00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:40,440
the less so this is generally our work

00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:45,330
of video in fedora and it's kind of

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:49,699
future of the Firefox I hope so so you

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:54,090
know this is just the plain with Paige

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:58,349
well so so this was fedora and I'm going

00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:03,030
to talk about general Mozilla so assume

00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:06,659
i noticed that the that this is not

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:09,599
firefox is not going so well as mozilla

00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:14,729
would like so firefox losing market

00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:18,750
share the firefox OS is not so great as

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:22,919
it was expected and firefox for android

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:28,110
is not also as successful as mozilla

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:34,819
would like so what to do with those

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:38,610
things what improve there is a new new

00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:42,750
initiative II from Mozilla and its name

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,150
is great or dead and it means that every

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,419
feature every part of the five Fox

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:52,110
should be really really wonderful or it

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:55,860
will be removed so just some kind of

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,779
back to the roots just to have some some

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:04,979
early good parts and everything else

00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:07,199
should go away what is great I hope

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,199
guide is going to be the multi-process

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,949
firefox which is the electrolysis

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:20,250
project add-ons user little really likes

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:28,620
add-ons tools for developers privacy

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:31,080
browsing and profiles there's also the

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,940
dead things which are going to be or

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,190
maybe remove this this what is that it's

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,610
this is really a discussion

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,860
there is nothing definitive Mozilla

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,130
doesn't say this is dead and let's

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:50,580
remove it it's more about discussion

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:53,810
they are talking about and try to find

00:06:50,580 --> 00:07:00,750
what usually like and what is

00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:03,870
problematic the panorama tab groups this

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,600
is feature which is really expensive for

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:11,120
development it has box and it's not very

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:15,780
successful the another thing is this

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,680
full full teams it means Firefox is

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:22,940
going to remove or change how how the

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:29,040
Firefox is the user the user interface

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:32,160
how is it managed so this is not going

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,430
to be some some change there also those

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,020
things pockets and hello those two

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:43,740
things are going to just to add ons not

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:47,540
not the main part of Firefox also the

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:53,430
xpcom zool and binary Adams your site

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:55,650
those are going to be removed the great

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,210
for developers and the developer tools

00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:03,720
and 505 back next the next 50 fire back

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:08,460
is going to be based on the developer

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:13,740
tools developer API from Firefox so you

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:19,200
know firefox has its own API for or

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:26,970
interface for the developers tools web

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:29,690
developers for instant here and

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,690
something else

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,300
yeah the bunker now it's it's look

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:50,680
similar like five buck you can inspect

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:53,560
our lands on the website and so so so

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:58,810
far ball fire back is going to extend

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:08,380
this basic tool and and just improve it

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:12,870
and work on top of it well great for

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:19,800
users the new feature Activity Stream

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:23,920
this like active history you can see

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,930
visited pages play movies from the story

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,790
and so this is just a new feature which

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:34,630
is coming the multi-process Firefox

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:36,730
parrot parrot browsing the pirate

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,360
prompting should should block the

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:44,050
tracking tracking elements which is used

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:48,460
for Adams even in the normal normal mode

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:55,300
not only in the private mode and firefox

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:58,380
account this is a new new new very how

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,080
to manage / files I think the plan is to

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,960
just just have the information online

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,500
it's I think it's quite similar to fleet

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,080
commander it's not the same but just

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,900
similar freed commander from fedora just

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:20,070
to have online online online profile and

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,960
save it store it and so does this do

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:26,020
yeah now they're multiprocess Firefox

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:32,080
this is I think the mine mine think in

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:36,910
the future as you can see there are 22

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:40,300
purchases 11 process this is the chrome

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:45,400
process the mine process is rendering

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:51,090
the user interface and draw the page and

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:53,230
there is the child process content which

00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:57,460
compose the web page

00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:01,270
and draw the web page to share shared

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:05,440
memory add-ons are going to run in the

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:10,000
main process and there is inter process

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:14,590
communication between the mine and child

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,750
purposes you know from already dude does

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:21,760
does that and there's squad there is

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,450
slight difference between Firefox and

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,820
home because chrome has for each tab it

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:34,030
has one process but firefox has 11

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:39,850
process for all the tops to eat shoot

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:46,530
safe memory and should be quite more

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,530
efficient I have also demo of that so

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:55,260
there is a nightly build of the Firefox

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:59,200
i have three pages here it's already

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:04,000
multi-process so i will open here the

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:08,790
process manager and there is processed

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,620
name web content and it actually

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:19,360
composed the page so i will kill it and

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:23,350
wow so the content is gone but the

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,010
Firefox itself is still earning so can

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,010
reload it

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:42,150
well assume as my thing as you may think

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:44,700
this is really a big beaker how to say

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:49,710
big change inside fear Firefox so

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:57,890
everything has to be quite quite updated

00:12:49,710 --> 00:13:01,010
so this is also the mannerism why why

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:04,830
there is so big change in the atoms

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:07,230
because the advance has to be already

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,710
updated for the electrolysis project so

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:17,640
Mozilla also does other changes in the

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:21,390
atoms like there is in mozilla interest

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:24,360
the atom signing you know everything

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:30,740
every atoms which official firefox

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:33,720
installs should be sign it by mozilla so

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:39,960
now there is a there is controversy that

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:42,660
fedora doesn't like it mozilla once did

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,720
once it for the official firefox and

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:54,860
mine reason for that is windows because

00:13:45,720 --> 00:14:00,510
on windows user user are affected by

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:06,000
many many malware and some some atoms

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:08,780
which they don't like and also although

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,430
there are new interface web and web

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:15,780
extensions which should be compatible

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:19,650
with blink and chrome i think and move

00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:22,800
is also removing the zool XP come by

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,560
night by night extensions because it's

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,300
really difficult to maintain everything

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,790
for the newer releases if you have new

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,280
releases you have to maintain the old

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,640
whole thing and it is difficult it's

00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:40,079
it's expensive so this is the reason why

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:47,259
those things are going to be removed

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:51,300
well I think this is pretty much

00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:51,300
everything so if we have any question

00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:19,889
moment i will give you the Mike okay so

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:22,000
what are the plans for gssapi

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,439
authentication like improving that

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,540
because there's been some great stuff

00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:27,399
from the free IPA team and the IDM team

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,430
at this conference and they kind of want

00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,889
better support in firefox GSS million

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,300
barrels basically yeah integration with

00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:36,610
kerberos or because we got some really

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,759
cool free IPA stuff for web apps and it

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:45,850
kind of sucks in Firefox oh well well

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:50,319
the cupboard think I actually I don't

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:53,860
know but if it had once it we have to

00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:56,649
just write it and get some nervy Webster

00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,730
so so Jenny I think I think Mozilla is

00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:04,600
not against it but we need to just

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:07,959
implement it so about but there is a

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,009
problem that it doesn't run well in the

00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:15,759
main process so it it has to be in in

00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:19,870
extra thread and this is I guess a bit

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:25,410
complicated but well I think there is no

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:28,990
lo strong movement against it so there

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:36,300
no I think the Messiah just doesn't care

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:36,300
about so yeah yeah yeah we need to do it

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:55,240
yes so so next faction I would like to

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,040
ask about HTML or video hardware

00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,980
acceleration better there is any kind of

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,470
support or addition to improve it

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:08,170
because many sides I'll switch from

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:10,360
flesh to a html5 video but I noticed

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,079
that it increases a lot CP consumption

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:18,449
so there are me well I'm asking about

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:22,180
the you know the product from Cisco or

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:24,550
just just some general collection or you

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,189
know windows linux or it would be

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,050
basically the best way how to make sure

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,050
that when I'm playing videos through

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,360
firefox no there is not so much high cpu

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,940
such as it is today with the current

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,820
standard well it early depends which

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:48,670
platform do target with it because our

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:54,150
middle linux yeah linux well well under

00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:59,290
linux i think the best way is to use the

00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:02,920
adobe plugin but it's disabled so you

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:07,450
know the Google Google plugin google

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:11,800
form at the vp is it's not very

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:15,100
efficient and hardware codecs are but

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:19,660
are not allowed so you don't have good

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:21,790
choice here but that's sorry but i'm not

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,790
really expecting the video video

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:29,530
playback so i don't have really good

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:33,490
good question for you that was a good

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:36,190
answer hi do you have some internet

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,680
information about projects terrible and

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,870
they do you think that it will the

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,880
Firefox will be the internals will be

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:46,750
replaced with project servo or it will

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,149
be the different project whole time yeah

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,659
unfortunately my house tanka

00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:56,739
who is expert on the server he he didn't

00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:59,349
make it here so but the project servo is

00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:02,379
not going to replace the whole Firefox

00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:05,200
but it going to a place only some part

00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:07,979
of the Firefox only small small parts I

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,190
think the first first replacement is

00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:14,919
going to happen soon some subset of the

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:19,210
page composing is going to move to the

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:21,909
servo but it's really only only smart

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,700
part of the Firefox are going to move to

00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:26,379
the thermo so it's going to be in the

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,869
final it's going to be some some

00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:33,599
composition of the old Firefox and old

00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:39,729
code and the new rust rust poverty servo

00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:42,460
yeah actually I tried to prepare some

00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:47,589
some servo some some server browser but

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:49,629
it's crushing on my linux oh so I'm

00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:54,369
sorry but I know that the move of the

00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:56,440
server for you mmm hi so first thing

00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:58,779
first why did you kill Firefox OS

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,200
because I loved it but it's not real

00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:04,629
question the real question is I saw from

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,469
the demo that you made before that if

00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:11,019
you want tab crashes it brings all of

00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:15,519
the crash the tabs down right so is that

00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:17,919
supposed to be improved later and split

00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,469
into different processes or the plan is

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,440
to always have all the tabs being

00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:26,349
handled by single process yeah that is a

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,159
good question and mostly lies there is

00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:32,219
no technical reason to have only one one

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,499
process for hold up actually it's a

00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:38,769
missoula once it because it's simple to

00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:42,070
have just one page and one practice but

00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:45,700
Mozilla wants to have more memory

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:50,529
efficient way to have one purchase for

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:54,159
more tops so if there is aa reason to

00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:56,019
have some tabs in one process and some

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,169
tops in other process then Monsieur

00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:02,489
could do that easily so i think it's

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:02,489
it's possible Murphy

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:21,330
well it's not i canna do panorama tops

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,730
ahead I began you mentioned that

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,460
panorama tops are going to be killed

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,380
because of some issues I never had an

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,540
issue with it and it's a man of the

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:34,920
reasons why I'm preferring Firefox yeah

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:37,050
the panorama tops is from from

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,930
information I have is going to move to

00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:42,030
sub 2 i doona it's not going to be mined

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,810
part of Firefox but it's going to move

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:48,240
to just add on and maintained outside

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:51,480
the browser I'm just curious do you know

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:59,220
about any new in box with this feature

00:21:51,480 --> 00:22:02,040
oh no no no I I I don't know is there

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:06,570
any plan to improve the integration

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:11,970
between a Firefox and plasma 5 you know

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:14,120
you know kitty kitty well I know there

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,950
is no maintainer of that code so you

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,220
know generic Mozilla doesn't care about

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:23,130
linux desktop they don't have money to

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,130
invest it to do it and they don't have

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:30,510
users the Linux is just one percent of

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:34,980
all users so there is no resource so if

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:39,080
you if anyone needs that so he or she

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,080
needs to ready to support for it

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,090
if i remember well you said about a

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,640
Firefox for Android isn't doing very

00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:57,990
well in terms of usage to have any

00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:01,710
numbers for that oh sorry I you have any

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:05,100
usage numbers for firefox on android no

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:08,670
i don't have numbers the problem under

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,730
under under it is that you know the

00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:15,240
firefox is growing on the android but

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,430
not as fast as the whole market so it is

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,100
behind the market and this is the

00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:23,880
problem yeah because it's not growing

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:27,540
faster than other verses there yes it's

00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,210
not it's not general genera file but

00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:45,900
it's a behind the expectation on the

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:47,880
under it okay sir I was just going to

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,740
ask also about no mint aggression

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,290
because positives mentioned before and

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,360
now with the fact that the themes are

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:57,540
getting killed off means we can't even

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,510
have a look that even resembles like a

00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,580
desktop so it's going to look alien

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,670
compared to everything now well actually

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,690
this stop you know the there's a problem

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:20,580
that you know the genome genome team the

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:23,550
plugin mmm well it's elias i think the

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:28,080
grunting one wants this plugin to be

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:31,140
default in fact right well but it's a

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,690
difficult from the maintenance side to

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:38,280
update it for each release to the five I

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,010
know I made the team so yes so easily

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,260
yeah if there is some security update we

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,650
need to leave the Firefox as fast as

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,150
possible and I understand i was just

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,290
talking about the desktop integration of

00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:53,970
the browser it will look and feel alien

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,020
completely now that there's not even a

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:59,440
possibility of like someone adding

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:03,640
you know themselves later on so I guess

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:09,060
there's really mm-hmm oh it was just a

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,060
follow-up point that's all okay sorry

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,340
just because we talked about video

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,020
acceleration I was wondering I know

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,940
there was a bad shot you gingy stream

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,310
are we using gstreamer to do video

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,820
recording on linux well unfortunately

00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:34,600
mr. Murray's going to be removed ill or

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,570
is also removed and ffmpeg is going to

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,010
stead of it okay yeah I think I heard

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,720
about this but yeah it's a bit

00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:44,800
disappointing yeah because there are

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,840
lots of lots of bugs reported about

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,200
gstreamer there are lots of crashes a

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,060
full full Bugsy all right so and we

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,150
don't have resources to maintain the

00:25:52,060 --> 00:26:12,250
gstreamer on the Firefox okay good luck

00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:23,740
with everything good luck with other

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:26,850
framework regarding the firefox on

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:29,560
Android I have a question whether

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,900
anybody is going to improve the memory a

00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,330
consumption on and read because this is

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:39,280
a big minus increase the chrome yeah

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:44,440
well I think it's really early problem

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:49,240
there and Mozilla muscle I strike but I

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:52,840
don't have any news about so so so I

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,170
just don't know dr. it so I know my

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,260
company from the beyond he works on that

00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:03,510
and but I don't have any any numbers but

00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,510
any further info about it

00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:18,190
oh if those are all questions so thank

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,190
you and enjoy the conference

00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,070
