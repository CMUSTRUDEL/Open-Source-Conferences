Title: Misusing Ansible as an Integration Test Framework
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Ansible is best known as a configuration management tool, but our QE team has been misusing it as a lazy man's test framework for nearly 2 years. So why on Earth would you do this?

We'll discuss how we leverage Ansible to perform test verification and some of the hacks we've used in this approach. This talk will highlight how we have been successful testing 10+ concurrent release streams across 3 separate distributions using this method. We'll also cover why this has worked for our use case and why it may not work for you.
