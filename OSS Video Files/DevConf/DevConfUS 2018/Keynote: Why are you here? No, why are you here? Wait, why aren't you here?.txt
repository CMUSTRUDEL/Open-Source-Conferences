Title: Keynote: Why are you here? No, why are you here? Wait, why aren't you here?
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Saron Yitbarek (founder of CodeNewbie) and Chris Wright (Red Hat CTO) will interview each other on a few topics. We will start with why and how they got in to software, why they are still in software, and why they want to stay. Next we will move on to, how to increase inclusion in software. Finally, they will discuss their perceptions of the impact of the tech revolution on the disadvantaged. Oh, but wait, the moderator will step in and ask, so what are *you* doing to make an impact? As time permits, the audience will be solicited for more questions.

we free Mike there we go

00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:57,679
did you guys have fun at the party last

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,880
night was everybody at the party or are

00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:09,440
those people the ones that aren't here

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:11,209
yet so so I hope you had a good time I

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,660
thought it was really fun the pinata was

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:16,370
killer if you stayed that late and that

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,470
was that was pretty cool

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,239
and you know of course Jacob's cloud

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,370
costume so I just wanted to thank say

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,590
thanks to the fun committee for putting

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,720
on the party we'll do some more thanks

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,519
and stuff the closing and moral of the

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,519
story there is if you really want to

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,400
have a great party in IT get the interns

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,760
to plan it exactly works every time

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,760
right so just a reminder that the

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,459
closing does have prizes so you know if

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,609
you want to come by for that there is at

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,470
least a Bluetooth speaker I think most

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,209
of the rest of it is nowhere near as

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,150
cool but you know hey it's what I could

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:55,040
gather so I you know please stay for the

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,220
closing you know please come to all the

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,450
talks today we really like to see you

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,940
and we hope you're having a good

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,560
conference so far definitely let us know

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,540
if you have any feedback good bad or

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,019
indifferent that way we can do a better

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,919
next year

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:13,579
so that's the first part the next part

00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,530
is we did board for lightning talks out

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,569
in the distant lounge and so if we get

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,269
some people who want to do some talks we

00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,799
might have an empty slot again and so

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,829
therefore we can just kind of throw up a

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,049
new talk just for fun the Easter egg

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,450
talk is being reprised and running again

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,590
today

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:35,800
it is hilariously funny I was literally

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,480
crying so I highly recommend trying to

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,940
get to that you just have to figure out

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,070
where it is and when it is in the

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,410
schedule it should be obvious because it

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,160
does not sound like anything else I

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,420
think that's it for the announcements

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,700
but you know we hope you having a great

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:58,780
time and Hugh's gonna do the intros for

00:03:51,700 --> 00:04:01,150
our keynote oh thanks Langdon so I I've

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,030
been working with been working for Chris

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,360
right now for about nine months since I

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:11,830
started here in Boston but I've been

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,880
working with him since 2007 I think that

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,510
sounds about right

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,850
we worked together on on RedHat Zen

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:23,460
which was the virtualization of the

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:26,860
future turned out that was a bad bet but

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,810
we we had a great time I think mostly a

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,630
great time doing it and Chris has been

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,270
not only a force in Red Hat but a force

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,020
in my life and also happens to be about

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,290
the most laid-back person I've ever met

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,820
which is kind of cool

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:50,169
Serrano by contrast I've only known for

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:52,330
about 10 minutes however I know love her

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:57,220
as not only a talented

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:59,800
interviewer and a force for good and

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,650
sanity in this bizarre world that we all

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,390
work in but also is a really interesting

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,800
and engaging speaker so I am really

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,500
looking forward to having both of them

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,980
share their thoughts with us and please

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,029
welcome Sarah and Chris

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,029
[Music]

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,050
how y'all doing today good

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,910
I've never been described as a force

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,520
before I love that put that on my resume

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,110
I thought on my LinkedIn I think you all

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,990
for coming really excited to see you all

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,100
I heard you had a great party last night

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,290
so kudos to you for showing up this

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,680
morning that is awesome go you Chris are

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:44,520
you excited today I am on West Coast

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:49,650
timezone translation never been more

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:53,090
excited actually I haven't been able to

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,560
make it much a deaf Nam translation none

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,280
I'm in the process of moving and moving

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,440
out here to Boston and as exciting as

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,790
that is it's totally diverted my

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,460
attention away from being able to be

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:08,670
here so this is my first experience at

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,400
dev comp us and I hope to make the best

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,500
of it so I think a good place to start

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,060
is to figure out who's in the room so

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,240
we're gonna do a little of audience

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,460
interaction yes yes wait oh yeah yeah

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,060
yeah

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,970
okay okay so show of hands if you are a

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,990
student raising high rates might be

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,750
proud of I like that okay show of hands

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,730
if you consider yourself a open-source

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,350
contributor raising hydrate some high

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,240
raise oh okay

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,740
show of hands if you've contributed in

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,550
the last six months

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:48,170
Oh serious people I'm liking this okay

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,640
glass a month oh my god oh man okay very

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,090
very exciting all right so I think a

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,400
good place to start is you are the CTO

00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:03,950
Red Hat which sounds very important

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:06,350
and you've been your chief theory

00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,960
president and you have been a software

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:14,240
developer for over 20 years how did you

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:18,350
get started my story is probably not

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,860
that unusual I got started as a kid with

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,980
a gift from my grandfather which was a

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Commodore vic-20 I really wanted the 64

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,500
but it was a little out of reach and I

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,670
got excited about programming from that

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,220
machine as a kid also I had an

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,720
opportunity to go to a couple of

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,390
courses that were taught at a local

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,690
university but were aimed at kids just

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:49,140
to learn basic basic programming and I

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:51,660
would say I got a bug there although I

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,150
didn't pursue it directly and it was a

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,710
little indirect it was much later

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,610
through school and I got reconnected

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,830
through University where I got

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:04,080
reconnected with computing and when I

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,720
left school I I studied physics and when

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,770
I left school I thought I have two

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,370
choices I could become a physicist and

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,410
be the person that knows everything

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,640
about the thing that there's only three

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,740
other people on the planet you can talk

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,510
to about it also very impressive which

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,390
would be cool actually I was I was I

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,800
really struggle with this decision or I

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,780
could just do something different and

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,220
something different is what drew me and

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:35,880
then eventually and that was largely

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,010
about UNIX and computers were still

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,660
something that I found a lot of interest

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,090
in and even though the command line is

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:49,640
arguably arcane somehow I found it

00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:53,040
intuitive and so that's what I did I

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,040
launched into computing at a university

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,870
deciding not to be the person that knows

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,480
the thing that only through other people

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,930
on the planet know something about well

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,980
looks like it worked out

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:09,460
I'm not going to sit here and talk to me

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,710
okay so you when you first got a news

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:15,580
decoding did you understand that that

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:18,760
could be a job I had no idea I was 12 so

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:25,030
I was like jobs didn't exist a job to me

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:26,770
a job was I thought maybe you know a

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:32,980
garbage man would be really cool I was

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:36,880
pretty into the trucks and that's

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,490
advanced and then that was when I was

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,690
younger and then by the time I was

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,840
playing with computers I was much more

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:46,120
interested in sports and I thought maybe

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,540
just maybe I'd be a pro sports player I

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,040
wasn't sure exactly how because I wasn't

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,780
good enough at any other sports it just

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,120
seemed like a fun thing to do so you

00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,200
didn't have a sport in mind no I just

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,780
had the concept

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,850
and then so codeine as a career was not

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,040
obvious at all and it wasn't necessarily

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,130
much of a thing that my time it was

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,660
pretty niche still it was in university

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:16,550
where I realized it was enough it was a

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:19,550
thing and I thought what a terrible

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,130
sounding thing to do sit at a desk all

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,260
day long staring at a computer screen

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:30,920
writing lines and lines and lines of

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:34,910
code and then I got into it where did

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,110
the time go well interesting now you you

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,880
travel all the time

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,500
so you don't actually sit at a computer

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,120
all day the way you that's right how do

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,670
we avoid you that's right that's right

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,340
that's more recent so I did spend a lot

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,930
of time in front of the keyboard and the

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,510
thing that I did the thing that I missed

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,360
the most in the beginning was pencil and

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,010
paper because as a physicist you spend a

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,040
lot of time with math and math equations

00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,600
and I loved the process of solving a

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,880
problem and thinking about it but also

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,970
writing it down and it took me about a

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,010
year in my first job to get over not

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,430
just working things out on pencil on

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,640
paper and

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,370
it took me about five years to get over

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,170
not writing things on with a pencil and

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,810
paper so I just write a lot of documents

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,770
twice write it out and then type it in

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,960
and today it's the office that I'm you

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,240
know keyboards are not an extension of

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,830
how I think and so it's yes very

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,500
different I'm a big fan of writing

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,089
things down for me right there's

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,589
something about the process and it

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:37,300
cements the idea in my head in a way

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,380
that's different from typing mmhmm

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,060
absolutely yeah

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,140
okay so what did open-source look like

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,520
20 years ago when you first got started

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,810
what was the lens because nowadays I

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,550
feel like it's still mainstream right

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,040
look everyone's in it heard of it

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,200
pretends they did like they do it and so

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,760
for you back then

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,790
what was it actually Michael is that

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,370
world like I was exposed to one small

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:05,529
corner so I don't know what it was like

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:08,080
in its entirety one corner was for those

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,180
of you who never used who were working

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,490
on UNIX machines and ever used Sun sight

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,110
Sun sight was a place where you'd get a

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,279
bunch of awesome tools and many of those

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,860
tools were open-source tools

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,150
notably the the tool change GCC and VIN

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:25,830
utils and shells you can get mash not

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:29,040
this crappy UNIX

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,990
the UNIX native whatever UNIX variant he

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,019
worked on UNIX native shells tend tended

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,990
to be a little bit behind behind the

00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,640
times Korn shell orange shell this each

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,019
other the shelves themselves weren't the

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,769
problem is the implementation with the

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:47,250
UNIX specific implementation so there

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:49,740
was that and then I really first got

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,720
started as a user of Linux I had all

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:58,380
these the job that I worked on we used

00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:02,070
Solaris both Sano's four and five so BSD

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:07,170
and more 18t derivative we used schoo

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:09,209
unix we used die next both die necks and

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:15,410
Dynex PTX which would be similar bsd and

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:18,450
AT&T derivatives we used tunics and

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,110
there might be one other there might be

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:24,600
one other UNIX derivative in there and

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,850
everything we did was with GCC we didn't

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,240
use any of the native tool chain on any

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:33,149
of those platforms and all of those

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,950
computers were expensive and they were

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:36,959
either pizza box size or

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,320
refrigerator-sized and none of those

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,450
either size wise or cost wise fit in my

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,670
basement

00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:49,640
and in my basement I had no shortage of

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,500
x86 boxes and a friend of mine said you

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,010
know you can get this thing it's called

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,990
Linux and you can run it on that x86 box

00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,720
and it'll feel like you're running UNIX

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,700
in your basement right hallelujah I

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,240
don't have to steal with some spark box

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,890
from work and risk getting in trouble

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,410
and that's how I got involved it really

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:13,040
as a user it was not long after that

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,360
that I was responsible for the high

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,760
availability of a platform as a

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,850
telecommunications company and in that

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:25,970
world five nines and a J is a really big

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:27,950
thing and I was i met a colleague who

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:31,130
worked on this project called linux aj

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,290
and linux aj was really my first

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:37,880
experience in being a Linux developer or

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:41,170
an open source developer and the

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,740
experience was really remarkable it

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,930
completely changed my life

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,820
I mean honestly not not to be too kind

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,090
of dramatic or hyperbolic but it

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,800
completely changed my life because

00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,380
coding at that point in time was usually

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,340
somebody bequeaths you with this big

00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,320
document written in somebody else's

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,750
language describing a problem that you

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,370
may or may not understand and describing

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,320
a way to solve the problem which may or

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,450
may not make sense and then your job is

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,120
to take that description turn it into

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,939
code

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,639
and so not a lot of creativity there

00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:16,499
necessarily and you're not necessarily

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,230
understanding what's going on and and

00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:21,300
there's this sense of you know the

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,990
omniscient being that knows everything

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,399
in hands you the tablet and being

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,170
involved in an open source community

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,269
where I could just communicate with

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,660
people who were really amazingly skilled

00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:36,360
in this area of high availability share

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,199
some of my knowledge but maybe more

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,050
importantly exposed my lack of knowledge

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,939
in a way that didn't feel so threatening

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,759
I don't know how to do this and people

00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:49,350
would just respond okay have you tried

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,139
this did you think of that and

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,240
ultimately I was able to both learn and

00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,699
then contribute to the project and the

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,610
contributions that I submitted were were

00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:01,920
eagerly welcomed and that whole process

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,910
which in the beginning wasn't didn't

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,899
take very long that whole process was

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,220
totally life-changing in the sense that

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,040
I realized that I could just get

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,019
involved it was my own initiative that

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,389
was all that was required to make an

00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:18,950
impact on a community and I could learn

00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:21,020
from really the

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,320
some of the brightest minds in this

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,990
field in a way that gave me a huge

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,220
opportunity to kind of grow and that was

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,670
the beginning of open source of

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,830
development for me yeah so when I first

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,260
heard of open source especially the

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,690
community open source I heard not so

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:48,290
nice things about it people are you know

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:50,060
can be a little time now obviously a lot

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,450
of patience a lot of knowledge but you

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,980
know it can be a little mean sometimes

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:59,780
when you were starting out were those

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:02,030
issues that you had to deal with in that

00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,670
very beginning not necessarily I may

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,970
administer unique communities smaller so

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,200
it's almost like wow there's another one

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,170
whatever we do to keep that person

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,490
engaged let's do that it wasn't long

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,540
after that and I got involved in the

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,690
kernel community and the kernel

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:22,880
community was much more abrasive and you

00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:26,000
had just had a different way of engaging

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,480
and and I definitely had points in time

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,250
where you know if you could reach

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,160
through the keyboard and throttle

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:37,130
somebody would or or conversely you just

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,780
feel like you've experienced that and

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:44,570
you feel kind of abused and so that that

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:48,280
is the thing I would definitely not want

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,830
to disagree that there's not a cultural

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:55,090
element that can be abrasive and part of

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:59,140
it is time part of it is these are

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:02,560
people and people have different ways of

00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,270
working with each other a big part of an

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,160
open-source community for me is the

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,360
human relationships and the trust

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,430
associated with those human

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,850
relationships and what's interesting

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:15,040
about that in your family you're

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,470
probably more rude to your parents or

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,490
siblings or children than anybody else

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:25,090
around on the planet and that same kind

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,130
of safety of the trust I could be an

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,800
 to you and and it'll be fine

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:32,020
that we'll go have beers or something

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,310
and so there's a little bit of that and

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,660
then also just people have different

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:38,170
skill levels it turns out in

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:42,100
communicating with others and when you

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,500
have it extremely bright people really

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,710
passionate about their ideas you're also

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,870
engaging just at that passion I'm right

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,430
and you're wrong and so there's there's

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,010
a lot of different dynamics that are

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,350
happening in one you know in that

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,050
community context yeah and I imagine the

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,820
community is kind of forced to grow up a

00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,830
bit too right the more mainstream it

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,850
becomes and more people it includes the

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,920
you know what the more ideas are in the

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,260
room you kind of have to be more

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,540
accommodating have you seen any shifts

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,550
in the culture and absolutely absolutely

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,340
in fact in the kernel community we had

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:19,920
some real issues you could pinpoint it

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,920
to a few people and so

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:26,730
who shall remain nameless some of those

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,430
people behind the scenes were actually

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,880
spoken to okay your behaviors is

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,260
damaging to the entire project and and

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm not talking about meanness here that

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,690
was done in public but there were some

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,160
folks who didn't even understand the

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,110
degree to which their behavior was

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,490
off-putting and hurting other people and

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,080
so a little bit of just a direct

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,170
communication and saying you really need

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,250
to think about how your how your voice

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:58,200
impacts other people I suspect that made

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,050
a small impact because a lot of these

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,420
are ingrained behaviors and then at the

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,450
same time more at a kind of project

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,550
level of focus on how do we get more

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,950
people involved if you look at a finite

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,830
pool of people over time there's gonna

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,070
be some attrition and if you have a

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:20,940
finite pool with nutrition that will

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:23,400
approach a pool of zero over time and

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,170
how do you keep onboarding new people

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,510
and for two reasons one just to keep the

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,150
critical mass and two you need to have

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:33,120
fresh ideas it's really easy to get into

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:37,080
an echo chamber and start getting stale

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,540
ideas and you know we wanted the project

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,610
to continue to grow and thrive and one

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,640
of the big values of Linux specifically

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,870
is that it's you know quarter century

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,440
plus it's evolved with

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,090
the technology landscape it's it's

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,030
adapted to all of the changes it's on

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,440
all of the you know I normally it would

00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,180
be in my pocket although right now it's

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,130
over on that chair it's some my phone

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,120
and powering the world's largest

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:07,640
supercomputers and that full entire

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,620
spectrum of hardware that's enabled has

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,050
changed over time so continually

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,580
evolving in a context where also the

00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,710
software that's running is continually

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:20,809
evolving so Hugh and I worked on Zen

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,400
later KPM today a lot of focus in the

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:26,300
industry around containers and all these

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,950
contexts Linux is at the core and how do

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,200
you keep evolving this project to stay

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,870
relevant it requires both code level

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,340
changes but also you know keeping the

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,990
community fresh with new people and new

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,170
ideas and new requirements in your use

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,510
cases and you know if you have a kind of

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,800
a farm policy to accepting newcomers and

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,809
that's that's never gonna happen

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,080
don't worry yeah okay so I want to

00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:50,210
switch gears a bit and talk about the

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,610
business model I guess of open source I

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,030
feel like recently over over time it's

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,250
become more and more corporatized is the

00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,870
word we can use especially just recently

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,059
with Microsoft into buying github the

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,100
largest platform for open source

00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:07,070
projects period is I think one of the

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,420
biggest symbols of you know things kind

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,950
of moving in a more corporate direction

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,170
and I know you represent Red Hat which

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,400
is also a big company but how do you

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,050
feel about that as an open source

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,250
contributors someone has been in the

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,830
community for so long

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,360
now you work for a company company how

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,460
do you pretty navigate that how do you

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,500
think about that it's complicated

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,070
there's the

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:33,100
the first like my first response is we

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:36,309
won we have been at this for a long time

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:40,750
and there is this sense of us against

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:46,510
them and my t-shirt might even resemble

00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:48,669
that and and the US was the community

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:53,980
and the them was proprietary software

00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:57,070
and today so much of the the economy is

00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,850
run through open source developer

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,960
software which is a huge huge huge major

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,919
stepping forward

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:09,669
for for open source communities the flip

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,320
side of that is the part of how we've

00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:14,380
done is through becoming mainstream and

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,990
becoming part of this this economy and

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,659
that means there's a lot of money that's

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:23,919
infused into projects and with that

00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:25,630
money comes this strings yeah there's

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:32,530
definitely strings attached and it

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:33,880
changes the incentives and so the you

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,390
know one of the things that I care about

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,490
is how can we retain the health and

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,720
vibrancy of a community

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:46,060
kind of a community concept while

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,150
embracing a whole set of new developers

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:52,020
who are corporate enterprise developers

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:56,080
I mean the growth of open source is into

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,520
corporate culture and into products and

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,010
running companies many of the new

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,320
full-time developers are coming from

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,240
corporations and making that accessible

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,680
to to those developers making

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,910
open-source communities accessible to

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,900
those developers is really important

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,550
that's how we're going to continue to

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:17,470
grow and give the diversity of use cases

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:19,090
and people but we can't do that at the

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,720
cost of sort of selling out at the

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,040
community concept and you know there's

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,370
definitely a faction within the

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,290
community that's very much just

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,810
counterculture and so that faction I

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:35,370
think we not P would not feel like we've

00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,510
won would feel like we've sold out but

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,730
retaining that kind of core community

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,190
principle I think is the hard part and

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,980
one of the things that I've seen in the

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,950
industry and I know many here probably

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,600
participated in this process is we have

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:54,700
all of these organizations that support

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,950
open source projects foundations and to

00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,870
me I sometimes refer to the foundation

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:03,280
as corporatization of open source

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:05,380
development and I mean that literally as

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,700
well as a tongue-in-cheek with the

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,580
negative connotation that comes along

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,660
with that and the literal piece is we

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,200
really do have more

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,180
input into the process and the concern

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,740
that comes along with that is where's

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:25,230
the soul of the community and the

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,640
governance process is put in place to

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,930
make it comfortable for all these

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,340
corporate entities to be involved

00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,290
because they don't know any other way

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,570
and if we didn't allow for that we

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,640
wouldn't be including those members into

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:40,350
the community and if that's all that we

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:42,060
have then we may lose the real core

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,440
value of the community and so I think

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:49,860
there's a balance and a tension there

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:51,120
and I see the value of a foundation and

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,120
one of the things that were most about

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,310
is you've put a lot of resources behind

00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,430
the project and with those resources

00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,930
that is that's dollars its funding those

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,700
resources one of the major things that

00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,610
foundation can do for a project is

00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,220
marketing and marketers are really good

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:12,270
at marketing things and when you market

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:15,000
a project independent of its maturity

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,590
level you can really create a set

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,150
expectations for the industry and some

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,040
of the things we've seen in the last

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,170
five years our projects that have huge

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,520
marketing budgets get a lot of focus in

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:28,350
the industry don't quite meet the

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,850
expectations and then there's a lot of

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:34,040
dashed hopes and and so you know I think

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,360
responsible thinking about what is

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,190
what's the value of supporting a project

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,370
which is mostly about the developers and

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:43,980
the users and getting the right message

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:47,790
out at the right time is it's a tough

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:50,430
yeah I mean the doctor project didn't

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,950
exist one day and sort of went viral the

00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:56,490
next day and really helped change the

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:58,980
focus of the industry and there's

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,770
something really cool about that and

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,000
then there's all of the kind of

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:07,770
marketing corporate interests that can

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,120
confuse some of the messaging yeah it

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,000
kind of makes me want to ask the

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,610
question what is open-source at its

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,780
absolute core I was um I was in a room

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,250
where there was this was being debated

00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,500
and a friend of mine set next to me and

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,180
she said you know all this debate about

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,640
the open source community and the

00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,530
corporations and the people that's not

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,150
what it is open source is purely about

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,470
the license that's the whole thing the

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,270
whole thing is just the license and and

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,220
it's not really much wasn't that for we

00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,840
disagree yeah and so I was like oh she's

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,610
she's a pretty big up was different and

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,650
I thought really really that's how you

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,600
how you look at it but it doesn't make

00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,460
me wonder now that there's all these

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,320
players that didn't exist before there's

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,090
corporate input there's foundations

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,020
they're people who get paid to do with

00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,080
the people who are doing it you know

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,360
nights weekends what what does open

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,690
source actually boil down to and your

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,690
opinion

00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:02,330
it might be a sort of a cliche word but

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,100
it's collaboration and the so the reason

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,260
I don't think it's a license for one

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,720
there's many open-source licenses and

00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,700
they all have different and subtle

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:14,270
implications of how that license can be

00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,400
used so there's kind of the most

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,049
restrictive open-source license and the

00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,370
least restrictive open-source license

00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,840
and the least restrictive open-source

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,220
license allows you to take open source

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,010
code and embedded and proprietary

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,559
software and the most restrictive

00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,299
doesn't allow for that so I just with

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,250
that spectrum alone I feel like that you

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:33,649
can't define open source system as the

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,179
license to me it's much more about the

00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:36,830
collaboration and most importantly about

00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:40,010
the contribution and the reason I think

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,539
about the contribution is that same

00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:48,169
license spectrum which allows you to

00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:50,720
take code and abscond with it may or may

00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:53,230
not be how a community treats the code

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,990
that they're that they're working on so

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,669
the community culture and the

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,770
expectation for collaboration and

00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:03,049
contribution is independent of the

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,429
actual license and it's the community

00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,200
culture and the collaboration

00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:08,090
contribution I think it is open sources

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,279
you know your output is code that you're

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,730
developing your community is developers

00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,640
and users and you're facilitating that

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:19,730
with a license to a degree you know you

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,740
can freely redistribute the code but

00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,160
it's not a license the license is more

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:27,180
of a tool

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:30,240
and and it's really important that GPL

00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:33,810
versus VSD and can I embed this in my

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,730
proprietary code or not doesn't seem to

00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,920
be the driving force for how much people

00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,210
contribute back to a project it's more

00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,600
the community the culture the

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,620
expectation that creates that and I

00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,110
think that's a really important

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,440
distinction so it to me it's that it's

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,000
collaboration it's the contribution both

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:56,010
code contributions as well as bug

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,070
reports and documentation and users

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,870
participating that is that collaboration

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:04,680
and contribution are the key of an

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:06,150
open-source community so one thing that

00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,790
I was personally excited about with the

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,380
corporatization of open-source is the

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,910
money that goes with that right because

00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,680
I think we like to think that

00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,900
open-source is accessible to everyone

00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,910
but the reality is for a long time as

00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,520
accessible to people who already had

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,380
good day jobs and could afford to do a

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,960
lot of really great work but you do it

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,450
for free and now with foundations and

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,220
funding and outreach is a you know great

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,140
program that allows for people to

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,749
actually get paid to do this work have

00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,759
you seen the the benefits

00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:38,190
diversifying the community and bringing

00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,350
in different people who may not be at

00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:44,690
that point of privilege where they could

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:48,239
just kind of do it for free yes

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,389
absolutely I hope the numbers are still

00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:53,879
small I'd love it to be bigger than home

00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:56,850
but I was reading an article recently

00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:59,850
and it was the the premise of the

00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:03,389
article was just go learn that language

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:07,190
and then you can get involved in a in a

00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:07,190
project that is written in that language

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:14,129
implicit in that is an assumption of

00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:20,090
that you have the free time to go learn

00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:22,559
the language and there is some kind of

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,499
privilege that comes along with that and

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,570
the focus that I see in the industry

00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:29,429
right now is not just only on the code

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:33,299
and the foundations but also on trying

00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:35,519
to be more broadly inclusive and knowing

00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:38,609
that our communities long drive survive

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,879
and thrive without a more diverse inputs

00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:45,359
is probably the first knowing is half of

00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:48,440
the battle and some of the work that

00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:50,360
we've done to help improve the

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,190
diversity and inclusion within

00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,620
communities is all over the mountain

00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,040
from here we've been able to bring some

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,800
new members to the community through

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,150
funding and scholarships here at Def Con

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,670
which is awesome I know there's some

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,960
folks here that are been able to take

00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:08,450
advantage of that and we're really

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,060
excited about bringing in new new

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,340
contributors many of the foundations

00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,490
actually have scholarship programs that

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:19,310
try to incorporate people into the

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,780
community through largely conferences

00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,220
and getting people to travel because

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,230
that's where you meet and have the high

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,380
bandwidth and face-to-face communication

00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:31,040
which is unique compared with digital

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:35,960
communication and if you look at some of

00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:40,220
the statistics there's they're not that

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,710
awesome frankly I saw marina put

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,810
together some numbers for me and one of

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:51,010
the things that stood out was a survey

00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:53,660
of the github community that the

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:56,390
diversity levels are really really

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,680
really low and then if you look at some

00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,400
other communities are a little higher so

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,890
it's like 3%

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:07,559
and github and roughly 10% in

00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:08,940
communities like the colonel and in any

00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,670
case that's low

00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,450
but that 3% number really struck me and

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:18,990
even internally at Red Hat our internal

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,090
numbers aren't that aren't that high and

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,980
so what we need to do as an industry and

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,280
with what we're doing within Red Hat is

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:31,190
look at that and where are your biases

00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,190
