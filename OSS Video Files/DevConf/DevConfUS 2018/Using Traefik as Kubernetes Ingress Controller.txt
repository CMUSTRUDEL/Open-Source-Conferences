Title: Using Traefik as Kubernetes Ingress Controller
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	This talk will introduce Traefik, the open source reverse-proxy/load-balancer, which can be used as an Ingress Controller in your container infrastructure. Using an Ingress controller allows you to configure routing to services based on host name, port, and path rather than exposing them directly.

Traefik is an Ingress Controller which interfaces to backends such as Kubernetes, Docker, Mesos, Consul allowing dynamic updating of the routing configuration without service loss.

We will look at what is a reverse-proxy, an Ingress Controller and Traefik through demonstration and discussion.
