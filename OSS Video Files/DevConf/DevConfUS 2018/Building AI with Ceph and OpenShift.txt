Title: Building AI with Ceph and OpenShift
Publication date: 2019-02-21
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Artificial Intelligence has become quite the hot topic lately. Companies large and small are scrambling to figure out how they can build products that leverage it. In a very fast paced market where new tools are being introduced for data scientists seemingly every week, one thing hasnâ€™t changed: the need for LOTS of quality data.

In this session, we will discuss how to support AI data scientists by building a data lake and machine learning platform in OpenShift using a few common open source products. Ceph will be deployed as the backbone of the data lake. We will show how to use Spark and OpenWhisk in OpenShift to create a pipeline for processing data. We will also enable data scientists to create and execute AI models by connecting all of these technologies in a Jupyter notebook.
