Title: Data Hub for CI of Red Hat Products
Publication date: 2019-02-21
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Data Hub is Red Hat internal data lake platform. Data Hub is extensively used for log aggregation and build log/test result aggregation.

I will present our architecture and best practices operating a data lake platform called ‘Data Hub’. I will present the major use cases of how we aggregate, replicate and analyze the data from internal and upstream Continuous Integration systems, from traditional and containerized applications. I will show how we do correlation of test results generated by the CI systems, Fedora project message bus(FedMsg), internal Red Hat message bus and how we onboard new CI systems in Data Hub.

The architecture for Data Hub includes: ELK stack, Kafka and other tools. You can expect to see slides and demo in the presentation.
