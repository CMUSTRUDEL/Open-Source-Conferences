Title: RPM Scriptlet Reformery
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	RPM scriptlets are still pretty awful - but they're getting better! This talk will discuss the problems with package scriptlets and the progress of our efforts in the Fedora Project to fix things, so package installs and image builds can be faster and more reliable.

Anyone who is familiar with package scriptlets in Fedora is welcome, and anyone who works on packaging tools and policies is encouraged to attend.
