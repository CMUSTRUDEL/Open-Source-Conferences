Title: Electro-Thermal Conductivity Cylindrical Proteins
Publication date: 2019-02-20
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	In recent years, the research teams at BSS Labs have made great strides in understanding the thermal and electromagnetic properties of muscle tissue. Most of their experiments have been done on cellulose casings in the shape of truncated cylinders capped on each end by hemispheres. This casing is generally filled with a mixture of approximately 75% water, 20% protein, 2% fat, 1% carbohydrates, and 2% soluble non-protein substances. In recent years the most prevalent ways of cooking these beefy circular cylindrical capsules have been to grill, pan fry, boil, or microwave them. However, thanks to a significant archaeological discovery by one of their senior scientists, BSS Labs have rediscovered a revolutionary way to heat beefy capsules to an edible temperature. This is achieved by implanting conical iron electrodes into either end of a beefy circular cylindrical capsule and then passing an electric current through it. Through arduous and painstaking scientific experimentation, the team at BSS Labs has concluded that, of all known cooking methods, electrocution yields the most optimal cook time to taste quality ratio. Many of their senior scientists claim that what they have uncovered is a Beefy Miracle.

if you're calling me up yeah yeah I'm

00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:20,010
fine I just saw yesterday how do I

00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:20,010
present this awesome

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,840
from business laughter yeah yeah

00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,660
for like 30 seconds

00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,260
this part doesn't play

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,100
you did good

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,940
hi everybody first I would like to

announce that there will be a reprise of

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,930
this talk on Sunday in the morning so if

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,730
there's something you have that's

00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,210
conflicting you could also check it out

00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:44,070
then however today I would like to

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:47,260
announce and welcome to the stage our

one of our most senior the senior

00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,140
scientists from BSS labs and he's here

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,530
to give you a presentation that like

00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,210
it's just awe-inspiring we are really

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,400
really excited that he was willing to do

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,490
this for us and so we really hope you

00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,980
enjoy it and like if you don't learn

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,610
something here today clearly the problem

00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:13,500
is with you so thank you for coming and

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,500
please please welcome Jacob Kozol

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,300
[Music]

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:31,370
friends family

00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:39,319
steamed colleagues gracious guests I

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:42,120
welcome you to explore hot dogs hot dogs

00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,849
are ubiquitous part of American and

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,610
global life everybody eats them

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,150
celebrities eat them when you go to a

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,400
ballgame

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,170
of course you eat a hotdog maybe even a

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,910
ballpark dog the presidents all eat them

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,010
but as thing about hot dogs is they're

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,920
pretty standard how you cook a hot dog

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,260
you can bake them you can boil them pan

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,090
fry them grill the microwave them the

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,530
these methods of cooking hot dogs have

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,060
been passed down by generations and

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:15,000
there's very little variation but thanks

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,940
to a fellow senior scientist at BSS labs

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,030
we have uncovered a method of cooking

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,139
hot dogs that was left in the past I

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:28,109
present to you the presto hot dogger

00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:31,459
this claims to cook hot dogs in 60

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:34,260
seconds and it can cook six hot dogs

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,420
here is the packaging that was found

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,769
with the archeological study as you can

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:45,000
see very much a 70s product quality

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:48,120
quality logo here and now we get to the

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,489
technique this is a fascinating method

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,880
of cooking hot dogs almost archaic in

00:03:50,489 --> 00:04:00,420
the presentation you stick the hot dog I

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,280
need a Mike mr. Mike mr. Mike

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,700
should have a cookie about where the

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,700
solution

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:31,420
egg okay that works yep I'd hear me in

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,420
the back

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,770
so let me redirect your attention to

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,660
these metallic spikes we take these

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,260
conical electrodes and we plug them into

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,110
either end of the hotdog allowing us to

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,820
plug the machine into the wall running a

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,480
hundred and twenty volts through it and

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,430
cooking these dogs in 60 seconds as you

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,390
see here it includes a very helpful

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,460
pamphlet you separate the cover cover 1

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,750
to 6 you can decide maybe you're cooking

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,770
for yourself and you only want 1 or 2

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,330
maybe you're cooking for your whole

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,180
family you fill it up with six hot dogs

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,220
and you can do this in one go you insert

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,540
the cover back on and you put it in the

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,580
wall and there you go

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,980
60 seconds and these hot dogs are going

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,260
to come out and perfectly cooked now I

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,990
want to also emphasize this is

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,480
specifically for frankfurters it says

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,050
nothing about sausages or any other

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,650
conical-shaped meat product simply

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,960
frankfurters now for our testing we used

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,270
for brands to get a variety to make sure

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,730
there is a consistency of quality we

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,060
used Oscar Mayer classic uncured wieners

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,250
ballpark Franks lightlife smart dogs for

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,540
the vegans out there and Hebrew national

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,700
we also wanted that variety we have

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,010
turkey chicken and pork in one chicken

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,370
and pork in one and then that solo beef

00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,910
Hebrew National

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,740
as you can see the packaging I want to

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,620
direct your attention right now to the

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,070
horizontal nature of the ballpark and

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,020
veggie dog packaging and the vertical

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:16,120
nature of the Hebrew National

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:19,580
and Oscar Mayer wiener packaging now

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,940
before we can plunge into the depths of

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,030
electrocuting hot dogs we must first

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,310
understand how does a hot dog cook in a

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,830
traditional manner so we ran it through

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,340
the standard five cooking methods

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,950
started with a pan fry took four minutes

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,210
and 15 seconds to heat the pan up to

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,010
temperature with a little bit of butter

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,110
in it to make sure the hot dog got nice

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,540
and brown and fried and then we let them

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,630
cook for three minutes and ten seconds

00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,760
exactly this led to a very linear

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,660
temperature scale they all started

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,880
around 76 77 degrees Fahrenheit and over

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,220
those three minutes and 10 seconds they

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,950
were able to climb up to about a hundred

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:05,510
and sixty two to 165 degrees Fahrenheit

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,669
we then moved on to the microwave a

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,110
lesser-known

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:12,200
predominantly dorm room inspired method

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,349
of hook cooking hot dogs very fast no

00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,139
preheat time and then we did a standard

00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:21,440
hundred second cook for all of the hot

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:24,289
dogs this had a little bit more variety

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,150
as you notice the veggie dog and Oscar

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:28,370
Mayer were a little lower temperature at

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,410
the end whereas the Hebrew national in

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,450
ballpark Frank's kind of climbed up at

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,960
the temperature that might be more the

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:39,520
single and double source of meat versus

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,900
the triple and veggie dog

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,570
moving on of course to the oven we bake

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,090
them preheated for about 15 minutes to

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,910
400 degrees Fahrenheit and then cooked

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,220
for an additional 15 minutes some ovens

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,570
may vary but for 400 degrees Fahrenheit

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:59,330
15 minutes as a solid cook time and in

00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,650
this instance pretty even scaling for

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,630
all of the hotdogs

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,730
however the Oscar Mayer heated up pretty

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,830
quickly and that's actually a tendency

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,260
we noticed in general it's a smaller hot

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,490
dog so maybe that is why it cooks a

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,400
little bit faster it gets to a higher

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,280
temperature quicker moving on

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,680
to boiling it took my stove 14 minutes

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,200
to boil it generally it'll range from 10

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,840
to 15 minutes to get wired to a boil and

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,760
then cooking for exactly 5 minutes all

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,680
of the hotdogs at once with the boil

00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,570
because you can fill a nice pot and a

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,150
strong variation here

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,349
ballpark Frank's really not getting up

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,030
in the temperature quite quite edible

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,000
still according to the sources a little

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,669
salty a little chewy but edible Oscar

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,580
Meyer again high temperature leads to a

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,769
more solid kind of mouthfeel

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,500
and then the one everybody knows

00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:54,870
grilling a hotdog took us 20 minutes we

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,970
let the coals let it preheat and then

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,089
cook for exactly eight minutes that led

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,950
to good results with our grill generally

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,500
we found seven to nine minutes is the

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,350
ideal range for cooking a hot dog on the

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,680
grill fairly even temperature climb

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,410
getting higher up there and 180 no 190

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,410
200 and they all came out with like a

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,269
nice amount of browning on the surface

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,690
that crispy kind of crunch you expect

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:23,880
when you bite into a grilled hot dog so

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,390
now we move on to what we're all here

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,640
for electrocuting them we started by

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,060
taking a resistance at a base

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,890
temperature Oscar Mayer and ballpark

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,930
Frank up there with two point one and

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,730
two megaohms and then the lightlife

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,980
veggie dogs in Hebrew national lower

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,260
with the point two five and point 5 mega

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,600
ohms assuming that that might be a

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,940
result of the higher sodium content and

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,720
the Oscar Mayer ballpark Franks or the

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,220
variety of meats products within now

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,620
here's a here's what it looks like when

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,570
you line them all up you get a nice

00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,370
amount of separation between each dog

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,910
and actually as you see there's a bit of

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,370
a curvature this allows a little bit of

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,920
a spark in between and kind of gets that

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,170
if that kind of sealed down the side

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,079
which will pop open to let the juices

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,000
open up but not come out so that way you

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,339
when you put it in your bun the juices

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,310
will fill up its fill out perfectly but

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,110
won't be wasted now we see some

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,360
interesting temperature climbs here not

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,670
a very linear progression heber national

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,500
very slow to heat up I think that's

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,850
because of the single beef source there

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,740
however spiking up well into 168 degrees

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,420
Fahrenheit whereas the rest had a more

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,710
linear progression and all ended up

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,840
around 160

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,940
so some quotes from the experiments this

00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,700
is all of course with the most important

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,240
method which was the electrocution Oscar

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:53,570
Mayer technically warmer warmer in the

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,390
center than the edges and actually this

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,070
Oscar Mayer experiment showed us that if

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,650
she go back here we started with 60

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,450
seconds as we were directed but we

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:05,240
realized that a hundred second cook time

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,560
is much better for the hot dog or it

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,680
gives you a little bit more of a crunch

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,400
on the inside and a generally warm

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,040
inside versus here it's technically warm

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,080
so the ballpark Frank's right kind of

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,140
split that's due to that kind of curve

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,930
you get with that dog gets a nice split

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:27,190
not very hot turning into who this one's

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,620
pretty hot surface temperature was high

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,350
cold and dead on the inside you can all

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,290
relate a little bit than the veggie dogs

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,430
ooh

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:43,330
surprisingly warm tofu licious and

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:47,330
synthetic smoke taste a dope mouthfeel

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:50,540
and finally the Hebrew National this

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:53,120
one's better better than the last more

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,330
evenly cooked again benefiting from the

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,030
hundred second cook time smells like a

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,120
hot dog this one tastes like a hot dog

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:05,320
that's actually cooked and of course I'm

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,320
a really bad vegan

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,890
so now the comparison we averaged out

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,140
the cook time results for initial temp

00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,150
and final temp for all the hotdogs we

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,430
scaled it down into a time range of a

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,500
hundred and seconds and here you can see

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,570
that the hotdogs are coming from a very

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,050
low initial temperature ends up

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,550
skyrocketing up very quickly even kind

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,150
of beating out the microwaves a little

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,130
bit in this one example and then we kind

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,670
of go down pan-fried pretty quick

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,340
the little lowers drilling it boiling

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,040
and baking both very slow because of

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,630
that preheat time and then a long a cup

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,500
of time now we talked about the charring

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,710
everybody likes a charred hot dog you

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,540
want that outside to be crunchy but what

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,600
about the inside why does the inside

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,210
have to be soft as you can see here by

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,440
the nature of plugging in the hot dog

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,530
and running electricity through the

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,010
inside of it you get a nice char on the

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:12,620
inside so you can see the split that was

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:14,600
so talked about very juicy and now we

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,760
thought what about larger stalks what

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,000
what if you want to break barriers and

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,430
go for that sausage well you don't need

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,300
to linearly align them you can actually

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,940
push them over one even two slots and

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,070
you can fill up more space as you can

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,269
see here these are some fat hot dogs now

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:39,360
and they have plenty of space to grow

00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:41,610
now what is what is a hot dog if you if

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
you don't try and see what limits it can

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,829
handle what does it take to make a pot

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,980
dog pop when running 120 volts through

00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:52,440
it so we did a reading experiment the

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,279
Oscar Mayer and the veggie dog and we

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:59,250
ran them both at 58 seconds big popping

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:02,399
sound 75 seconds a little bit of an

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,720
electric sizzle a hundred seconds this

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,850
is when we really could tell they are

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,570
cooking because it just started smelling

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,630
like straight burning paper 128 second

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,870
step paper smells gone it just smells

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,970
terrible

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,230
150 seconds that's when the smoke starts

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,329
really coming out of the machine not

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,139
just inside but coming out of the cover

00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,730
smells truck charred now due to safety

00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,260
concerns we had to shut down the

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,380
experiment at this point we want to pop

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,649
not a burn the veggie dog came out at

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,930
171 point 2 degrees Fahrenheit and feels

00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:37,290
so weird as you can see here I

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,660
understand why it feels so weird

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:45,260
and the inside after pushing it that

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:49,320
much nice and charred no brand verdict

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,990
first the Hebrew national solo beef dog

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,300
having a single source of meat really

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,450
benefits the hot dog it allows that even

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,220
cook that even flavor Oscar Mayer

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,630
follows up the Hebrew National Black

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,150
heating up pretty well so his

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:06,840
consistently warm a solid taste very

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,790
well orchestrated hot dog that falls up

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,950
by the veggie dog actually beating out

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,210
the ballpark dog so if you ever gone for

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,050
a ballpark dog maybe just go for the

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,590
veggie dog instead

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,990
now Hebrew National Oscar Mayer number

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,190
one and two veggie dog ballpark number

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,910
three and four I'm gonna go back a

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,910
couple slides

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:35,770
okay as you see here while parking

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:40,420
veggie dogs horizontally aligned keeper

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:42,940
national Oscar Mayer vertical so if you

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,410
ever not not too sure about which hotdog

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,640
Brandt is to take because there's many

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,040
if you go to the store and there's a

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,630
whole aisle of hotdogs go for that

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,460
vertical packaging that vertical

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,680
branding a hundred percent of the time

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,680
it's going to beat out the horizontals

00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:05,470
okay so now what everybody's here for

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,949
how do the various methods of cooking a

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,970
hot dog compare of course the fan

00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:11,790
favorite is the grill

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:16,629
everybody likes a grilled hot dog it

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,819
quote-unquote tastes like hot dog pan

00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:20,410
frying it also very successful it's good

00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:22,870
if you can't don't have a grill you have

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,970
to be inside pan frying very solid

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,589
choice to number three however was the

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,810
hot dogger people were pleasantly

00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,660
surprised a little uncertain going in

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:34,420
about an electrocuted hot dog but the

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,720
taste was generally sufficient beating

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:41,079
out baking boiling and microwaving a hot

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,000
dog but this is where the hot dogger

00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,500
starts to really shine of course a

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,879
microwave is very fast we give it a

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,379
number one slot because there's no

00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,939
cleanup you just put it on the plate and

00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,620
you microwave it maybe you put some

00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:53,680
paper towels around to make sure that

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,870
the moisture is correct but hot dog or

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,829
microwave very competitive there the pan

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,470
fry comes in at a solid third following

00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:04,270
those is boiling oven and grill because

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,670
of the lengthy preheat times and the

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,520
lengthy cook times

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:12,640
so now we take that ratio of quality

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,430
time and number one comes in as the hot

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,720
dogger because it had satisfying quality

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:22,570
and high high speed cook pan fry again

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,640
this good quality decent time so if

00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,380
you're don't have access to a hot dog

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,570
there and I feel so sorry for you if you

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,560
don't have access to the hot dogger I

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:34,570
would highly recommend a pan frying them

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,100
grilling comes in after that grilling is

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,940
just a solid way if you if you want to

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:42,010
impress somebody grill the hot dog

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:49,810
microwave better than boiling for time

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:52,150
and then boil and bake I would like to

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:55,480
thank our sponsors this was all done in

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:58,390
collaboration with GWS and then our

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,120
senior scientists David Cantrell senior

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:06,880
scientist David Jie and senior scientist

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:09,750
Sofia fondo and remember the mustard

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,750
indicates progress

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:26,290
okay okay all right questions any

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,290
questions in the back

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,980
ways to

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,230
but I'm gonna saved a minute put down

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:44,419
crying hotdogs and

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,419
here in a country that

00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:52,929
so it that's a great question I I think

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,440
the the issue with a fried hot dog is

00:18:52,929 --> 00:19:00,390
that Jennifer oh okay so the question

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:04,690
asked was why did we not fry the hot dog

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,130
and the answer to that is when you when

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,540
you want to fry something generally you

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,890
want to apply a batter to it you can

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,500
think of like a corndog where you

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,390
surround the hot dog and a batter frying

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,830
a hot dog the solo is not really the

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,230
standard method of cooking it because

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:22,150
it'll be superior with that coating so

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:26,140
we discounted that method additional

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:30,040
questions so obviously not everyone has

00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:33,370
access to a hot dog at home what is your

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,670
go-to method at home when you want a hot

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,820
dog

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,250
summer what is the question was what is

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,679
my go-to method to cook a hot dog at

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,450
home assuming I don't have access to a

00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,490
hot dogger because of course I would go

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,280
for the hot dogger and my answer to that

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,320
is that in warm weather months I would

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,090
go for the grill I would take that extra

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,640
time I would commit to it I think it's

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,860
worth deciding in advance that you want

00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,900
a grilled hot dog however if it's winter

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:03,230
months the grill is not as practical so

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,900
I would go for the pan fry another

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:10,210
question did you consider using the hot

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,210
dogger with a 220 volts option

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:18,660
that is annexed we found is actually oh

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,330
so the question was do we consider the

00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,060
to run 220 volts through the hot dogger

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:27,000
instead of 120 and the issue we ran into

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,700
was getting that from a standard outlet

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,940
we want to experiment and what would a

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,450
person at home use however that is a

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,070
great foray into more experimental

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,380
methods of cooking hot dogs or we can

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,780
really start upping the voltage the

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,350
current going through them test what a

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:50,390
hot dog can withstand additional

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,390
question within men in the red

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,869
the question was would we consider

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:04,710
expanding this to other foodstuffs

00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:07,019
within the hot dogger and absolutely we

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,279
actually have recently come across

00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:13,590
another model of the hot dogger and

00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,909
different branding and that if you pay

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,049
attention to flock maybe next year there

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:19,379
might be in another talk with that

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:20,789
included and we would love to have more

00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,580
foodstuffs what happens when you put a

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,559
carrot in the hot dog dirt of course the

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,580
sausage the sausage we have to try out

00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:32,429
sausages maybe an expanded foray into

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,759
non meat based hotdogs and a whole gamut

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:39,029
of different types of veggie dogs

00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,179
bananas vennett another question in the

00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:41,179
back

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:55,580
the question is why didn't we experiment

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:59,450
with a sous-vide so we had many culinary

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,490
experts on our panel of tasters and the

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,340
sous-vide is a very popular choice in

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,799
cooking meats currently unfortunately

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,899
what we did have sponsors our funding

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,389
was limited and so sous-vide has been

00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:17,889
put on the docket for the next round of

00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:17,889
testing another question

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,450
directions

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,320
I'm kind of freaking us but I like

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,420
and when you speculate

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,900
out of the hot dogger handle something

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,600
like explain to the way that the hot dog

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,970
graph

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:43,600
oh that is an exceptional question okay

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:47,080
so the question was how would the hot

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,850
dog got a swanky swanky Frank how would

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,889
a hot dogger handle a swanky Frankie

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,259
which is a hot dog with bacon wrapped

00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:55,360
around it now of course you're gonna

00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,669
have to push that cook time you're gonna

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,380
make sure I would not do the 220 volts

00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,269
with a hot dog we're trying to cook the

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,389
bacon on the outside because it's an

00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:06,460
inside-out method of cooking so you run

00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:09,759
the risk of the bacon maybe not fully

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,470
cooking I would postulate that the bacon

00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,629
would be slightly undercooked but

00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,669
probably will hit an edible temperature

00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:17,500
you might want to experiment with we

00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:20,110
mentioned sous-vide maybe you sous-vide

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,940
the bacon apply it to the hotdog and

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,590
then when you put it in the hotdog you

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:31,539
get that nice charring from the

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:34,210
electricity any additional questions one

00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:37,210
acquires a hotdog or by laborious and

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:40,090
meticulous searching on a website like

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,580
eBay or searching through your parents

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:46,649
attic it's surprising how many families

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,649
purchase these presto hot doggers

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,649
right there and they add one in their

00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:58,159
house any additional questions well it's

00:23:54,649 --> 00:24:00,320
been an absolute pleasure it's kind of a

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,690
beefy miracle that this all was able to

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,649
happen so thank you for your time and

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,649
