Title: Property-based Testing in Python and Rust
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Property-based testing is a form of testing where the test specifies a property to test, and the testing library generates many examples for which the property can be tested. Writing a property-based test is generally more difficult that writing an example-based test, however property-based testing is generally much more powerful than the more usual example-based testing.

hypothesis-python is a powerful and easy-to-use property-based testing library for Python. proptest is a relatively new property-based testing library based on ideas from hypothesis-python implemented in Rust.

This talk will introduce the principles of property-based testing, discuss some misconceptions about its domain, and introduce hypothesis-python and proptest by means of some examples.
