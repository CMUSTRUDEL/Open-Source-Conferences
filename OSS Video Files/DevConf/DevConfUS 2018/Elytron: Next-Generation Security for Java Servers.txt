Description: 
	Elytron is a new security framework for WildFly that unifies security across the whole application server. It has replaced the combination of PicketBox and the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) as the WildFly client and server security mechanism. In this session, we’ll first touch on some security history to understand the motivation for introducing Elytron. Then, we’ll dive into what Elytron is and learn about its core concepts, including authentication and authorization. By the end of the session, you will understand how to secure Java EE applications deployed to WildFly using Elytron.
