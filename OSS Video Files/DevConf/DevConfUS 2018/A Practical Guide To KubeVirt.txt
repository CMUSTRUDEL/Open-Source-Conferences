Title: A Practical Guide To KubeVirt
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	KubeVirt is a robust Virtual Machine management infrastructure that runs on and leverages the core concepts of Kubernetes. The APIs used by KubeVirt will feel very familiar to the seasoned Kubernetes user, but that doesn't cover everybody.

This session is designed to arm users with the practical experience they'll need to deploy Virtual Machines using KubeVirt. We will start with a Virtual Machine running on a local Qemu instance, and using concrete examples, discuss the steps needed to move it to the hybrid cloud. This will cover the Custom Resources used by KubeVirt as well as other considerations such as storage and networking.
