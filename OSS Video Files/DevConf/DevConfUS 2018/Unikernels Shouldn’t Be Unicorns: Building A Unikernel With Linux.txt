Title: Unikernels Shouldn’t Be Unicorns: Building A Unikernel With Linux

Description: 
	Unikernels are showing increasing promise as a new operating system model for cloud applications that enables deep per-application optimization. Given their short startup times, unikernels are ideal for deploying microservices. A significant concern about the unikernel model is that all of today’s unikernels are reliant on almost untested software, throwing away the value of the battle-tested Linux code base and requiring a fundamentally new community, resulting in huge maintainability challenges to a company that wants to support them. This project shows our work on creating a unikernel by making negligible changes to Linux code base, making it simple to make application-specific unikernels. Applications already running on Linux will require little or no changes to be deployed on this Linux based unikernel, allowing ease of use.
