Title: Operating Human Systems: MTTR v. MTBF
Publication date: 2019-02-25
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Trends indicate that optimizing for shortened repair time is preferred over optimizing for longer time between failures. I would even go as far to say, optimizing to avoid failure, makes worse systems overall. But do we ever think to apply this Complex Systems logic to our complex human relationships? I believe that our human interactions in tech communities can be improved by optimizing for shorter time to relationship over longer time between fallouts.

This session will discuss:
* Why optimizing MTTR is better than MTBF
* How human communities operate like complex systems and why optimizing MTTR is better here, too.
* Discuss tools and techniques for shortening recovery cycles between people
* Provide usable techniques and resources for improving your OSS and other communities
