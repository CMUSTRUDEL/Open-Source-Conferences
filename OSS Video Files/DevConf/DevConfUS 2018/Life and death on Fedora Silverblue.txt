Title: Life and death on Fedora Silverblue
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	I have converted my main work machine to Fedora Silverblue at the beginning of the year, and resolved to learning my way around as a developer in this new environment. My presentation will summarize the experience I've had. I will also highlight some of the tricks and best practices I've learned and the pitfalls I narrowly avoided.
If hope that you come away from this session eager to try out Fedora Silverblue. But if you say: I'd rather wait until those remaining rough corners are polished away, that is an okay outcome, too.
