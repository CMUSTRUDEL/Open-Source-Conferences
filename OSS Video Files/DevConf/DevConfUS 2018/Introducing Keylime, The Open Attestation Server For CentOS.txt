Title: Introducing Keylime, The Open Attestation Server For CentOS
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	A tenant who hosts its security-sensitive data in today's cloud has limited ability to verify the underlying cloud platform.
Keylime, a scalable, trusted cloud key management system, provides an end-to-end solution for both bootstrapping hardware rooted cryptographic identities for IaaS nodes and system integrity monitoring of those nodes via periodic attestation.
We will present how we are importing this critical system into RHEL based Linux. Using Keylime, a RHEL using tenant can ensure its cloud node is not compromised. This guarantee includes the node's firmware, tenant's operating system, and its applications.

also what is the overhead of running

00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,820
this integrity check sure so we have a

00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:14,219
skirt I can create the whitelist and it

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,480
basically just lists all your files that

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,100
are good on the machine in a good State

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:26,640
as for the overhead I don't know the

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:29,450
exact numbers it's on the paper okay so

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,450
no overhead

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,070
how the question spinner

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,930
[Music]

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,020
so remote as stations being around for a

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,040
long time you know why is this something

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,420
new what's why it's it's important so

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,010
part of it is that we can implement in a

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,600
cloud system so one thing that we didn't

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,710
go into too much is the use of virtual

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,750
TPMS so virtual TPMS can send a deep

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,330
quote to the actual the real TPM on the

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,479
machine which can then sign those those

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,910
quotes so that's part of it the the low

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,680
overhead of this I think is also that

00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,580
there's no other open source and open

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,580
source of course yeah

00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:23,220
any more questions all right thank you

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,110
very much you all that is able we wrap

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:33,240
for the collaboratory dryer thanks as FM

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,610
leo we do have a couple of a few

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,530
additional collaboratory related talks

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,200
tomorrow that i hope you will all make

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,750
it out to in particular the mix and mess

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,740
talk I see mr. mixon match here in the

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:52,380
back right now I'm Kristy and while you

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,000
can so do please track those down and

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,390
enjoy the rest of the conference

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,340
oh and to also to tracing talks which

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,910
which Lily and MRI already talked about

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,910
