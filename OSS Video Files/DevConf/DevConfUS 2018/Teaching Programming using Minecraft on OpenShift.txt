Title: Teaching Programming using Minecraft on OpenShift
Publication date: 2019-02-22
Playlist: DevConfUS 2018
Description: 
	Computers used to be these "magical tinkering machines" when we were younger. Today, the challenge is to get children excited about learning programming by reducing the time to setup and get started right away in a gamified environment they already love - like Minecraft! We'll show you how with Kubernetes, OpenShift and Minecraft we can progressively do just - at first using our ScratchX extension to get started with graphical programming, and then with a push of a button go to a full development environment set up to start learning and teaching programming. We'll set up an Eclipse Che IDE with continuous builds of the modifications, and a Minecraft server with our OSGi extension that hot reload changes. All code used in the demo of this project is open source and available to anyone.

welcome to our presentation thanks for

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,830
showing up to see what we've been up to

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,830
with Minecraft

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:21,349
children what could you start an area

00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:26,290
when you were so when I when I was young

00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:30,380
about 12 a friend of mine Bob's the

00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:34,460
computer an MSX computer like this one

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:38,390
okay and my first so that they booted up

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,550
and it was basically basic environment

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,010
so you you could type your own program

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:49,160
in there and the first program I did was

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:52,820
just a little bring my name right away I

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:58,730
was I was really caught by this I got in

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,600
the library and started programming that

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,100
sounds very familiar

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,050
that sounds very familiar I had an

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,909
almost identical experience on this

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:10,430
environment here that some of you might

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:11,600
remember what you're doing that this

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,450
environment here for those of you

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,280
remember very very similar right those

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,160
days it was different

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,630
there was no

00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,000
there's no I can hear to double-click on

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,840
to get up to YouTube exactly no apps to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,370
tab it was really simple and that's a

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,500
bit of the problem right now with kids

00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,570
if you want to learn how

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,040
lure them to program and you say okay

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,170
this little program can print your name

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,180
on the screen they're not really caught

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,880
by that anymore that's a little boring

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:49,560
right print hello world it's not getting

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:52,440
them anymore well my son went to this

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,990
deaf ox for kids once okay and they had

00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,640
Minecraft there oh that's a cool game

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,800
because playing that as well yeah

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,510
because that really kept against them

00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,270
because they they know this game and

00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,160
they played with it and and in circuits

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,100
they show them how to extend this game

00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,130
so but he could do is build a little

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,000
plugin that could he could change arrows

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,070
into cats

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,310
all right to throw cats on the air the

00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,020
exact school but then we came back and I

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,490
said okay let's do this more because it

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,320
was really cool I thought hey that's

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,090
cool I would like to see how that how's

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,500
that how it's done and then he said yeah

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,920
I don't know how to because you have to

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,040
install these things I had this Eclipse

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,300
workspace and all that stuff because a

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,600
Java API instead of Java instead of an

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,150
editor server the server

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,190
the workspace I need to compile these

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,520
things and companies jar files that's

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:52,640
all a bit much for kids right our super

00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,820
environment yeah turn it on and goes I

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,740
wonder if we could somehow get back to

00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,150
have an experience like that yeah what

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,860
do we need for that anything we need

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,200
something like a server running

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,330
somewhere yeah that easy way to set it

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,930
up that would be in one of the elements

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,640
right Sam way to run this in this case

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:21,140
this game server right just sort of

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:25,370
fired up and get on it and we have this

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,460
project it's called launch ok and it's

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,970
basically you show the website it's

00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,370
basically a website where you can get

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,820
going on openshift

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,510
reals I like I like where this is going

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,670
openshift

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,410
like this runtime environment we can get

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,600
free accounts to other applications and

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,280
run them on perhaps we could just run

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,710
our server there right that our kids

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,660
connect to that the way we made it it

00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,110
says we have like supported runtimes

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,360
here like swarm vertex and node and

00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,580
spring boot this all looks very serious

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,260
this is for work this for work but it's

00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,090
made in a way that you can also extend

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,020
it and add your own so at your own

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,900
examples to it

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,200
ooh this is why Monday to Friday at work

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,080
we can create new projects with one fly

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,890
vertex we can make Minecraft servers for

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,170
our kids sounds cool so we have this

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,570
server set up on our

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,640
local opportunities so we have a local

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,930
local open ships running on this on this

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:30,590
laptop it's just because we didn't trust

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:32,990
the Wi-Fi here you can use them right so

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,680
here you can say just wanna build and

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,900
deploy and run on this local machine

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,890
machine cluster and then you can sit you

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:47,000
can choose this out no JBoss snow vertex

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:49,520
for my craft there's a different kind of

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,560
API where you can build stuff on the

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:59,810
microf servers and sponge is one of them

00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:02,210
that's the best one you can say for plug

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,540
an example okay that will show you how

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:09,440
to do how to do how to do some extent

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:13,580
micro do some basic things okay and then

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,710
you choose your topic so it will create

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:22,960
a github repo for you with this example

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:26,000
code okay right application it will

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,890
create a github account add some web

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,870
hooks okay so that's when your code

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,030
changes the server gets restarted and

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,210
and and and Weavin bloated if your new

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,470
changes and it will set this all up an

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,300
overshift Wow

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,890
so you can sort of read one Plex setup

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,050
application you can get started an

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,300
example have it running in the cloud let

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:51,380
your friends connect to it yeah and this

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:54,830
is pretty faster but like a good chef we

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,090
here's one I prepared earlier we're

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,090
gonna say three minutes here of our

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,949
30-year we have with you yeah so let's

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,409
see oh this is the this is the

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:08,360
the kidnap repo that it created okay and

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:11,219
it has web hooks so if I would go here I

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,169
know she lost me here what so what are

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:16,439
we looking at here this is this is a

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:21,930
demo plug-in setup okay so here is a

00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:25,229
example of example code minecraft

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,530
extension so this is what a kid would to

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:31,460
be shown how to extend you could you

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,460
could go and play now

00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:39,930
it's time for some system so this is the

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,819
servants also booted up and run setup

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,800
for you so this one's on this laptop

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,870
inside our is already single node

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,139
cluster we have here in the container

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:59,610
and those of you who know minecraft it's

00:06:52,139 --> 00:07:05,550
a standard Minecraft world that's the

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:08,339
extension change the behavior of

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,129
Minecraft and whenever you collide so

00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,750
every whenever you jump it will print to

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,800
this point because this is going in the

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:19,610
chance yeah great okay so and that's

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,229
you're saying this is coming from year

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:25,620
it's an event listener and it has a

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:28,830
collides event handler and then when it

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,270
finds the player and says point okay so

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,669
walk me through this again so we have on

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,069
github an example project how to extend

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,080
minecraft bread which the open ships

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,599
launch you've created for us right and

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,330
this is running because how did this

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,120
actually do so

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,560
there's an s2 i the source to image kind

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,940
of a thing alright social mix is this

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,270
thing they have an opportunity right

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,340
from source to containers it's your bill

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,710
sis code and boots up at a server

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,509
running this running is plugging adding

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,960
explodes would so all I have to do to

00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:03,979
change this so if I'm a wanted to change

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,330
this I could just go here go to edit and

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,800
change bowing into something else so

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,490
like right on get on right on get up

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,639
check it and it will fired away and

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:19,440
reboot my server with built the plug-in

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,360
and the plug-in able to create a new

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,370
container image for processed why stuff

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,460
right it will stop the previous

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,500
container yeah deployment that replaces

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:33,300
the previous server gets the new one of

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,229
them right so disconnected with your

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,950
server boosters

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:41,669
alright the entire process is white yeah

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:44,579
I mean this is interesting and learn

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,800
about openshift it's it's ok but I have

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:55,200
a 10 year old daughter and she's like

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:59,190
way gone back to YouTube mean way to

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,020
reload code be nice you should actually

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,000
change in life or something yeah you

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,430
could change it and then build something

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,160
and then replaces so there's a couple of

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,810
things at least two sites to this right

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,250
you would need a way to change the code

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,770
somewhere more than there it's because

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,920
this whole get top committing rebuilding

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,980
so one dress that we could we could we

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:24,329
have something like a cliche okay which

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:27,180
is an IDE that runs in your browser so

00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:30,180
instead of installing eclipse on your

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,240
local machine we could run this also on

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,839
our honor

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,779
instance and now instead of having just

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,029
a little bit of fancy text editor here I

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:46,509
have now the same project see the same

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:49,809
project the same code I think it's just

00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:52,709
in text editor yeah it's um syntax

00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:56,139
highlighting oh c'mon here I have like

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:58,360
so that will help kids to find the right

00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,040
API to call and write things to do

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,600
hey this is lipstick it's really cool

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,100
and this one's an opportunity and it

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,100
runs on the same instance on the same

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,029
local today I solve one of those

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,970
problems and the other problem we have

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,649
to solve is replacing this code like

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,670
only someone built something on top of

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:20,889
folks yeah I kept being Java based and

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,879
so if you want a hot code replace things

00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,209
in Java there's a couple of options

00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:31,119
there and these Java JVM agents that you

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:34,059
can use to replace : there's limitations

00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:35,829
this OSGi thing isn't used that much in

00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,720
the industry for persona production

00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:39,189
isn't applications you might not want to

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:47,339
replace you're running code in

00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:50,750
production so so let's check so

00:10:47,339 --> 00:11:26,480
minecraft voice gee hi

00:10:50,750 --> 00:11:28,070
oh so you're saying you're saying okay

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,900
so now we've changed the source code

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,880
inside the chit container in the

00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,100
development right side let me get it

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,260
somehow we have to get it there so

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,930
there's a little maven plugin in this

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,660
project already installed that will make

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,630
a deep of your code okay send dance over

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:52,730
over WebSockets to this is a running

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:56,420
minecraft server right we'll compile the

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,400
code into an OSGi bundle and hot replace

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:06,920
this code you don't say this actually

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:11,510
works the demo gods allow it right so

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,350
just run this maven build inside

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,010
OpenShift

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:18,589
on our development in a side container

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,240
so we can just get our kids to extend

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,250
and add some things in here just by

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,290
going on this website yes nothing needs

00:12:22,250 --> 00:13:25,750
to be installed locally right

00:12:25,290 --> 00:13:27,160
okay okay and then in the world so I

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,310
think this works really well if you go

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,220
back over here this works really well if

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,200
this makes some sense to you or you can

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,840
sit together with your what would you

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,840
say I would say like yes to be like 12

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:51,310
to know all these Java constructs

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,260
there's a little bit of still write all

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,810
of these different AP Isis classes here

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,640
that you have some know how to semicolon

00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,680
braces and whatnot in the right places

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,720
and almost

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:06,329
well the syntax follows three kids read

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:08,629
like this it's cool right it's good I'm

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:15,139
just wondering if we can do better for

00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:18,329
the batch before sort of a 12 year olds

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:22,050
this is the home of MIT you're right

00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:24,230
we're in Boston this scratch develops

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,920
here anybody here does not know scratch

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,480
raise your hand if you don't know

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,300
scratch everybody knows press right

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,920
anybody know scratch scratch is a visual

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,449
development environment for children up

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,779
on scratch so they might be that are you

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:39,559
very well known it's been around for

00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,559
1213 something like this year's

00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:46,679
raspberry pie it's very widely very wide

00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:48,300
news and the cool thing with this is its

00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,089
visual development so instead of writing

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,410
this code that we have over here and the

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:53,819
point here is Venus Java code

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,889
administers five pin code will be the

00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:57,269
same thing the point is that for younger

00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,069
children to just be able to assemble

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:09,929
blocks

00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:11,429
much easier I think a minimum may be

00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:13,439
reading recognizing the blocks and you

00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:15,029
can get it started with yeah right so

00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:17,100
hang on what we're saying here is that

00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:17,879
will be interesting to be able to mod

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,120
'minecraft

00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,350
with scratch with scratch instead of

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,660
jo-jo that works because we are in a

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,670
winner container over here in openshift

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,370
okay we have this always GI stuff yeah

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,470
but we would we would we would have to

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:35,459
have some sort of so you can extend it

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:37,589
with JavaScript scratching the extent of

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,350
this JavaScript it's it's built in flesh

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,429
but you can extend it to JavaScript so

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,809
really the current version that's built

00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,459
in flash right there's a new version

00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,400
coming out for scratch free which is

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:49,350
completely written in JavaScript

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:55,710
and then you can also do it on your iPad

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:58,529
or a mobile okay and box in here

00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,150
right some additional blocks so if we

00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:02,880
would have something that would be

00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,500
JavaScript and Java that would be really

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,120
good so yeah because they probably still

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,380
have is that we're running even if we

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,690
had custom blowers like if you had a

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,310
custom block to maybe I don't know show

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,110
something in here or something of that

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,180
still need to bridge from what we're

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,310
running in the browser to back in the

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,200
backend with a micro service right so

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,520
something that allows us maybe a sort of

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,450
an instrument of message bus or

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:28,589
something to go from the something like

00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,940
route links vertex vertex is this other

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,170
Red Hat thing we're just talking about

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,170
most of these various things here so

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:40,500
that's a reactive Java framework that

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,790
has an event bus that you can also use

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:49,320
from JavaScript right because it's

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:51,330
distributed so let's see we could

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,760
actually we actually have something of

00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,430
us running right let's show that stuff

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,570
earlier so this is another server so I

00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,570
just need to quickly go out here

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:06,089
it's also running locally on our own

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,640
openshift instance we have to time maybe

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,770
a jumpy duo could you show me other sure

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,040
it is how we set it up we're doing on

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,839
time

00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,480
yeah yeah so what we could maybe just

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,559
show here is how on this local open

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,400
sheriff there's an instance here which

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,400
just timed me out

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:29,999
really security setup I'm a developer

00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:31,590
develop the launcher as Choudary are in

00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:34,970
two separate projects okay so this is

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,970
the container that runs this thing

00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:42,059
change a instance we have that's

00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:45,570
actually several containers at once this

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:48,539
is every every guy builds you do here

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:52,289
some separate container okay and then

00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,970
we've got test 38 which is our minecraft

00:17:52,289 --> 00:18:00,090
server right that's the launcher created

00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:03,359
this project and set it up to this one

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,159
just really so what it's showing us here

00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,159
is that we have an application minecraft

00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:11,340
server right and that application is

00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:13,289
running for click Alice has a deployment

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,509
it's the first deployment because we

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:16,559
just set up mm-hm and we can check out

00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:18,929
the locks here right

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,299
okay just the logs that's running from

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,629
the running minecraft server if they

00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,629
come up

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,350
demo love

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,889
it's loading looks so this is Steve oh

00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:35,659
here we go so this is actually the the

00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:37,549
logs of the minecraft server inside the

00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:42,739
container itself from the magnet from

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:44,419
the operative console you see the change

00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,429
for this is like this is the maven build

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,970
right right right when the hell of that

00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:51,820
one point became the hello what's over

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,070
here

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:58,279
so here it builds and they create they

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,399
create the image difference okay so the

00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:04,940
point of going from here initially yeah

00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:08,450
going from our our source code here

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:13,340
initially to container we stopped by the

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:16,840
pills that happens there's also you can

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,840
show maybe also there's an image

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,370
this is going yet there's go up until

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:26,920
the images the image is image here

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:28,960
that's to it is this like a registry

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:34,240
registry the container mature just read

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,850
its built-in torches okay well with that

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,220
we could look at our other project the

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,080
stories one here very similar very

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,750
simple I'm gonna use this opportunity as

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,400
a plug we actually have this running in

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,110
case anybody wants to continue checking

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,690
this out at home we actually have what

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,670
we're showing you here running on that

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:57,180
public server on a public open shift

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:57,180
instance so if you want to go to www.hsn

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,790
one it at home or god forbid help us

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,380
make it better

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,650
you can go check out the sources here

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,450
where everything we've done this make it

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:14,470
better or add some YouTube videos yes

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,820
welcome and there different ways to

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,500
contribute to open source right that's

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,500
not just the cold no you don't have to

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,720
code improve the documentation or make

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,250
the site better get make a video that

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,590
shows what you've done with this yeah

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,540
you're going to do it or get some issues

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,540
like what else do you want

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:37,480
so how does this work I have to connect

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,370
way system learned of studies yeah

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,400
that's the public one but we also have

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:47,590
it running locally yeah we don't want to

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,640
thrust their conference this one you got

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,000
the same thing when you connect to the

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,909
public

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,150
I became dark while we were talking here

00:20:53,909 --> 00:21:00,039
dr. Leung yes

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:02,380
so these minecraft worlds have a weather

00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:09,309
cycle in the daytime cycle who is this

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:10,630
that's right Vinnie our favorite so this

00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,580
is a standard micro servo where's the

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,190
bumbling that's good it's not from this

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,419
one this one is different this is the

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,419
one that we have to scratch intubation

00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:21,250
right okay so let's go back to this very

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:22,960
www dot line down study what are we

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,419
saying here yes

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,159
start by typing slash mating type slash

00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:31,690
make in the microchip again link

00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:33,970
subscribe so we can do slash make there

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,960
you go link click here to open scratch

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,960
and make actions

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,410
- this this

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,410
and you think we can go in here

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,620
so basically we're doing the same thing

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,710
but what like what we did before

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,750
okay we're creating a plugin or we're

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,710
extending minecraft but look like code

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,169
for fine

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:03,019
by adding scratch blocks using this

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:06,889
vertex event bus inclined to 270 so here

00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:10,279
we have like a normal scratch GUI it can

00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:13,039
do stuff like have events and have

00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:14,419
control blocks so everything other than

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,070
two more blocks is the standard schedule

00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,370
a but some children already familiar in

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,720
fact and we have the minecraft blocks

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:24,399
extra Mike reflects on the more blocks

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:29,899
so what do we have here maybe bigger

00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:33,799
control plus so the blocks that we have

00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:36,889
here there's one that says title we give

00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:42,169
this one you put it in here and let's

00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:44,360
use a scratch when space key is pressed

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:46,250
so this is the space key in scratch not

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,730
in minecraft just on this pattern so if

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:51,009
I press space here

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,139
it's gonna be fast I get out welcome

00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:58,869
over there you get my basically you get

00:22:53,139 --> 00:23:00,879
my first this is something with kids

00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:02,109
can't get excited about right right and

00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,879
this is really easy you don't need to

00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:05,379
set up servers right and what you just

00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:08,249
connect to this minecraft server type

00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:10,989
slash make and then use these blocks

00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:15,059
you're extending micros and you're

00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:15,059
extending my car do you think we can do

00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:21,730
I think you should do something of our

00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:23,919
favorite dunkey year let's let's um try

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,019
to do something creative more like

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,909
storytelling not like slaying zombies

00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:31,450
and counting points that's stupid right

00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:33,129
let's do something nice with um for

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,129
example we have a what am i holding here

00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:38,649
there are only a carrot carrot tell you

00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:40,389
what we'll make a custom command instead

00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:43,620
of pressing space and slash we'll build

00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:46,100
a custom command slash table

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,470
and there's an entity superblock here

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:54,420
why don't I try to make it Benny

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:56,800
say something well that's cool sleepy

00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:00,060
over here

00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,060
was going to

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:19,870
and because we have all the spots

00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:21,580
available here we could do more add some

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,200
logic to this okay

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,600
let's do something else what do we have

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,269
in here for maybe do it even better do

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:40,480
if else if then or if it's an else if

00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:44,019
then else let's go crazy if it a fun

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,080
story with the carrot and feed me feed

00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:49,510
feed the donkey kind of thing so why

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:55,750
don't we say if

00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:58,049
the item is held is equal to the visual

00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,049
nervous

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:05,850
now this is equal to two and a half ball

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,750
no do it carrots donkeys love carrots

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,550
long as you can okay so a little carrot

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:16,520
and let's change see how this comes to

00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,520
say this is this the donkey polite dog

00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:26,600
this is when you have occurs

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:32,880
right I'm sure kids would have gotten

00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,010
this right I'm totally confused if it's

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:42,930
a carrier then else with it please even

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:44,910
if we are to say thanks for yummy so

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,050
then he will say we could have three

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,300
characters also so we could have a

00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,670
dialogue here I didn't have any and his

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,860
friends and they can exchange comments

00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:59,310
or something on this we could hear

00:25:52,860 --> 00:26:02,670
thanks thanks for the carrot because

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:05,730
he's like like that great

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:11,490
so with this different here we say slash

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:15,050
down we're not holding the carrots and

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,050
if we use this minecraft

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,719
[Music]

00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:35,070
kids could feel the whole adventure

00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:38,820
adventure in inside minecraft thanks :

00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:40,800
yes some puzzles to solve puzzles

00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,410
riddles real stories or something to

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,820
like find some things you hold that you

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,220
can use the variables in in scratch

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,260
scratches this data blocks this is

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,000
basically variable so you could say if

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,340
you fund this before you said something

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,800
that true yeah it's too bad first

00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:06,810
complete the quest yeah we probably

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:09,120
talked configure all the things so with

00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,100
that we're sort of almost up in time and

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,250
have basically covered what we wanted to

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,470
show you guys if you have any questions

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,590
were happy to answer them and most

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,440
importantly try this out you can join

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,360
our server here

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,390
WW no they've learned on study hey you

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,370
wanted to show to the other and if some

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,070
mornings even have this is Jax over here

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:34,990
our kids told us that we're all on this

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,990
court we didn't know much about it but

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,310
if you wanna be cool yet to be on this

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,160
court channels over here that you can

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,470
like join us and say hi

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,800
and again the sources are linked down

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:51,170
here we also have got a link down here

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,220
for more cool sites this is nothing much

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,870
to do with Minecraft but we're just

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,000
using the opportunity of having you all

00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:00,380
here to showing you at the last link on

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,120
WWF study is a link to this little site

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,440
for educational YouTube channels and

00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,820
hardware things for robots and

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,260
microwaves and all these things that

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,020
some of you I'm not guessing a familiar

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,520
with and we have over over the last two

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,550
years or so I think we've collected some

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,380
recommended links here that our children

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:21,620
yeah and if you can think of think of

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,810
some things that we on this page and you

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,610
can make as well because of course this

00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:30,920
page is just a missing time here you

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,050
just click here and it sends pull

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:42,940
requests for how you other things you

00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:42,940
might thanks to interest

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:06,090
[Music]

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,090
but just to repeated

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,280
[Music]

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,280
like sir

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,369
[Music]

00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,690
is active to every use

00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,640
[Music]

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,040
are these commands for everybody on the

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,440
server right and that's actually very

00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,100
much what we were working on like half

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,810
an hour ago before the presentation

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,510
correctly this project is in the browser

00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:47,900
and you can save it locally so this save

00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,640
basically opens a file chooser and puts

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,290
a zip file on your local thing and we've

00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,270
just started chatting together how we're

00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,980
actually gonna save the project that you

00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,030
have here which is a JSON file in

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,040
scratch

00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:00,770
we're gonna push it to the server so

00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,150
save these together with the worlds

00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,410
because that's where they belong this

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,430
goes very much together with what you've

00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:09,830
created in Minecraft

00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:10,970
yeah dunkey this links technically

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,700
thinks that are in the world so I'm

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,660
gonna save these projects on the server

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,800
we're not quite there and we finish that

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,859
yet but we've pretty much

00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,859
[Music]

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,590
right now it's for every user as long as

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,600
you have those open so if you were to

00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,150
join the server right now this would

00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,090
work for you but it's running in the

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:40,640
browser so if we close this tab won't be

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,500
active for you anymore and so something

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,450
we wanted to do as a follow-up to when

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,780
we have this push to the server when we

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:51,049
have this saved in on the server

00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,450
basically so in scratch-free

00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:55,700
the whole logic is kind of changed and

00:30:53,450 --> 00:31:00,650
this is just like a separate thing where

00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:04,490
you can parse the scratch file and save

00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:06,049
it also as a JSON file so we can run it

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,630
on the server sort of this whole parsing

00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:10,400
and logic on the server and then we can

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,380
save it easily so that the cunning plan

00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,480
is to move this to scratch three you

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,980
know says the Java Script tastes very

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,900
much of your architecture where they

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:29,419
have what they call it the scratch it's

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:31,400
based on there's a stretch VN that's

00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:32,929
basically the whole parsing running the

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,270
running scripts especially amidst an

00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:37,700
envoy the dunk we part that we will then

00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,880
also run a note on the server right and

00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,320
then there's a GUI GUI part that we'll

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,330
do this and we'll change it a bit

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,490
because here is there's this preview

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,470
window or there there's this preview

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,450
window there

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,070
we don't need that so we could change

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:56,120
that coach and we have more space to

00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,940
push the person to the server and then

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,350
in Safari use the scratch vm project and

00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,910
running in some node container or

00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:12,870
something there are another constant

00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:12,870
thank you just go for it

00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,779
yeah

00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:24,710
so this one here and this is easy to

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:28,040
find just yeah that's right here it is

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,450
here couple of things it's easy to find

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,230
don't don't write down the URL of this

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,230
just go to the minecraft page London

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:49,130
study and then down here we get to this

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:52,970
from here any other questions I know

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,620
where between you in the break we're
