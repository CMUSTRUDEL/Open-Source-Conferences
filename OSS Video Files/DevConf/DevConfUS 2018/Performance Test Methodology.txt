Description: 
	Performance test needs scientific and precise methodology to drive the test.
How to design a scientific and precise methodology to measure performance? That's what I'd like to share in this session.
I'm working on a performance test project - xperf. This project will design a fresh new methodology on how to do performance test, how to analysis result data, and how to get a reasonable and scientific performance result. Just running a iperf/netperf and get result from their final output isn't scientific and precise. xperf will totally change this kind of performance test methodology. I'd like to share this project in this session. More about xperf can be found from https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/display/~xiaofwan/xperf.
