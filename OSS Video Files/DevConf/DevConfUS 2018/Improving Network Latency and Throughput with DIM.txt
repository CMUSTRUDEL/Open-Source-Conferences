Description: 
	Dynamic Interrupt Moderation (DIM) refers to changing the
interrupt moderation configuration receive queue in order to optimize packet
processing. The mechanism includes an algorithm which decides if and how to change moderation parameters for a receive queue, usually by performing an analysis on runtime data sampled from the system.

One of the primary benefits of DIM is that a default interrupt coalescing timer can be optimized for low-latency, but as the volume of traffic on a receive queue increases the interrupt timer automatically adjusts to increase CPU efficiency when high-throughput traffic is encountered. Conversely the interrupt timer will adjust back to lower levels when measurements show that the traffic on a receive queue is lower bandwidth again.
