nice and sweet from the pineapple and

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,600

non-alcoholic one and i'll take the rest

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,799
coffee and ginger

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,840
it goes quite good together so let's

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
make it

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,769
[Music]

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,120
from the mystery box i have chosen two

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
special ingredients just pineapple and

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,239
coconut milk

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,120
i was thinking about some like frozen

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,800
pina colada but let's uh make it a

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,519
little better

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,120
i will call the cocktail pineapple fire

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,160
and ice

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,920
and in a minute you will see why

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,599
let's start by cutting the pineapple

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,200
which will make the cocktail

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,400
fruity and thick

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,200
if you use the pineapple juice just put

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
as much as you like

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,760
with the frozen cocktails which are the

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,680
ones

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,680
who we mix with the ice

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
like frozen margaritas for example for

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,959
frozen bakeries

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
the thing is you should put much more

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,760
flavor in it

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,480
so let's make it more sweet more sour

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,440
and when you mix it with the ice the

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
water

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,000
dilutes the flavors and it's

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,840
come up just the way you want it so with

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,319
the pineapple we want to put

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,720
some lemon juice

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,680
as i said earlier put a little bit more

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,680
than you would normally

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,640
the coconut milk is kind of thick which

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,519
is good

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,319
and i will put a little piece of ginger

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,860
as well

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,929
to make it tingy and little spicy

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,929
[Music]

00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,319
the sugar i'm about to use i will

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,920
put some powdered sugar for the same

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,640
reason uh i put it more of it because we

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,159
mix it with the ice and it's gonna

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,000
dilute a little bit

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,000
so the powder sugar is gonna be a bit

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
better

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,880
[Music]

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,479
with the spices i think i'm gonna

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,280
put star anise

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:36,720
some cloth and as a final touch

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,560
some cinnamon so we have

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,720
sugar lemon pineapple ginger

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,800
of course it's missing rum but in this

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,199
session we do non-alcoholic

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,199
drinks

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,160
[Music]

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,000
the ice we're gonna use uh i would

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,479
definitely put some crushed ice because

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,880
when you want to mix it with the blender

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,880
the big cubes would be too big

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:11,840
let's crush the eyes

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,120
[Music]

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,160
and for this amount of ingredients

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,639
i would use

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:39,840
let's say this much of the crushed one

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:39,840
so you don't need

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:53,840
so let's mix it up

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,899
[Music]

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,199
let's put a pinch of salt some little

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
bit more of the coconut milk and a touch

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,440
of pineapple juice as well because it's

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
very thick

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,199
[Music]

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,319
here we go

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,560
[Music]

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,160
and i have forgotten to put the spices

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:35,840
in there so let's put the cloth and the

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,840
star on it as well

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,360
so the summer is around the corner

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,840
so the frozen drinks are going to be

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
the best option

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:09,039
i will serve it in a tall glass

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,039
don't forget the straws because

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:20,319
and as a garnish let's put a

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
slice of pineapple

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,759
to start onions as i said earlier

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,880
and a little surprise

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,160
to make your friends

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,520
a little jealous about your skills

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
i will use the fire

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,840
and some cinnamon so enjoy a cocktail

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:59,840
[Music]

00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
do

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:15,599
[Music]

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,960
what's up y'all i'm gonna make you

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:23,039
non-alcoholic gin and tonic so

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,759
let's get started take some container

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,319
at home you can use a pot or something

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
now we're gonna add some spice make it

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,680
nice

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,680
you know what i'm saying so about five

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:47,040
really cloves christmas

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,920
all bad boy so

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
one star needs

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
cinnamon about this size

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,480
and then you add some water

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440
50 ml of this beauty

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,760
[Music]

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,040
that's it we have to heat it up

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,760
because we need the flavor from the

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
spices

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,519
released into the water and you will

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
find out

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,880
that it's done the water will be brown

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:37,839
little bit brown

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:37,839
let's heat it up

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,440
i think it's done now we have to cool

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,800
this up

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,800
cool it down baby

00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,320
so what we need is a strainer

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:05,600
strain it remove the spices

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:19,200
we don't want them in our cocktails

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:23,200
dump it and now we're gonna cool it

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
don't do this at home guys i'm a

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
professional

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,800
just use your fridge or something so

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:47,839
[Music]

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,839
take your glass pour the mixture in

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,920
now add about a teaspoon

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,320
[Music]

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,320
of custard sugar what

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,720
then we need some sour part

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:10,079
[Music]

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,079
so one half a lemon

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,839
squeeze it

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,919
[Music]

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,760
i would say 10 mil

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:45,040
i'm gonna add ice

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,040
take a tonic

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:57,600
open it otherwise it's not going to work

00:11:49,279 --> 00:12:00,720
now pour it gently

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,680
take a spoon the other side

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,320
and gently mix it together we want to

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,360
keep bubbles in there

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
we don't want it flat

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,200
yeah everything is all together

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,519
now i'm gonna garnish to make it even

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,519
better

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,839
two slices

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:41,279
and a final touch ground black pepper

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:52,960
and here we go your non-alcoholic

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:59,680
gt enjoy

00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:04,160
[Music]

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:08,800
oilat so my drink

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,760
consists of coffee and ginger

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,639
the idea behind the drink is to make a

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
let's say

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,880
one sip short drink

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,000
in the morning coffee

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,920
for to keep you awake in the day

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,399
and the ginger to keep you healthy

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,839
especially in this situation around here

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,839
so first of all i'll spray the ginger

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:48,130
just this kind of piece

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:51,250
with the suspicion

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,250
[Music]

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,440
oh that might be enough

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,870
so i'll take the jar because i'll shake

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,950
the drink

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,950
[Music]

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,720
the jars put the

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,720
ginger in it
