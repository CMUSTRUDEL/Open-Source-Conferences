then i show you uh how to brew it in a

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,200
clever dripper

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,479
and then there is a space for your

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
questions

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,759
uh today and tomorrow this section will

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,479

tasting another coffee and another

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,320
brewing method

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,200
uh as a first i chose coffee el poste

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
it's a farm located at the north of

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
nicaragua

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,600
and it's owned by montenegro family and

00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,479
we didn't choose this coffee by accident

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,520
the montenegro family has really strong

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,600
story

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,360
behind it and as you may maybe uh know

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,239
in november there was two

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
heavy hurricanes which hit the central

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
america

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,879
which was followed by flocks and

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,440
landslides

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:25,280
so our friend benjamin from honduras

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,560
are he's doing uh fundraising for

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,840
rebuilding and uh relocating

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,720
homes of coffee farms families so

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
we put this coffee into the donation

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
edition

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,200
so this uh charity edition coffee and we

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,920
already raised about 5 000

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,840
us dollars for this fundraising thanks

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,200
to you and thanks to our customers

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,239
so thank you well

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,080
uh the story of montenegro family as i

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,800
said is really strong because

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680
over the past 20 years they almost lost

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,959
the farm

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,800
three times first

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,640
they were also hit by hurricanes

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,760
then followed by a financial crisis

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,080
and when they overcome this

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,120
these stranges they

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
have to cut all the coffee trees because

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,519
they were

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
affected by arroya well it is a

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,799
coffee fungus which attacks the coffee

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,400
plants and they

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:34,959
almost like die so

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,519
but uh to be to be uh

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,440
to be positive the coffee is tasting

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,720
really great from this uh

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,840
from this family and they have their

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,680
farm is about

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,120
60 hectares and half of it is

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,799
planted by coffee a second part is

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,040
planted by tomatoes so off-season

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
of coffee season they produce also the

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
ketchup

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
the coffee you are tasting today it's a

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,400
washed uh katura

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,400
which was harvested last march and it

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,599
was processed by washed process

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,200
what means the coffee cherry was pulped

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,599
and then the coffee beans were fermented

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,400
over

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,199
40 hours in fermentation tanks then

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,639
coffee was

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,120
washed in a water channel and then dried

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
on

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,479
raised african beds so this process

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,080
gives the coffee really

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:36,320
bright fruitiness of yellow fruits

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:40,320
it has really nice maple syrup

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,960
sweetness and i really like about this

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,120
coffee

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,680
the hairball finish of a lime balm

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,320
so maybe let's start with the brewing i

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,000
show you

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
the coffee dripper this clever draper is

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,400
really

00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:00,400
simple and a clever device it

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,680
combines simplicity of french press

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,280
and coffee clarity of

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,720
filtered coffee so

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,520
first of all i boil the water and rinse

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
the paper filter

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:23,680
to preheat

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,800
the brewer and also rinse the paper

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,080
filter through

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,199
the paper paper test

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,199
i discard the vulture

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:45,039
and then i add 30 ml

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,039
of water which is of boil

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,840
sorry 300 milliliters i'm using scale

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
to be exact

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,840
then i add 20 grams of

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
coffee

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:15,600
and mix it properly

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,440
so all grounds are saturated by water

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,319
and let it steep for two minutes

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
maybe you are curious why i'm adding

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,199
water first

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,680
and coffee second

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,960
usually this you brew it you put coffee

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,919
first then water

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,720
but sometimes it happened to us that the

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,800
filter

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
a coffee filter no paper filter get

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,919
clogged and coffee stop

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,600
drawing so we developed this technique

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,960
to make it more

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,120
efficient and faster

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,199
a grind size that you're using the grain

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
size is uh it's called a medium grind

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,039
size

00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,400
and i

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,440
it's it's like granulated sugar

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,080
you know you know it's uh uh

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,800
it's not cold and it's not super fine

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,800
okay yeah yeah

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,720
yeah so

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
you can also put lid on top to keep the

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,919
temperature

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,919
uh not cooling down so fast

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
your your brewing method in this it

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
keeps the coffee immersed

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,000
in so it's yes it's it's immersion i'm

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,039
using a french press and so it

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,319
kind of feels the same way okay yes it's

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,440
it's immersion brewer so it's it's

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
almost the same

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,160
uh like french press but there is a

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,360
small uh valve on the bottom

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,960
and when we put it on

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,000
on a mug the the valve is released

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,960
and coffee starts drawing down

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,440
through the paper filter so it's more

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
clear

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,720
there is a more clarity than in french

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,440
press there is a no

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
uh coffee coffee dust in your mug

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,639
so after two minutes i break the crust

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,639
and mix the coffee again

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,720
and let it steep for another one minute

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,280
well this this coffee method for me it's

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,080
one of my favorite because it's really

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,560
simple

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,760
usually i i put the water coffee in

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,200
go brush my teeth and after that i just

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
put it on my mug

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,240
and the coffee is ready so it's not not

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,440
complicated to prepare it and i

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,519
also really like to give it as a gift to

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,320
my friends because i know

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,600
they will use it and it will be it it's

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,839
not forgotten in

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,839
your in your kitchen anywhere

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,880
so and after the minute i just

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,800
put it on the mug and starts draining it

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
takes about 30 seconds

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,959
so it's really fast because one of the

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,080
questions that we got was

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,160
um around the draw time so is

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,839
are you able to control the draw time or

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,720
is it is it just gravity fed and it'll

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,959
drain

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,080
you can maybe slightly control it by

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,320
grind size

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
but

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,880
the important thing is to

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:41,200
not have the coffee so fine

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,200
so the paper filter didn't get clogged

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,399
yeah waiting on the coffee to draw

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,320
common david has asked also a question

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,320
here are there common mistakes people do

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,240
during filtered coffee preparation

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,080
um that you would want people to stop

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,920
doing like things that you've seen

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,720
or tips and tricks here well

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
the minute many questions are about how

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
many coffee

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,959
how much coffee to use and how much

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,279
water to use

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:14,480
and there is a simple simple recipe

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,760
you have to use 60 grams of coffee

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,880
for one liter of water so that's the

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,000
basic recipe

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,600
when you start uh

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
start with yeah

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,760
off my french press because it hit

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,519
finished while you were you were drawing

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,480
down your dripper

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,000
and the coffee is ready as you can see

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,000
it's really fast and easy

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
does the clever come in a larger size if

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,519
you wanted to make two cups

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
i'm not trying to sell the clever yeah

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,560
there is another in many sizes

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,640
uh i have a at home also like a small

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,880
single cup 200 milliliters

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
this is about 400 milliliters and i

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,360
think they have also like

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,480
600 milliliters so uh

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,600
yeah there is a uh

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,440
there are many options uh to share your

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,600
coffee as well

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,480
cool sorry i got kicked out by accident

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,079
from the software

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,120
apparently i shouldn't ask questions

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
about clever drippers

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,279
well maybe i can introduce

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,000
how we source maybe go to coffee because

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,440
uh

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,480
we celebrated last year 10 10

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,680
years anniversary and

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
uh maybe people are not familiar with

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
the term

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,480
of uh specialty coffee basically

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,240
specialty coffee

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,680
is you have a range from 0 to

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,880
100 points when the coffee

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,000
is uh above 80 80 points it can be

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,440
called as a specialty

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
coffee uh from whole world coffee

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,079
production it's about

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,160
five percent so it's a really

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,839
slight amount of the best you can you

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,680
can taste

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,560
and and we are really focused

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,360
on long-term partnerships with our

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,200
producers

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,399
so they are uh coffee farmers we work

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,440
uh with uh them like 10 years

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
for example carlos you will be tasting

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,639
tomorrow

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,839
so with this guy we we

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,959
are working from the very beginning

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,000
so for us it's really important to to

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,120
have those

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,639
uh long-term partnerships and

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,440
um yeah this this this way of

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,800
uh buying coffee is called also like

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
direct rate

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,480
where is really important the

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,120
transparency so

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,720
you you know about the coffee the coffee

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,639
variety

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,480
the coffee processing when the coffee

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,920
was harvested

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,560
where and who who are the people behind

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,240
the coffee

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,240
that's that's really important to us

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,200
that's really nice to know so the rest

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,040
of the coffee is i'll say just bulk

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,880
bought and then becomes

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
the the rest of the the coffee that we

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,760
run into in the universe on the center

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,800
um one of the questions that i had for

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,920
you uh

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,440
was on your website this is one of your

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
coffees that you categorized i believe

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
is a filter coffee and you've got

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
other coffees that you call espresso

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
coffees and i was curious

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,079
what is like the difference like if i

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
use the espresso coffee in my french

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,120
press is the universe going to collapse

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,760
or something

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
no no it will be not collapsed but uh

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,040
the

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
we uh

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
the difference between espresso roast

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,880
and roast for filter coffee

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,720
is that espresso roast coffee is a

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,760
little bit darker

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,639
so the coffee is more soluble because

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
you have

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,800
you need to extract uh

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,680
the coffee in less uh

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
less amount of time so in espresso you

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,639
have

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,480
30 seconds to extract it in brewed

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,600
coffee you have a four minutes

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,560
so that's the the that's the

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
difference between those categories of

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,160
the coffee

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,040
but if you put it as a french press it

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
can be just

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
a little bit like a darker darker

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
flavors in your coffee little maybe a

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,800
little bit

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,240
roasty as we call it but the universe

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,880
will be not collapsed

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,760
so um in our our last uh moments here i

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,120
know we've got about

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,880
i think it's about five or ten minutes

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,000
left in this part uh

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,839
do you want to walk us through what we

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
should be tasting if we're tasting this

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,240
coffee or is there a way that we should

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,839
taste

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
coffee from the cup in order to try and

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
get the full body of the coffee in our

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,120
mouth

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,440
yeah there is a way we call it like um

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,600
the coffee is tasting like a cupping we

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
use like a large spoon

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,920
and maybe and

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,199
you like do this it's

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,639
it's really loud but uh you can

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,680
like hit all the flavor or your flavor

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,440
palette in your mouth

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,440
so you can taste

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,880
the best from the coffee

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,600
you know because because your taste is

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,440
uh

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,560
mostly based on your uh

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,519
nose like smell yeah

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,959
so it's in your mouth it's connected and

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,399
what stands out for you from this

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,279
coffee's flavors

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,880
when you taste it once again uh what

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,639
kind of flavors are you experiencing

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
from this coffee

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,880
well

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,880
definitely a cycle as i said it's yellow

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,839
fruits like

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,839
uh apricots uh

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,839
the sweetness is like maple syrup with

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,120
the pecan nuts

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,680
you know you know those uh pastry pecan

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,959
nuts and

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:12,560
maple syrup it tastes like this

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:16,000
and slightly a horrible finish

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,680
uh like uh i think i

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,880
think it's called lime balm

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,560
it's i'm not sure i know that but then i

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,600
don't know all of my herbs i will

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,639
i will freely confess it's a herb

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,160
which tastes a little bit like uh lemon

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,000
limes

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,120
uh yeah usually my grand

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,240
grandma uh uses for tea

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,240
when we were sick so

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,279
so so it's a health coffee um

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,120
yes definitely coffee is healthy but i

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
know from from looking at our chat here

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,240
we we've gotten some folks who've joined

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
us from the west coast of the united

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
states this

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,040
this early in their morning so at least

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,880
one of them's already on his second pot

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,079
of coffee so hopefully this medicinal

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
coffee if you will will

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,919
will help him because he he got the el

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,959
posta as well

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,319
um cool cool if you wanted to set us up

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,039
for something to think about

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,520
uh for preparing coffee tomorrow whether

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,360
it's

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,039
the uh columbia and bacha that we're

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,120
going to do together with tereza

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,199
or just in general what advice would you

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,000
give somebody to maybe change their prep

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,240
for tomorrow morning

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,839
uh once again what advice would you give

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
somebody if they wanted to make a simple

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,120
change in how they approach their coffee

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
tomorrow

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,760
to you know move their life forward a

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,760
little bit more in coffee

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,799
well

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,880
maybe filter your water because

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
the the water is really important for

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,160
brewing coffee

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,280
because it's like 99

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,960
of your cup of coffee so

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,400
i usually use the uh the home

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,160
filtration kettle uh usually

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,559
britta bvt so it really improves

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,160
uh taste of your coffee and also the

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,520
taste of your tea

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,679
okay that's that that's maybe underrated

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
uh part of the coffee it's funny i did

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,280
that several years ago here

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,039
i live in brno the best city in the

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,880
czech republic and um

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,160
unfortunately we have a lot of calcium

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
in our water here

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,320
um because again we're best city in the

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,559
czech republic we're taking it to 10.

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
but uh i use a britta to filter my water

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,440
and it has actually improved the coffee

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,600
and the the tea greatly in our house yes

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,840
yeah and in bernoulli there is a really

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,000
hard water

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,120
yeah and also maybe

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
uh for grinding coffee to use

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,160
the burr grinder not not the video

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,520
blades but with the burr

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,180
so it produce much more

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,200
much more

00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,320
[Music]

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,640
uh even i think it's the word you look

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,400
yeah

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,640
everything is the same particles are a

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,200
little the same

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,360
when you are grinding on uh on the

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,120
blades it's depend on time

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,160
it you you spend uh

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,679
with the video right here um and

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,280
i just noticed we had a question from

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
manuel and i apologize i missed it

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,679
earlier

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,240
um they were asking about the clever

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
dripper um what's the rough diameter of

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
the cup

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
that you use with that because they were

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
i think they're thinking about getting

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,000
one and they want to make sure if it's

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
their favorite coffee mug

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,400
with the cup at the bottom what's the

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,600
diameter

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,600
the bottom the diameter

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
uh well uh i don't know what's in

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,039
diameter but

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,640
it almost fits on on all the uh

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:57,840
only max i have at home so it's really

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
it's really white so you can put small

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,520
cup

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,559
larger cup so it really doesn't depends

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,640
on

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,679
oh cool okay and these uh clever dripper

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,960
you can use uh the most widely spread

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,159
coffee filters which is

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,880
a size four and you can find them

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,440
almost in every and in every shop with

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
the home

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,840
a home uh home equipment

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:27,200
but i usually recommend to use

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,760
uh the ones we have also on our eshop or

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,320
it's from uh netherlands because they

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,400
have they

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:38,400
are flavor neutral so there is

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,200
no uh paper paper taste in your coffee

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,679
um yeah so we we've had another question

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,559
which is

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,600
is the clever dripper like a c70 and i'm

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,720
not sure what a c70 is

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,200
i don't know what is c70 uh i i know c7

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,120
is

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,320
uh is a well i don't know what the z

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
cs70 is i'm sorry

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,600
must be some wacky california thing we

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,720
have a wii 60

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,799
which is uh another uh really popular uh

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,159
coffee brewer from japan and

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,120
it looks really similar yeah it looks

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,240
really similar

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,679
to c70 as my colleague showed me

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,720
so it's uh the the biggest difference

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,840
is in the valve so you can see maybe

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,840
if we zoom it

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,200
there is a small valve which opens

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
and close

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,400
so it's not uh

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
the gravity is not here the the main

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,480
thing uh in

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
like in a poorer coffee uh-huh and and

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
phil has also clarified it looks like

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,240
you saw the same thing that the

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,520
the v60 and the c70 are very similar so

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,520
the valve

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,559
there is a maybe slightly different in a

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,159
shape

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,240
and in uh you know diameter of the hole

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,880
on the bottom of the broker

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,720
cool so um i'll bring us to a close with

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,360
a request of you and a request of our

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,200
audience

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,799
um to our audience i ask you post

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
pictures of your coffee experience

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,919

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,679
to brew it what did you brew if you

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
didn't brew the el posta with us put

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,159
those on

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,559
uh twitter your favorite social medias

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,200
et cetera please tag devconf perhaps

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,919
it'll show up in the next daily review

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,480
also um to you i would ask we had a

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,559
question

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,320
in the chat about whether teresa would

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,480
be willing to show us something

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,080
both with a dripper style or a filter

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,799
style but also maybe something like an

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
aeropress

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,200
so perhaps you could talk to your

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,640
colleague and see if that's something

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,799
that's an option for her

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,799
um and if she can that'd be great yeah

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,159
definitely we can figure it out for you

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,919
