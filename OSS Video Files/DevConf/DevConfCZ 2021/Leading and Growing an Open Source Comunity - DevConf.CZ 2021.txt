	Speaker: Sayak Sakar



This presentation targets an audience of advanced practitioners - learners who are already contributing to an open-source community in a leadership position and want to be able to lead and grow the community more effectively.

These learners may be asking questions like:
- Why do people choose to lead open source projects and communities?
- What's the difference between participating in and leading a project?
- How can I ensure a community grows sustainably?
- How can I spread the word about this project or community?
- What type of a leadership structure does a community require?

This presentation is best for audiences who want to develop a "long-term vision" for their open source community but might not know how to begin. At the conclusion of this experience, participants will be able to:
- Describe key differences between community participation and community leadership
- Recognize challenges that new community leaders can face
- Identify strategies for both increasing and sustaining community participation
- Understand how to measure the success of community involvement and how to communicate that success to others
