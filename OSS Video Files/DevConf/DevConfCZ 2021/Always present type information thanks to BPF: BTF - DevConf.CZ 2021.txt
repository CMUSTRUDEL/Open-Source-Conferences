Title: Always present type information thanks to BPF: BTF - DevConf.CZ 2021

	Speaker: Arnaldo Melo


The presence of compact type information brought initially by the needs of BPF allows for more and more tools to use it seamlessly.

This talk will show what has been accomplished so far in the BTF (BPF Type
Information) camp, from improvements in its generation from DWARF, overcoming compiler bugs and speeding up the tool used to encode the kernel BTF information, pahole.

The kernel now has all its types always available at /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux
and at devconf.cz 2021 time all its modules will be in that sysfs hierarchy
with the advent of split BTF.

The new raw pretty printing features of pahole will be demonstrated, where
things like raw arrays of structs can be fed to it plus the type name to use in
decoding stdin, all sorts of heuristics and back references are used to grok
complex data files.

The kernel also now have snprintf routines that use BTF for use in debugging
and tracing, bpftrace and bpftool use it and examples of such usage will be
shown.
