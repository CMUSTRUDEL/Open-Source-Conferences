	Speaker: Ondřej Míchal



Operating systems like Fedora Silverblue, Fedora CoreOS, and many others that use OSTree or other technologies are on the rise. While solving many problems, they introduce their own set. Few of them are tackled by Toolbox, a tool for creating an interactive container-based environment.

This talk will show how Toolbox operates, how it can be used for software development and software debugging (both through command-line and GUI apps), how a toolbox-based workflow can be useful even on "classic" Linux distributions, what were the recent accomplished milestones, and what are the plans for the future development of the tool.

While knowledge of containers is very helpful to understand all concepts around Toolbox, they are not required.
