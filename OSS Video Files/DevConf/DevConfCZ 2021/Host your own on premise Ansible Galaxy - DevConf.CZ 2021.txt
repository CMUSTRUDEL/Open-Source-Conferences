Title: Host your own on premise Ansible Galaxy - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-12
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: Brian Bouterse

This workshop will demo and help you setup an on-premise software for storing, syncing, and distributing Ansible Collection and Role content. This is analogous to an on-premise version of galaxy.ansible.com. To get up and running quickly, we’ll be using a pre-built container with pulp_ansible (https://pulp-ansible.readthedocs.io/) and (https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng/).

We will demonstrate:
- Creating one or more repositories to store Collections and Roles
- Installing Role and Collection content using the `ansible-galaxy` CLI client from these repositories
- Synchronizing Collections and Roles from galaxy.ansible.com
- Uploading Collection content via `ansible-galaxy` CLI
- Copying Collections and Roles between multiple repositories, simulating dev → staging → production environments
- Perform these operations using a great UI, whenever possible, and APIs otherwise

To participate, all that is needed is the ability to run one container.
