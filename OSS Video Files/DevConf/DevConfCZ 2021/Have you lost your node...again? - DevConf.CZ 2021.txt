	Speaker: Petr Horáček


Remote configuration of networking is a risky business. After you hit enter to set up your elaborate network, hopefully you will see the prompt blinking again after a couple of seconds of connectivity loss. But chances are, you won't get to see it ever again.

During this presentation we are going to discuss the resiliency of Kubernetes clusters and the risks of network configuration performed on day-2. We will follow by presenting Kubernetes nmstate, a tool for declarative cluster network configuration, and the mechanisms it uses to prevent and recover from connectivity loss.

The attendees should have at least a basic knowledge about Kubernetes.

The audience will walk away with a better understanding of the risks related to the configuration of the network of a Kubernetes cluster, and their mitigations.
