Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speakers: Gabriel Becker, Vojtech Polasek



Do you want to automate security compliance to comply with not only industry standard security standards, but also to adhere to your organization’s specific security policies? In this workshop, you’ll learn how OpenSCAP and ComplianceAsCode project can help you to automate security compliance. You will:
- Learn about the ComplianceAsCode project to build security content from the source.
- Learn the basics of automated security scanning and remediations using OpenSCAP security scanner.
- Customize provided existing security content using SCAP Workbench.
- Create your own security policy from scratch.
- Learn about the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) to write automated configurable security checks.
- Learn how to use Ansible with the ComplianceAsCode project to generate Ansible playbooks.

Note: This workshop is a self-paced lab with short introduction and instructor assistance.

welcome everyone uh my name is gabriel

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,320
becker i'm a software engineer at

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,639
uh red hat and i'm part of the

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,599
platform security compliance team mostly

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,440
for uh

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,440
rel and uh and here with my colleague

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,920
hello my name is uh voytic palacio i'm

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:31,039
also part of the same team ms gabriel

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,640
yeah so what is this workshop

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:38,320
so first we are going to give you uh

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,320
an introduction uh on some concepts for

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,879
secured compliance what is it about

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,520
explain some some of the details and

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,079
some of

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,360
the motivations behind all these uh

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
projects

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,039
and uh and then we'll talk about

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,399
uh a little bit about the project itself

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,800
the compliances code

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
and all the tools that compose this

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,159
ecosystem

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,200
and later i will give you some

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
details about the the workshop uh what

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,760
kind of exercises you'll be

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,920
going through and uh

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,159
what kind of uh things you'll be

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
learning from this workshop

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
and uh in the final part there will be

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,680
some

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,200
technical instructions and practical

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,520
considerations about this workshop

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,520
so now i give the word to voitier

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,759
okay thank you so once again welcome

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
everyone

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
and as you can see in the name this

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,119
workshop is going

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
to be about uh security compliance a lot

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,759
you will

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
you will and and the content which will

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,000
help you with in security compliance

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,680
and you will hear the word security

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,560
compliance a lot in this workshop so i

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,320
think it's

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,719
a good idea to say something about some

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,840
basic terminology

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,759
so let's start like with the word

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,239
compliance so compliance

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,479
it means that something is

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
aligned according to some security

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,879
policy or like

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,640
according to some standard uh i don't

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,720
know let's say that your phone

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
should be ip68 compliance which means

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
that it should withstand some harsh

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
conditions water and stuff like that

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,440
so it's compliance and the security

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,760
compliance is

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,319
uh compliance in a security let's say

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,920
frame like framed within the security

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,840
area

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,879
uh it's actually quite a large uh

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,239
large area of things you can have for

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,800
example

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
compliant door to your server room yeah

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,440
you can you can have a

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,959
that so that they can withstand the fire

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
you can have a

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,080
compliant reporting you can you can be

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,519
have like some legal in in security

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,640
compliance

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
so like it's quite wide area but part of

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
it

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
is also compliance of your computer

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,440
systems

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
and especially their configuration and

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
that's uh

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
that's what we are going to talk about

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,120
in this workshop

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,360
so how does it work like usually

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
let's say that you're a bank or like

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,319
some financial

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,760
finance processing company and

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,760
there exists some standards which you

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,959
should fulfill you should be compliant

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,480
with as a financial organization

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,000
so how does it usually work is that

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,720
there is some there is something called

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,680
policy it's usually some document

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,200
it can have many many requirements

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
including as i said legal

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
and like physical security and stuff

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,519
like that but uh

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
also it has some requirements for uh

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
systems

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,400
config configuration computer systems

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,439
and someone has to go through that and

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
like configure

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,879
systems configure systems

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
and then check it and then they can

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,560
pronounce themselves

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
yes we are compliant for example with

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
pci dss which is

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
exactly the policy for payment payment

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,439
industry

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,200
and this can be actually quite tedious

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
and long because these policies can have

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
hundreds of requirements and when you

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,519
have hundreds of servers and hundreds of

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
requirements this

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
can take a long time it can be error

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,280
prone

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
so that's uh where there comes an

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,800
automation

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,520
to help you to achieve this so next

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,639
slide please

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,960
uh automating security compliance and

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,120
i want to stress that i'm talking really

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,840
about compliance of your computer

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,199
systems and their configurations

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,479
uh we have a we have a tools

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,160
let's call them scanner in general and

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,759
you will use actually one of these tools

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
here in this workshop

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
and how does it work so the scanner it

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,880
can basically do two important things

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,720
first thing is to check the

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,199
configuration

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,960
like it uh i don't know let's give an

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
example that one of the requirements

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,800
from the policy is that

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,680
the minimum password length length on

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,880
the system has to be eight characters

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,160
so the scanner i can check this

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,280
and if if it's possible

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,440
it can also fix it we call it remedy8

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,800
and throughout the whole project so

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,880
remedy8 equals

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,440
fix um

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
and uh but the scanner is just the tool

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,440
yeah scanner is just the tool

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,479
so uh it it can do some things but it

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,039
needs to know

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,800
what to check and what to fix and that's

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,080
when the

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,600
content comes to comes to uh comes to

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,160
the scene

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
and this content has some standard it's

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
uh

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,199
it's called skap which means which

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,960
means security content automation

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
protocol

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,400
and this is the thing which is consumed

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,840
by the scanner and the scanner can

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,680
actually do its work

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,080
and the content is the thing which we

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,520
are going to work with in this workshop

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,280
actually

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,280
uh so next slide please

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
so the compliance is compliance is code

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,560
it's a

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,319
big actually the world's largest open

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
source repository of the security

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
content

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,560
which is used used to achieve compliance

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
i would like to say one more thing

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
you can imagine you can translate

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,960
compliance very loosely as a security

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,080
if you are com if you are compliant you

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
are secure

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
but secure according to some standard

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,199
just just like a

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,600
side note so that so that it's easier

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,560
to understand the terms so back to the

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,639
slide

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,800
uh the the content uh lives on github

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
it's highly customizable as you will see

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
in this workshop because you will you

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
will

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,919
be able to create your own content to

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,960
for your

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,759
use cases and it's compatible

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,440
with various scanners including openscap

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,360
scanner openscap scanner

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,039
uh which you will also use in this uh

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
in this workshop and it's closely

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,840
related to the project

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,759
product uh to the content

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,680
uh you will use its common line

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,400
interface but you will also be

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,680
able to use escap workbench which is

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,160
actually it's

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
it's it's a graphical interface to

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,560
various features

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,680
of of the scanner

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,599
next slide piece so

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,039
now i will tell you just a little bit

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,280
about the content itself

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
how it's how it's uh composed how it's

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,520
produced

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,800
or like why the content looks like like

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,479
it looks

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,720
uh so imagine that you have the

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,240
security policy for example pci dss it's

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,800
a long pdf document

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,000
it can be quite high level and it's of

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,720
course very hard

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it's it's very hard to be consumed by by

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
uh

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,240
by computers because it's written in in

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,440
human readable

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,840
and so what usually happens is that you

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,039
can take this policy and decompose it

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,599
into requirements

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,720
getting to a low level like i don't know

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,319
requirement

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,039
uh prevent root from logging in through

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,639
ssh

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,280
or as i said said configure the system

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,840
so that

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,199
the password has to have at least eight

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,199
characters

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,120
and these are quite low level things and

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,120
these can be

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,599
translated into code so that's where

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,560
the rules come to play in our system

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
in the content because the rule one rule

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,839
is actually

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,120
a specification of some system

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
configuration

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,800
it's composed of some metadata like a

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
description like here what is this rule

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,360
about

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
how it's called uh like

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
which policies reference this rule and

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,839
stuff and then it contains usually

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,200
some check which is written for example

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,480
in all the language

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,560
and this check is then consumed by the

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,519
scanner which we talked about before

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,279
uh and according to this check the

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
scanner checks the configuration file

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,200
like opens the

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,200
uh configuration versus hd and like

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
looks if there is the line

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,240
and if the line is not there it can

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,880
remediate it

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,959
that's uh that's why the rules contain

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
also remediations they can be like bash

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,640
scripts or ansible snippets or

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,560
or or some other other

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,880
scripts we support several languages

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,920
so this is a rule and then we take the

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
rule and

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,920
we take many rules and we put them

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,480
together together with some additional

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,240
metadata and variables

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,600
and this creates something which we call

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,120
profile in the content

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
and with the profile we are at a higher

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,480
level again and the profile

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,959
is actually a

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,000
representation of a policy like pci dss

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,480
but it's code it's already consumable

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,680
by a software in this case uh in this

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,720
workshop it will be openscap scanning

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,399
so that's uh that's what this content is

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,640
about we take policies

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,240
and we decompose it translate into rules

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,320
and you create a profile

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,160
and then you can then actually this

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,800
profile you can use

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,480
to help you with achieving compliance

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,839
like it will not

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
not make your systems magically

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,320
compliant

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
of course you should like review it and

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
some things are not even

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,959
possible to automate properly but it

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,560
will help you i believe in the great

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:50,399
great deal next slide please so this

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,640
is just the this is just a summary

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,399
where can you actually use the content

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,720
uh so you can use it

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,160
together with appropriate scanner like

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,519
open scope

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,160
uh you can use it to scan

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
or like to ensure compliance of uh

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,360
physical machines

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,680
they there can be uh like your uh

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
local machine or it can be also a

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,079
machine which you can

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,360
access through ssh you can achieve

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,839
you can try to achieve compliance

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
over containers for example on podman

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,360
backend or docker backend

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,240
you can also check images of virtual

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
machines

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,920
like hard drive images and you can also

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
use it uh within your kubernetes

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,079
infrastructure

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,399
to ensure that the infrastructure stays

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,959
compliant

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,440
uh that's uh that's i think enough of

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
theory

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
i think we should get to prac some

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
practical things so

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,240
i'm giving a word back to gabriel who

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,240
will tell you something about uh about

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
the workshop

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,760
okay thank you voice for this

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,680
explanation

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,959
um and now i will talk a little bit

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,519
about

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,200
what you will be learning uh throughout

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,880
this workshop

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,440
and uh mainly the first part is composed

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
by

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,040
uh creating rules and and profiles uh

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,040
modifying them and

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,320
making it uh according to your needs

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,560
and then with this content you will

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
perform a scan using the open scuff

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
scanner and checking

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,880
like results if the configuration

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:37,279
actual actually passes or fail

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,519
and furthermore uh you're going to

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,880
learn how to customize the content like

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
change a variable

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
in this case for example the password

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,560
length instead of

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,480
8 my organization requires to be

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,240
12 so this kind of customizations

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,720
and for the last part you will see how

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,040
the

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,760
the ansible remediations are integrated

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,880
to the

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,279
project and how they uh

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,720
are handled by the project and how can

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,680
you can develop them

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,560
and apply the fix to bring the system to

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,560
a desired state

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,279
and now some some of the practical

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,279
considerations for this workshop

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:32,800
can you please mute your microphone

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,800
yes i'm just

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,839
try to find the proper button

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
yeah okay so uh

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,000
and some some practical considerations

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,480
about workshop uh this workshop is

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,320
uh developed uh mainly to be a

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
self-paced workshop

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,040
um everything you need it will be

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,360
written to the documentation

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
and

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,279
this the duration of the session

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,320
unfortunately is like

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,440
quite short

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,600
uh usually it takes like two hours for

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,880
the the whole workshop but

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,079
the environment will stay longer

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,920
so you can finish finish it on

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,920
your own and

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,320
if you have any questions after the

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:45,519
during the the session and after the

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,040
workshop you can use either the chat uh

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,720
here in the hopping

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,320
or the discard channel

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,000
workshop and

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,639
also one extra thing i would like to say

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,920
is that the this workshop is designed to

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,360
to use this

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,279
uh graphical user interface from rel

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,959
so you'll be uh accessing the

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,000
remote desktop and you need to have the

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,959
vnc client

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,199
installed everything is described in the

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,800
documentation how to install how to

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:26,000
to connect if for some reason you

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,519
don't get to you cannot install this

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,040
uh application uh there is

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,880
still a benefit from the workshop

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,959
because like um

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,800
seventy percent of them is uh through

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,320
the command line so

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,720
no worries about that and uh right now

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,240
i'm

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,279
going to do a quick demo of uh how to

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,519
to get access to this uh infrastructure

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,000
infrastructure that we are providing

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,199
providing you

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,880
and so basically there is

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,440
this web page where you can access

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
through this link that i will later post

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,720
to the

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,920
chat the instructions so you can easily

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,560
access

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:14,000
um so let's do it so i have

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,759
here the the page and uh

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,759
i put the security

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,839
keyword and my email address

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
and in this case it will

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,240
lead me to the page like this

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,880
and in the square red box there is the

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
important

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,040
information for this workshop you get

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,279
a unique link that will

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,000
lend you to the page similar to this one

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,800
and uh in this uh documentation it

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,600
contains

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,560
uh for example unique credentials uh

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,480
there is this

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,160
uh embedded terminal that you can use uh

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,280
to ease and uh like this

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,240
um going back from the

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,280
documentation to the terminal but uh of

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,839
course you can use

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,000
your own terminal there are like uh the

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,439
gradations at the

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,400
ssh command to connect so it's really up

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,919
to you

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,919
so if i get back to the

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,200
to the page here it

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,480
gave me this link and let's say

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,480
i open it here

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,880
yeah you can scroll here then there is

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
the setup steps

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
uh it's the place where you have the

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,280
credentials so

00:17:50,559 --> 00:18:01,840
you can basically copy paste and

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,840
use the password

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,720
so now you're in you have like the

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,200
the labs everything what i'm saying is

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,400
described in the documentation

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,799
and uh right now for the uh

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,039
vnc client there are some instructions

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,360
on how to connect to the

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,400
how to install the target tiger vnc

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,600
application

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,880
but then there is this trick that you

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,080
have to use

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,039
to open the tunnel you have to use your

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,880
own terminal

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:39,120
so you go back to your terminal

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,320
paste the command and it will ask for

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,120
the password

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,400
so you input the password and you notice

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
that it will

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
uh show nothing here it will hang

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,000
because

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,919
after you are finished with the lab you

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
can just

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,919
kill this application with ctrl c

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,520
and in another tab in this case

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,799
there is the vnc viewer

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,760
you have to run it

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,600
in this case you can also like just run

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,400
vnt viewer

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:22,960
and it will show you this uh

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:26,240
window you put localhost colon1

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,480
and it will ask for a password again and

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,600
it's basically the same one and uh

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,200
here and then you have the access to the

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,240
user interface and from here you

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,120
you can access the web browser

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
the scrap workbench and everything that

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,160
is described

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,160
in the documentation from this workshop

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,320
so now going back to the presentation

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,320
as i said uh

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,559
i would like just before uh giving the

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,159
the

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,360
links just some references uh this work

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,559
workshop is available as a static uh

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,600
version so there are no like credentials

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,120
it's just the documentation so you can

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,240
use as a reference

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:25,039
later and there's also the possibility

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,919
to run this same workshop on a fedora vm

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,799
so there are instructions on how to set

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
up your

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,880
vm accordingly and furthermore there are

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,159
some

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,280
links to where to reach us after the

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,000
workshop

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,760
for example the discussion pages and

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,679
some mailing lists

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,679
and etc so

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:53,840
finally i will be pasting the

00:20:50,559 --> 00:21:03,840
instructions to the chat if you

00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:03,840
don't have it already

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,200
so you just click this link and input

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,559
the data and you will be able to access

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,600
your environment

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,400
so i guess this is it pretty much from

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,080
the

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,520
the presentation um we'll be

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,799
uh here to answer

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,640
any questions you have during this

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:39,039
first phases and after the session

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:45,840
finishes will be around the

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,840
