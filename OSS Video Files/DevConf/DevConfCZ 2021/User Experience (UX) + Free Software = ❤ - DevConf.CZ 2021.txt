	Speaker: Máirín Duffy



We want free software to matter, to reach its highest potential to change the world for the better. In many fields, however, there is a massive gap between the existence of these tools and their actual usage on the front lines. How do we bridge that gap, so free software has a chance to make a difference? We need better UX to bridge that gap. This talk outlines a case study of a free software platform - the ChRIS project - aiming to bridge that gap between the wealth of free sofware medical analytical tools and frontline clinical practice with a user experience that meets the needs of medical researchers and clinicians. We believe ChRIS will help deliver the UX clinicians need to give them access to amazing free software tools that can improve medicine.
