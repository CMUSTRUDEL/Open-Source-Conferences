Publication date: 2021-03-15
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: David Duncan

In this workshop, you will learn to build your first Fedora CoreOS deployment best practices and how to build a basic pipeline for your container workloads. We will cover getting started with a basic deployment, building your first Ignition file, booting on a cloud (AWS), and booting on a local hypervisor. We will install, build a simplified pipeline for maintenance, and upgrade your installation. Once we have a pipeline for maintenance, you can explore how to make changes to the base by switching streams and starting services on first boot.
