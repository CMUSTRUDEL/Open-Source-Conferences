Description: 
	Speaker: John Hill

Selenium has been the unchallenged leader in open source UI testing since 2004. The web has changed since then and our tools should, too.

In this talk, we'll go over the problems with Selenium and how the new tools solve them. We'll (cross our fingers and) do some live demos with webdriver.io, puppeteer, playwright and cypress. We'll end with Selenium 4.0 and what it might mean for your current project.
