Open Source has become the defining way of developing software. If open source made software great, how do we “open source” a software service or the operations of the cloud?
You may be thinking: “Wait a second - all my source code is shared right here. Of course, it’s open!”
Open means, getting involved in the community is easy. Open Source is powered by a simple function: Converting a small percentage of users into contributors.

For Operations this means all data is accessible: issues, tickets, metrics. We coined the term “Operate First” for this. We want to run the software in an operational context, by the group that develops the software.
For Software as a Service we must combine several existing DevOps, SRE and deployment principles to function as a true Open Source contribution model.

In this interactive panel discussion, we will explore what challenges are ahead, how to apply lessons learned from an Open Source culture and some concrete examples how this journey already started within the Packit and OpenDataHub community.
