resilience

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
over to you alyssa hello everyone my

after this talk thank you

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,239
so here's the agenda um what we're going

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,160
to be talking about today

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
starting by introducing the topic of

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,840
inclusion then moving on to

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,959
neurodiversity the agile mindset and

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
resilience

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,560
and finally psychological safety

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
and the business value of all of this

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,080
and before we dive into neurodiversity

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,480
resilience agile and other terms let's

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,720
start

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
with a little reminder of what

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,319
inclusivity is

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
what does inclusivity actually look like

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,959
what does inclusion actually look like

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
inclusion is embracing differences in

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,040
people and perspectives so that we can

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
all use our individual strengths to

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,360
contribute our best

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
it's inviting everyone to bring their

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
authentic selves to work every day

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,120
treating each other fairly and

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,840
respectfully and recognizing that we all

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
have something uniquely valuable to

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,800
offer

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,599
the definition that we actually use for

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,440
inclusion

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,080
is inclusion is um embracing differences

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,480
in people and perspectives so that we

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,120
can all use our individual strengths to

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,840
contribute

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
our best

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,440
in regards to agility inclusion is a

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,920
vital component to the overall success

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,480
of a project be it within our everyday

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,280
life

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,040
home school homeschooling or work life

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
delivering a valuable product

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,200
looking at our resilience inclusion of

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,239
others to support ourselves and build

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,239
connections is key

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,000
yeah uh let me describe and explain

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
about this this picture

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
uh you can see few circles demonstrating

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
the differences between

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,080
inclusion exclusion segregation

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
integration

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
we have a variety of colorful dots uh to

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,000
see the differences here

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,200
yeah to demonstrate the differences here

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
so exclusion on the left down shows how

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,840
it could look in

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,040
exclusive environment all dots that are

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
not the same green color are excluded

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,880
are not uh

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,840
part of the circle are outside of it

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,840
around

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
yeah uh segregation

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,199
excuse me um segregation uh

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
look at the middle picture there are two

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
circles

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,040
one main with only green dots and

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,240
one small circle full of full of colors

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,360
so it's being separated uh from

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,000
each other yeah this

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,040
is great to see i really like um this

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,840
illustration here

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,440
the differences between each and just

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
looking at this what is the difference

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
between

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,400
inclusion and integration um

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
well integration it is pictured here as

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,039
two closed circles

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,919
small colorful circle is a part of big

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,199
circle

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,320
but not really a part it is in there

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
but it's still kind of kind of separated

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,680
right

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,720
so inclusion at the top of the picture

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,639
shows

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,919
all colorful dots together in in in one

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,199
circle

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,720
copyrighting uh being together

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,160
um dots of whatever color in one circle

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
to the difference

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,759
so the difference is that the inclusion

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,639
truly is a mix it's it's

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
cooperating together yeah integrated

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
workplace

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,400
is um is a setting where neural atypical

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,639
work alongside neurotypical or

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,320
whatever diversity we are talking about

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,320
yeah everyone

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,120
is held to a standard set of working

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,680
yeah inclusion is the actual merging

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,440
of of all of it of the needs with the

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
belief that all people are different

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,120
will learn differently and should have

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,479
access to resources

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,440
so the workplace expectations

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,080
are adjusted so that everyone has their

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,199
needs met

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,600
and everyone can do their best

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,840
okay that makes sense and it's a really

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,039
good distinction between the two

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,199
i wonder by integrating

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
in an organization by integrating do we

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,840
feel

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
and that we feel like we're actually

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,000
practicing inclusion

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
uh whether we might not be but not know

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,880
it

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,960
oh yeah we are and uh you're right yeah

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,039
we have some space for a few further

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,240
steps that's for sure

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,280
okay um next slide please

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,199
before i i speak about neurodiversity

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,039
and explain this term

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,400
uh let me please refresh and explain the

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,280
word diversity

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,960
uh as we touched by the inclusion here i

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
believe that most of us heard this word

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,960
very many times

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,160
diversity can be defined as the range of

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,360
human differences

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,800
that create our individual and uh shared

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,639
experiences

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,520
and when we talk about diversity we

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,400
usually uh tend to think about

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
uh gender national origin ethnicity

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,520
ethnicity

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,520
or sexual orientation all of it it

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
definitely belongs under it but

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,639
diversity spans many more

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,000
dimensions emo will talk about those in

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,639
a moment

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,680
um physical and mental ability or

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,880
attributes

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,400
so neurodiversity all of it belongs to

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
the list and and much more

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
for sure

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,680
so neurodiversity next slide please

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,879
neurodiversity is the concept that the

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,639
neurological differences between

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,319
people should be respected and

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,080
recognized so it basically is one of the

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,039
diversity perspective as i already

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,440
mentioned

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,400
only focus on the fact that each mind is

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,479
different

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,599
yeah and instead of using terms with

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,720
this like

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,360
dysfunction disabilities

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
disorders this term neurodiversity is

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
enabling it takes into

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,199
account account um the neurological

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,720
differences

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,599
it's not one size fits all we're all

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,520
different

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,280
and neurodiversity celebrates the

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,759
difference yeah

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,919
um it just refers to variation in the

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,960
human brain regarding socially but the

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,599
social ability uh learning attention

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,800
mood

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,800
and other mental function

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,199
next slide

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,560
not all minds are created equal

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,000
and that's okay maybe a little example

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,360
would help with the perspective on

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
neurodiversity so

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
a few names of famous persons with some

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,959
diagnosis for example

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,160
bill gates uh has autism john chambers

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,480
who's a former cisco ceo has adhd

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,480
and the list could surely continue so

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,600
why would neurodiversity matter

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,480
yeah for that reason that not all minds

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,120
are created equal

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
right and uh the chemical balance in my

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,279
brain is unique to me

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,800
as yours is unique to you more

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,120
neurodiverse persons are

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,399
are cited with having uh higher levels

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
of creativity

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
and different capabilities than others

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,560
who are neurotypical

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
yeah for example dyslexia autism and

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,959
adhd or result in the

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
ability to see connections uh others

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,800
cannot

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,760
yeah so this person can create a

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,720
narrative that

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,320
helps to simplify complex projects or

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,760
tasks

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,839
and it's not only the condition we were

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,080
born with it could include also

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,320
situations happening around us like

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,240
the recent situation with the covet 19

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
worldwide pandemic for example it

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
affects us

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,360
all a lot and uh it could affect

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,360
or challenge our mental health some of

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,800
us might recently experience the

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,440
world more like uh neurodiverse person

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,200
so given the cert given the recent

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,920
situation now more than ever

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,120
we we need to innovate and we need more

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
allies

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,399
yeah more more understanding and

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,519
educated people in this area

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,040
just the creative and diverse

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,959
minds um i would like to also mention

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,880
that neurodiversity is the idea that the

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,320
neurological differences like autism

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,279
adhd and the

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,200
are the result of of normal natural

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,839
variation in the human

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:35,040
human genome yeah um what else

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,040
neurodiversity covers um

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
in addition to addressing what makes us

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
uh unique neurodiversity also addresses

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,399
how we take care

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,360
of ourselves so uh based on these

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,240
factors of

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,880
these aren't also known like mental

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,360
health or

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,360
mental mental wellness

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
uh now when i talk about what

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
neurodiversity is let me

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
please let me tell you what

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,600
neurodiversity is not

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,959
it's a very important part to know it

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,160
helps us understand this even better

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,200
so this is not a perspective it's uh

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,800
not an approach it's not a belief or

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:22,000
political position or paradigm

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,000
neurodiversity is a biological fact

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,839
i think that's another great uh

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,920
distinction there um

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,880
so definitely thanks so much for sharing

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,040
that and

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
that it's not as you said a perspective

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
and or a belief

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
that it's part of our makeup that is our

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,160
biological fact

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
thanks for that

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,279
so um we just want to talk a little bit

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,000
about what diversity is

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,600
there are different levels of diversity

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
i won't list everything that's written

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
here

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
however they are linked to identity such

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
as

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,320
age for example thinking someone is too

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,320
you too young to know something or too

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,079
old to keep up with the latest trends

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
it could be upbringing your native

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,519
language having not having english as

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,120
your native language

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:13,600
will impact you and your ability to

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,079
interact um social economic group

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
what financial resources did you have

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,480
access to

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,800
as a child or now um

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,639
organizational where are you based

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,320
within your organization

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,720
what job do you do how long have you

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,079
been in your role the company culture

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,160
will also impact um on the business

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,560
outcomes that are listed here

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,600
such as a better understanding of our

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,959
customers

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,680
creative leadership a diverse workforce

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,160
and important for every company a strong

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,240
financial performance

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,320
uh yet i would like to mention the best

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,079
companies have realized neurodiversity

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,920
is a competitive advantage like

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,800
hpe uh sap ibm or or microsoft just for

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,639
example

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,200
so there are surely much more of

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,920
companies focusing that way already and

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,959
it's just not about only the hiring

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
initiative

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,360
managers and associates needs to be

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
equipped to collaborate with and lead in

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
a way

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,279
that is psychologically safe for people

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
who

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,000
who see the world or experience the

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
world differently

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,880
okay thanks for that aliska so let's

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,079
jump in

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,480
um to the world of agility um

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,600
agility is the ability to adapt and

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
respond to change

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,880
quickly we practice agility naturally

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
every day

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,800
by adapting to our changing environments

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,959
you might wake up

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,560
one morning after a great night's sleep

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,040
and are ready to take on

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,040
your ever growing to-do list but to

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,199
discover that you're out of coffee

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,440
what would you do you'd naturally

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,399
practice agility and adapt in that

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,800
moment

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,040
you may decide to try and manage without

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,120
coffee for the morning and drink tea

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,720
but let's face it that to-do list is

00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
going to be a little bit harder to

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,760
tackle

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,600
or you might decide to nip to the shops

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,079
resulting in you maybe have to

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,320
prioritize an item on that to-do list or

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,639
move it to the next day

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,880
having the ability to adapt and make the

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,480
choices with the information we have

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,560
comes naturally to us

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,720
and we always gain an opportunity to

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,880
chalk down some lessons learned

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
so for example doubling up on your

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,720
coffee intake

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,160
or your coffee shop during the week or

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,040
build in some wiggle room

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,600
into your daily plans so 2020 in 2021

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,120
has had us practicing agility on another

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,440
level

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,440
this could be from building in time into

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,360
your day for home schooling

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
or checking in on family members to

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,480
ensure that they are minding themselves

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,680
and minding their health we manage

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
better when we include

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
others in our plans so reaching out

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
maybe to a teacher

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
for further insight into that maths

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,399
problem that you might be having with

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,560
your son or daughter

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,720
or reaching out to siblings to help with

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,720
the load of caring for your parents

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,680
we can have a greater impact together

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,000
and even have some fun in the process

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,160
alyssa animo i'd be really interested to

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,440
hear how we had to adapt

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,360
throughout last year or so

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,560
well i guess we all learned a lesson

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,320
about that during 2020 and still ongoing

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
uh it was a year that challenged me

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
quite a bit and

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,920
made me realize how lucky i am in some

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,720
areas yeah for example i was able to

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,959
keep

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
working from home that's that's great

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,880
and also i had the option to adjust my

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,199
living space for

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,000
for my hobby uh we built a pretty decent

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,839
gym

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,839
uh in the in the garage to keep

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
exercising

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,279
so for me um i would usually travel back

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,800
to the uk

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,639
every couple of months i live here in

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,720
the in the czech republic

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,160
but with covert that just wasn't

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
possible not without

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,440
spending weeks on end in quarantine so i

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
needed to find ways to

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,480
recharge my batteries without traveling

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,399
home to

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
see my friends and family in london

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,720
okay that's great that's great you know

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,000
to to hear how you had to

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,480
um and adapt in in the moment

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,440
and and to find ways of building in

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,839
exercise

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,720
and at home and connecting with people

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,720
differently

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,160
and so thanks so much for for sharing

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,279
that okay

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,480
so let's take a deeper look into agility

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,480
and in the world of work

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,720
when we refer to agility at work we

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,519
refer to it as

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,240
agile you may be familiar with the term

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,199
agile

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,560
or maybe if not familiar with the term

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,959
agile definitely

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,759
probably with the terms uh scrum and

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
kanban

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,639
which are agile frameworks this is

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,720
simply bringing the ability to practice

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,199
agility into the workplace

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,120
so allowing us to quickly um adapt and

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,800
change based on the information that we

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
have at hand

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,880
agile frameworks practices and tools are

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,559
built around this

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
and recognizes the importance of

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,720
information to deliver

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
a valuable product or service to our to

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,640
our users

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
these frameworks tools and practices

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
enable us to collaborate

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
communicate and gain feedback to fuel

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,000
continuous improvement

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,679
there has been a recent shift um over

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,880
the last couple of years in working at

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,039
organizations

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,320
to spend just as much time supporting

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,720
teams to embrace the agile mindset as it

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,840
is to encourage them to experiment

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,679
with using some frameworks and tools

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,600
so what we're trying to do is to tap

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,080
into the right side of the brain so our

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,240
emotional and social site

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,640
they recognize that for us to change our

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,720
ways of working to be more inclusive

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,200
and collaborative we need a lot more

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,440
than just frameworks and processes

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
we need to spend time training our minds

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,760
to be more open

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,000
curious trusting and courageous

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,280
to ensure our processes and frameworks

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,480
are effective

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,280
so combining an agile mindset with these

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,280
frameworks

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,799
results in sharing information and

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,520
collaborating together

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,240
on new ideas to deliver the best value

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,200
to the market

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,039
and our communities so we know the

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,919
frameworks we know the tools the

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,799
practices

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,120
but how do we suddenly start being agile

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,080
it's not as easy as following steps in a

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,280
framework

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,200
it is a complete mindset mindset shift

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
that may take us a little bit out of our

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
comfort zone

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:42,960
building on our resilience can really

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:45,440
help support you on this journey

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,039
so let's look at resilience resilience

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,280
is the ability to adapt

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
openly in the face of adversity and

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,200
change

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,799
a greek philosopher once said change is

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,679
the only constant in life

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,960
and how true you are change will happen

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,160
and in our world today

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,799
it's changing at a much faster pace

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,799
constant change is the norm a lot of the

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,799
time we have very little control

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,640
over that change but what we can try and

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,600
manage a little bit better

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,200
is how we react to change and adversity

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,120
not trying to control

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,280
and stop the change but becoming more

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,039
open to explore the opportunities it may

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,200
bring

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,360
yeah uh sarah would you please help me

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,720
understand better why the word uh

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,760
positively is crossed out yeah no

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,480
problem melissa

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,960
um so i've crossed that out and swapped

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,520
in the

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
the term openly here sometimes there's a

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,760
lot of pressure on people

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,640
uh when change is on the horizon or

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,880
we're asked to do

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
or work and in a different way or try

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,760
out any way of working

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,559
there could be pressure on us to accept

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,120
that change

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,960
as positively as as we can and we do try

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,840
to do that but i think it creates a

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,600
barrier

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,440
and it breaks down the reality of the

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,679
actual situation that it can be a little

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,799
bit unnerving a little bit unsettling

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,440
and to try new things so i think a more

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,360
and a better term here is just to

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,679
embrace a little bit more openly be a

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,799
little bit more curious and inquisitive

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
instead of positively yeah thank you i

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,960
agree

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,640
i was asking about it because my

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,440
thinking is that sometimes we

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
just insist too much on on positivity

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,039
like being

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,120
positive optimistic it actually uh

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,280
could cause more harm than good i think

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,880
being ourselves and looking for brighter

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,799
sides yes but

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,159
staying optimistic and positive all the

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,320
time doesn't really

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,400
seem to me like unhealthy perspective or

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,120
or sometimes even an option

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,799
absolutely no problem and sometimes it

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
can actually be a barrier to change when

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,159
we're told we need to

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
react to it positively as well so thanks

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
for sharing that

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,679
appreciate that

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,720
okay next slide so

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,679
to truly adopt an agile mindset

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,039
we need to build in our resilience to be

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,520
ready for change

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,360
to be inclusive and to seek out the

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,760
opportunity

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,280
yeah i really like that you mentioned

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,919
the opportunity that awaits

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,200
yeah because with change you know comes

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,240
opportunity so

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,280
it's trying to to focus on a little bit

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,760
more on

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
like again if this is the term

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,120
opportunity

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,799
like what kind of brain who else can i

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,919
work with what can i learn

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,960
and what can i um help out with and

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,720
things like that

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,240
and trying to embrace the excitement

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,240
even of of change

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,360
next slide

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,159
so let's look at resilience here and how

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,440
we can

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,320
and spend time on building that to allow

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
us to

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,679
adapt a little bit better and become

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,840
more open to change

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,320
so like building a muscle increasing

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,799
your resilience takes time and effort

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,320
and it will look different for everyone

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,400
so i won't and

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,600
wake up today and say today i'm going to

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,760
be resilient

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,200
and my mindset is going to change like

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,640
that and

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,760
and that's it no unfortunately not

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
we need to work on on what that means to

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,559
us

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,080
so what might mean um but i am sure i'm

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,240
taking plenty of breaks throughout my

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,200
day to allow me to decompress

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,280
and and digest build in some some

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,480
exercise building time to get out

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,320
and out for fresh air and especially um

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,880
with cole but 19 we've been really

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,080
restricted in what we can do there to

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,080
to help us decompress and and to unwind

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
and so we've had to become very creative

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,039
in in that

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,440
and and it will look different for

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,760
everyone so for somebody it might be

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,600
uh that they have a morning yoga session

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,679
uh that sets them up for the day

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,080
and they listen to a meditation at night

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,480
to unwind or for somebody else it might

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,280
be

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,640
going for a walk and during lunchtime

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,640
and connecting

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,080
uh with others you know through box sets

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,600
of of netflix and

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,360
and things that they're watching as well

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,400
so it's really just trying to find what

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,000
works for you

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,760
and ensuring that you're spending enough

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,640
time um on

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
on prioritizing that and to support

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,640
yourself

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:17,120
um in it so next slide

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
so these are the four cornerstones of

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,919
building your resilience

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,600
first is to build your connections so to

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,320
ensure that you're reaching out to

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,520
people

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,559
as i said earlier working together

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,440
and is much better it creates a

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,760
connection

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
and and we could actually have fun as

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
well even when we're working you know to

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,960
be able to

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,159
to reach out to your colleagues and to

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,039
obviously you know

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,679
work together on on valuable pieces of

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
work

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,720
but to and enjoy that and get to know

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
each other

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,760
and as as um as much as you can

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
and so you could do that you know what

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
you have in social sessions with them

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,600
maybe um pop quizzes

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,559
maybe have a celebration uh calls with

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,559
each quarter

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,320
whatever that might be and also connect

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,760
with family members as well

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
and definitely ensure that you're

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,480
building that in

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,320
feed yourself healthy thoughts so again

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
it's been quite challenging last year

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,960
and this year

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,480
and being confined and that sometimes we

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
can spend a little bit too much time in

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,840
our minds

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,640
and and we might feel if we're juggling

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,159
a lot at home

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
we're juggling maybe looking after

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,559
parents maybe um

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
homeschooling and whatever that might be

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,799
as well as our work

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,720
and we we might be self-doubting having

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,559
a bit of self-doubt around things so

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,840
ensure that you're feeding yourself

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,520
healthy thoughts knowing that you're

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,159
doing really well in the situation that

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
you're in

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,440
and that what you can do every day is

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,440
good enough

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,039
you're brilliant i second to that just

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,720
to mention the building the resilience

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,760
could be different for everyone as you

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,960
already said

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,480
neurotypical or neuro-atypical but it

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:58,000
makes us no less valuable that's it

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,799
exactly um and key as well is to have a

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,960
purpose

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,840
so to know your why and to strive

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,320
towards that

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,919
every day it doesn't necessarily you

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,919
need to be work related it can

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,559
absolutely be on a personal level as

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,720
well

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,720
but building small little goals that you

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,520
feel you're achieving each day or each

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
week

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,120
and to to kind of help you on that

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
journey

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,799
and last but definitely not least is is

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,200
wellness so to ensure that you're

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,520
minding your body and your mind

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,279
so as we all know ensuring we're having

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,039
water healthy foods

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,360
obviously the odd little treat now and

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,320
again but ensure we're getting enough

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,520
sleep

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,559
and exercise and and just minding

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,039
ourselves in

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,679
in general and trying to prioritize our

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,400
general

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,640
and well-being will will support you on

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
your resilience journey

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,679
so now i'm going to hand you over to

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,880
emote who's going to chat to you about

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
how you can be more inclusive

00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,799
and of course i forgot to unmute um

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,919
so there are many ways to be more

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,480
inclusive

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,360
including creating opportunities for

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,640
people to share

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,039
and contribute um valuing

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,919
your contribution as well as that of

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
others

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,120
making sure that they are aware that you

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,080
value that

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,919
contribution being accepting of your own

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,279
strengths and weaknesses

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,320
and knowing when to ask for help it is

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,039
often especially difficult uh to ask for

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,840
help i think

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,000
engineers have this built-in thing that

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,960
we must fix this we must know how to

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,279
resolve this

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,760
and so we're less likely to ask for help

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,279
viewing challenges and disagreements as

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,279
opportunities to learn

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,159
um you know every it's just a different

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,640
point of view

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,679
um and if you can learn from that you

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,200
will

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,240
grow as a person as a result

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
acknowledging that change is constant as

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,120
sarah

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,360
already mentioned it's the only thing

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,840
that stays the same

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,240
and looking for those opportunities to

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,400
grow listen more

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,200
listen to your teams listen to the

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,240
people who perhaps don't often speak up

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,840
um just listen and listen to yourself if

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,320
you're tired go to bed be kind to

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,440
yourself

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,440
actively advocate for inclusion um

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,600
if you know that there is somebody who

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,840
is a little more quiet in meetings

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,440
um or in your friendship group ask their

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,840
opinion

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,480
and do it in a way that is that works

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,080
for them

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,080
um so if you know they don't want to

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,279
speak up in front of 10 people

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,240
ask them on a one-to-one um and

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,159
last but by no means least instill

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,279
psychological safety

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:52,000
um make sure that the area is

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,480
safe for people to to speak up and

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,840
alicia

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
is going to talk us through what

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,559
psychological safety is

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,000
yeah thank you emma it was really nicely

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,399
sad all of it

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
so uh psychological safety the

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,720
cornerstone

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,120
um psychological safety can be defined

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,559
as

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,840
uh being able to show and employ oneself

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,559
without a fear of of the negative

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,000
consequences of self-made status

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,200
career it can be defined as uh

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,799
as a shared belief that the team or

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,880
the environment is safe for

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,240
interpersonal risk taking

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,120
yeah in psychologically safe teams team

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
members

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,080
feel accepted and respected so they feel

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,200
like they can express themselves

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,480
disagree say no be

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,480
authentic even make a mistake yeah

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:50,000
and um good news it's within our control

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,120
so individual contribution matter very

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,679
very much your attitude can change a lot

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,679
as emma mentioned in her previous slide

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,279
value contribution of others

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,520
for example for for just for example um

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,720
there are a few good questions we can uh

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,760
ask ourselves

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,679
within our teams groups or

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,200
communities whatever environment we

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,480
would like to apply it

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,799
at so do people feel comfortable

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,600
saying no uh can meetings be declined or

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,440
rescued without fear

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,840
these are just an example of the

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,240
questions we can ask

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,480
ourselves a big part of

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,000
psychological safety is to show

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,039
vulnerability or

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,080
fall ability openly ask

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,279
on openly ask for feedback on how you

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,080
deliver

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,559
gracefully admit when you're wrong or

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,600
just

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,240
admit when you're wrong right we

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,799
ourselves can be the leading example and

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,320
model behaviors we would like to see by

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,440
assuming a good intent so in addition to

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,960
that let's not jump

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,919
to conclusion or and blaming but ask

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,640
a few more questions first being said

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,799
replace

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,600
blame with uh with curiosity

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,520
engage in exploration together to find a

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,200
find a solution

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,279
and uh please remember uh safety looks

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,919
different for everyone

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,720
and uh in light of covet 19 as we

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,640
touched it

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
a few times here and restrictions

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,440
related to the situation

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,000
more people people than than ever uh

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
before

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,480
might be experiencing life as a

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,200
neurodiverse individual

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,399
and the stigma and luck of safety may

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,600
prevent them

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,919
from seeking help yeah so i would like

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,159
to encourage you to be open-minded and

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,840
look out for each other despite most of

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,320
us work from home

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,159
um everything the way we work so that it

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,200
is safer and more productive

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,520
for all the all the team members

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,919
whether biologically neurodiverse or

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,080
just temporarily coping

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,320
and also these neurodiverse persons may

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,279
be uh maybe your peers

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,799
yeah maybe your direct reports or your

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,919
manager and you never

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,799
never know uh you might never know it

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,360
especially if they if they don't feel

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,399
safe

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,360
sharing yeah so

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,960
uh one more thing uh statistics shows

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,600
some interesting numbers like

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,240
one in four people will report a mental

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,559
condition

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,159
in their lifetime so it's not really

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,679
that small number right

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,919
um just one one one of the reasons why

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,000
one of the many reasons why psych

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,720
psychological safety is uh

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,720
is important

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,399
sarah thanks for that and really

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,840
important points and on psychological

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,799
safety there and especially around the

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,720
vulnerability

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,919
so if you get more leadership and senior

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,919
leadership teams and

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,360
managers asking more questions and

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,039
showing their vulnerability hopefully

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,240
that will ensure others

00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,960
will will feel safe doing so as well

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,279
so let's look at what business value can

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,720
um

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,200
inclusion deliver so when we include

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,159
others and into our conversations

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,240
and it can limit a group think so it

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
creates an opportunity for us to

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,559
learn and from a range of workplace

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,600
skills and obviously then that was going

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,799
to transpire

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,919
into um more valuable conversations

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:27,200
and more innova innovative uh ways of

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,880
of working and even on our solutions

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,320
when we recognize that our contribution

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,320
is value and considered

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,440
we also actively engage a little bit

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,360
more so if

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,320
um we see uh people actually listening

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,880
and actioning

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,320
some of uh what we're suggesting we're

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,960
going to keep suggesting things we're

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,080
going to

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,840
push the boat out and try new things and

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,240
so it's ensure that ensure that we keep

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,679
that in place and inclusion really helps

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,159
that

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,000
yeah companies are embracing diversity

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,640
of identities as emo described

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,159
to you previously uh neurodiverse

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,399
employees for example bring

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,519
unique experience and skill sets to your

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,240
environment so

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,320
neurodiverse individuals are and uh

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,120
could be an untapped pool of talent and

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,000
with

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,399
uh just an example 80 percent of

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,320
autistic people in ireland

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,760
are being unemployed but there is a huge

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,080
resource uh

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,279
to help fill the skills shortage gap

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,640
especially in

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,799
in i.t or or finance sectors

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,880
yeah so nerdy burst companies have been

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,600
proven to out think and outperform some

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,320
heterogeneous spaces

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,399
and uh one more thing to add people with

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,320
dyslexia often have a

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,919
average or above average intelligence

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,399
with excellent creative

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,640
thinking skills so they tend to have

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,960
strong problem solving capabilities this

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,559
allows them to see

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,720
see variety of solutions to the problem

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,240
or or people with autism tend to excel

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,519
in areas like a rule

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,799
rule-based rule-based thinking

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,120
uh so many orgasm organizations um are

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,720
are experiencing the benefits from

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,600
including individuals with these

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,399
strengths and

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,520
and i just touched this but uh yeah

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,000
definitely

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,079
limit the group thing yeah but by

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,520
working with the diverse team employees

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,359
have

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,879
people in that groups have more

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,440
opportunity to learn from

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,280
uh from a range of of workplace skills

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,119
absolutely that's good they're really

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,599
really great points there

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,480
and so yeah just touching based on on

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,720
some others

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,639
and so the with innovation and

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,000
exploration so soar as barriers to

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,480
contribution are removed

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,359
so they said that previously and we

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,359
start thinking

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,679
outside the box and exploring a little

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,240
bit more what we can do

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,000
and the group feel more and empowered

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,679
the organization and teams being more

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,520
empowered as an open culture and a

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,960
happier workforce

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,960
and they they take pride in the

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,520
collaborative effort to deliver a

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,440
valuable

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,040
quality product or service so they feel

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,760
proud in their contribution

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,839
at what the end and what the end product

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,839
is

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,480

um and it is up to me to recap what

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,440
we've

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,400
spoken about today um neurodiversity

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,480
that is part of diversity and inclusion

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,760
psychological safety is particularly

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,000
important um

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,839
for neurodiverse individuals as it

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,800
really is for everybody

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,079
um and it's often hidden it's often not

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,160
immediately visible

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,920
um you don't necessarily know if your
