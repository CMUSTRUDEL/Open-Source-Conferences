In this lab we’ll walk you through converting your CentOS 8 systems to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 using an open-source conversion utility called Convert2RHEL. You will not only try the simplest one-command solution that does all the magic but also learn how to run this remotely through Ansible.

Ideally, before joining the workshop, do the following preparation:

    Install Vagrant on your system if you don't already have a CentOS system that you wish to convert (https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation). Run `vagrant init centos/8` and `vagrant up` to have the CentOS 8 image pre-downloaded (~900MB).
    Create a Red Hat Personal account through https://access.redhat.com/, or at least read through the Privacy Policy in advance (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-policy).
    Read through the Terms and Conditions of the Red Hat Developer Subscription for Individuals (https://developers.redhat.com/terms-and-conditions).
    Read through the Red Hat EULA which is neccessary to accept before proceeding with the conversion of CentOS to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Red_Hat_GPLv2-Based_EULA_20191118.pdf).
