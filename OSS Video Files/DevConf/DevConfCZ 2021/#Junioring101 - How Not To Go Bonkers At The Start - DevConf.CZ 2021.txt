	Speaker: Daria Grudzien


How to be successful in your first technical position? How to boost your learning? How to get all the support you need from your colleagues without taking up their whole time? These are just some of the questions every junior is grappling with. Whether you've graduated from a technical university, changed careers or are self-taught, your first job will have a critical impact on your future. It will help you create your work and learning habits, propel you into a particular development path, and last but not least - it will help you build a network of peers which will be critical to your future in the field. Make the most of it.

In this session you will learn:
- tips & tricks for boosting your learning
- some of the most important skills nobody talks about in school
- the importance of managing your mentors and reviewers
- what it means to take responsibility for task delivery
- how to make it easier for your senior colleagues to help you
- the critical skill of managing your own well-being

This talk is aimed at people starting their career in the field of Software Engineering and Web Development - regardless of whether they are DevOps, SREs, developers, operators, or testers. The techniques are applicable for people at every level of seniority, though. Based on my experience technical seniority doesn't always correspond to non-technical seniority (and skills like team work, time management, continuous learning, and communication).
