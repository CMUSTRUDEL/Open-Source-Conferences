hi i'm matthew miller i

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,880
am the fedora project leader and i've

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,200
given a talk like this at devconf

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,240
many times not every year but lots of

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,719
the years

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,960
um it's really sad to not be there in

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,240
person i suppose i shouldn't go on too

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,880
much about that let's celebrate the

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,359
happiness

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,960
i'm wearing my um 10 years of fedora

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,800
shirt like i usually do

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,119
for presentations so there we go

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,000
that that's the same at least i'm going

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,040
to try and go through this

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
quickly and get to q a fast because i

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,239
don't like being in a vacuum talking to

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
my slides

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
there are some polls over in the poll

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,040
section go ahead and

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,079
do do the polls that would be fun and

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
here we go with

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,039
the talk um

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,640
wait i thought there was a slide before

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,480
this okay here we go yeah so i'm gonna

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
talk about um what's going on

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,719
i'm gonna talk about where we're going

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,239
next um i'm gonna show you some graphs

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
because that's an important part of my

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,640
state of fedora talk and i'm going to

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
talk a little bit about why you should

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
get involved but the last session

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,000
covered that a lot so i'll go quickly

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,159
there and then we'll go to questions

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,280
um yeah so the first thing how things

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
are going up

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,600
the when when this year started with the

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,320
pandemic i mean last year

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,680
um it you know devconf was one of the

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,560
this is one of the last things that

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,119
happened and then

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,880
um everything got locked down and it was

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,200
looking to be a pretty bleak year and i

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240
wasn't expecting very much but it turned

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
out that we were

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,360
actually awesome in fedora

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,680
congratulations

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
everybody who's part of the project and

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,360
um to

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
everybody who's around it as well i

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,680
chose this quote

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,479
from a vlogger uh

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,560
about fedora that i really liked because

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,560
sometimes in my talk on fedora

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
i actually had like burning dumpsters in

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
the slides like it felt like things were

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
not going well

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,119
but here's a great talk about a great

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,280
quote about how we are on fire

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,799
in a good way and i'm really proud of

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,600
this it's awesome and

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
that's really translated to a lot of

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
linux

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,880
enthusiasts community really um rallying

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,040
behind fedora

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,399
in an awesome way which is great to see

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,319
for a distribution that is you know

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,360
getting to be 20 years old to see all

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,000
this enthusiasm

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
from you know people who look like they

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
might not have even been born when

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,400
fedora was started

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,760
so cool to see that um here and it

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,680
wasn't just um

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
just you know various enthusiasts some

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,760
of the really big podcasts as well

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,800
um the 2020 tuxes had fedora as

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,840
the uh the listeners choice on linux

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,840
unplugged

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,879
and um in the destination linux podcast

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
they also um picked us i think three of

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,840
the

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
four people picked um it has the best uh

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,200
distro for 2020.

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,560
so um that was very cool we are really

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
seeing a lot of popularity and

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,480
enthusiasm and i think in general

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,640
um one of the quotes from this this show

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,000
was fedora i feel like they love what

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,599
they're doing um

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
i don't know why love is capitalized

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,360
there but uh i think that and that's

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
that's it's nice that that comes through

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
i really love what i'm doing

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
i hope that you as part of fedora do and

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,400
if you are interested in fedora i hope

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,239
you find something to love

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
as well i think it's really nice that

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,480
that is coming through in what people

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,239
are seeing

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,000
as well again it seemed like it was

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,239
going to be a hard year

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
we really missed having the flock

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,920
conference in person

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
but we turned out to have a very awesome

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,640
virtual conference

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,720
using the same hop-in platform with

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,640
nest with fedora instead of flock to

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,200
fedora here's some screenshots from

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,159
people that marie all put together that

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
was really fun and successful

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,159
we did some fun things like play

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,280
minecraft here's an incredible fedora

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,720
logo built out of i assume wool

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,080
i'm not sure that was the landing spot

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,840
it was really cool and we did

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
some vr meetups we've been doing a

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,959
fedora social hour

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
every week look on

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,360
discussion.project.org to come join us

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
everybody is welcome you don't have to

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
be

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,159
um a really like highly technical

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
contributor in fact just you know come

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,159
chat hang out with the

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
the main rule of the social hour is no

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,560
talking about work

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,320
and you can talk about your day job but

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,639
not fedora work

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,880
and sometimes we do it in vr like this

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,000
but mostly we just do a video call and

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,000
just chat and things

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,120
of course big news this last year was uh

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
fedora being shipped on lenovo laptops

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,080
we hope to do

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,680
a lot more of this thing this and um

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,880
should be coming out on new

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,280
models and this time hopefully with

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,280
worldwide launch or close to world

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,479
wide launch when they come out as close

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
as we can get

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,440
um and again across more than just the

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
one model this time we'll see

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,960
that was a fun thing we did this last

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,120
year um and

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
the last session was about the community

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
outreach revamp

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
this is what's going on for the coming

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
year this is one of our big efforts the

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
whole last session was about this so i

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,479
won't

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,639
talk too much about it but this is a

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,120
really awesome

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
objective for us and important for

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
fedora because

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,160
while we really feel like we've had the

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,199
technical side of the project is going

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,560
very well

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,440
um the part of the the mind share part

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,039
of the project

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,639
there's a lot of great effort there but

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,360
it's not been very well connected

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,800
so the mindshare team and the

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
ambassadors team are working on kind of

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,440
connecting all these things together

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,720
so that things like the websites are

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
connected to the out

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
the ambassadors who are talking about

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,840
fedora and trying to you know encourage

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
people to use fedora and telling you

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,479
know

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,759
telling our stories connected into the

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,320
into the marketing and

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
all of these things all together i think

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
it's this is a really good effort and

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,479
it's going to

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
really pay off in the next year so also

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,639
of course um on the engineering

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
side fedora 34 is coming out soon

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,360
there's a poll

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
about whether you're already on it um

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
this is uh the

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,880
wallpaper it's beautiful thanks to mo

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,199
duffy for this i love it it is nice and

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,000
peaceful and i think it's kind of a good

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
reflection of where we want to get away

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,280
in the

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,560
in the coveted times a nice calm place

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,960
to relax this is the

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
uh night view of it there's a day view

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,199
as well so it's one of the night day

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,440
wallpapers it's very nice

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,240
and also this year also moe did a lot of

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,479
work on this

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
uh we are finally ready to launch the

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,039
new fedora logo

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
here are some mock-ups of it in place um

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
we can talk in more detail about why

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,120
this new logo but we wanted something

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
that

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
kind of addressed some of the issues we

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,280
were having with it functionally

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,039
while also kind of reflecting back to

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,240
the heritage of the existing logo

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,560
and not looking like something

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
completely new so this is

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,919
this is ready to go and we're going to

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,960
come up with a plan for rolling that out

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,240
over time

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,960
i think it looks really great uh

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,199
also we have an awesome intern ella

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,120
working on a fedora zine this is not the

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,560
footage magazine which is our basically

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,599
our user facing blog

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,440
but actually a literal paper zine that

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,520
will have a bunch of art and things from

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,360
the fedora community and this will be

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
shipped to some of you and we're going

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,880
to have it for handouts at conferences

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,039
and things once we have conferences

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,199
again again to show kind of what fedora

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
is all about and have something other

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
than you know cds to hand out

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
at booths something that kind of shows

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
why fedora is particularly interesting

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
it's

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,039
it's gorgeous okay

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
i promise stats and graphs of course

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,919
here is one

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,039
of them this is the fedora contributors

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
by week graph

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,039
i won't go too much into the details

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,000
here but basically the solid lines

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,160
are people who are uh continuously

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,120
active in fedora and that the higher

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,680
blue line is like drive-by contributions

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
um

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
if you look at the last year we can

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
actually see that this solid

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,000
contributions has kind of a nice trend

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,840
up which i'm glad to see i've been kind

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,879
of worried about the flat line we had

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,479
for a while there

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,160
but i think we can kind of see a

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
positive growing trend there that i hope

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,479
we can continue i still would like to

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,199
see

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,840
the green and yellow lines those are the

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,440
newer

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,039
newest contributors and the ones who've

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,280
been around for a year or so

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,400
like to see those go up more and more

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,680
but i can but i

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,599
think it's nice that we have that nice

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,560
and consistent and

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,120
the blue the drive-bys are still down

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
but that's

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
actually i think for a specific reason

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,800
which is that the wiki

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400
is now harder to edit to prevent spam so

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,840
that's a lot of the drive-bys previously

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
were that

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,520
we're going to actually add to these

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
statistics to measure some other things

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,519
like ask fedora which isn't counted

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,800
right now which i think will actually

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,039
make those things go up a little bit

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,599
more but yes

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,080
what i want to see from the outreach

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,159
group

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,040
is for these lines to be going

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,279
definitely up it's going to be cool

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,160
okay ask fedora i talked about this is

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,120
our forum

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,959
for user questions it's based around the

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,160
discourse forum software

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,480
i showed the stats for this at nest and

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,320
the basic thing here is look they're

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
growing and growing even more

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,519
so that's really good to see with a lot

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
of a lot of engagement

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,080
and a lot of discussion going on there

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,240
and a lot of solve problems

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
okay now the dinosaurs part i'm going to

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,800
show some of the stats from

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,240
fedora mirrors and the dinosaur is a

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,839
warning that some of these stats these

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
stats are observational they're like

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,760
archaeology we don't do

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,680
any invasive metrics any sort of

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,120
telemetry kind of thing so basically

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
you're just looking at the record and

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
trying to

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
discern things from that so um there may

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
be

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,560
errors uh the first thing here um this

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
is the traditional

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
thing i call it the ages of fedora which

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,720
kind of block things together the the

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,959
blocks are kind of arbitrary lumps

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,880
the important thing here is uh yeah uh

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,120
growth in the the number of systems out

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,080
there continues to go at a pretty

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,440
solid clip up and to the right so that's

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
awesome to see

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,519
um you know the spikes are up and down

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,560
of just again the dinosaurs

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,360
and just changes from time to year and

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,680
so on but

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
in general growth this is using what we

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,320
call the old counting methodology that's

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
just one

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
number of ip addresses seen every day in

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,160
the mirror network

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,200
and fedora linux is going up but it's

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
also important

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,360
one of our other outputs is apple extra

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
packages for enterprise linux that run

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
on rel

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
and on centos and on other rel derived

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,760
distributions

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,160
we count those as well and this is

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,279
an order of magnitude more use than

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,519
fedora linux

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,560
footer or linux is very important for

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,800
its own right but

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,360
one of the huge impacts as a community

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,959
we have is making the software available

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,040
to people running these enterprise

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,760
distributions which is also a very cool

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,000
thing

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,800
um and though that really continues to

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
grow

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,480
as well um we should have put it all

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,560
only if

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,920
dora is eternal slide that'll be for a

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
different talk about the

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,760
things but yes fedor fedora is eternal

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,360
and it is the source from

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,800
all of these uh uh other other packages

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,120
um so i also have a new stats

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,640
thing and um i'm these slides are not

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,560
pretty because

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
i was actually like working on making

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,720
the data gathering work and i was up

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,320
last night still working on it so i

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,880
never got around to the making it pretty

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
part

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,480
but we have a new counting mechanism

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
which uses

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,360
what every once a week the dnf

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
updates when it's looking for software

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
updates tells uh

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
tells that that machine should be

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,600
counted that week this helps us get

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,959
around some networking problems that

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,640
made it hard to tell

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,120
uh whether system there are multiple

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,600
systems at you know one house or one

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,839
sys one you know a thousand systems at

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,160
one company or just one system

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,839
or if you one person is moving around to

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
like you know this isn't happening this

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,399
year but in general

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
someone moving around to five different

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,440
coffee shops and connecting it from

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,399
every place would show up five times in

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,279
the old stats

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,560
so this gets around that um and gives us

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,480
a more accurate count

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,079
again without doing anything that's

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
personally identifiable or anything

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,920
that's user tracking so

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,760
uh this is still observational but more

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,519
accurate and it also lets us

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,160
divide up the data in more interesting

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,160
ways this slide basically just shows

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,560
that our the system is working and

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,480
uh you know for our our newer releases

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,079
we're getting data from it i think in

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
the next you know year or so

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
we'll be able to do a little more

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,639
interesting things with this but one

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,920
more interesting thing i can do

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,120
is this account actually tells it

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,720
it sends a bucket of whether it is a

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
brand new installed system

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,880
installed a week ago a month ago six

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
months ago or older than that so pretty

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,639
broad buckets so we can't really narrow

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,959
it down to specific systems but can give

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,839
us an idea of usage patterns

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,000
and you can actually use this to tell

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,480
the difference between systems that are

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,320
just installed and then become

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
permanently installed systems which is

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
actually

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,839
the red ones on the graph labeled one

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
those are systems where somebody

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,760
installed a system last week

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,760
and then this week we still see the

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,240
number of the number of systems that are

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,160
older than a week go up as opposed to

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
the purple ones which are systems

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,680
number of systems that were installed or

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,639
we saw them one time

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,639
but they don't contribute to a growing

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,880
persistent installed base

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,800
so we can actually see these ephemeral

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
systems and distinguish between them

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,800
which is kind of cool because a lot of

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,600
systems being used for ci

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,120
and build systems and tests um you know

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,399
are different from somebody who's

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,360
actually you know running a fedora

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
operating system

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,639
day to day and it's nice to be able to

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
sort those out and we can actually see

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,920
that

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,959
here this one again i apologize for not

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,040
being pretty uh

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,800
we can actually use this to break down

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
what variant people are using

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,519
this doesn't necessarily tell your

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
desktop environment because you could

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,240
install photo workstation and switch to

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,279
kde

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,399
but um it gives you

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,199
a an overall view of

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,880
of how people installed it at least and

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,399
a general idea of operating environment

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,920
you can see that about half of the

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,680
systems are using workstation

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,240
but we've got a pretty big chunk of

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,959
people using cloud that's the gray here

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
and then the generic ones which is not

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,600
labeled as any edition

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
then fedora server is again very popular

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
and then

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,079
here again in the green is containers so

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,320
fedorian containers i know for a lot of

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,040
desktop users containers seem skeptical

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,199
but

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,040
it really is an important use for the

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,480
footer operating system so that's cool

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,880
and then um kde is also a significant

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
chunk

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
of our desktop user base and then some

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,120
of the other

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,959
mate xfce and a little bit of cinnamon

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,920
there as well are also showing up

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,040
there i know there's a new i3 spin it'll

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
be interesting to see

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,320
how many people are excited by tiling

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
and

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,480
if we can get get that onto the graph um

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,839
there are there are others as well but

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,519
they don't get to the um

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,839
this is a thousand dots none of them are

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,519
big enough to rate a dot here yet

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,920
um again a lot of those are probably

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,199
installed also by you know as generic or

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,000
by installing a workstation and then

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,199
switching to another

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,800
environment um but anyways i can use

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,000
that thing i was talking about ephemeral

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,000
system so here

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,920
this is a graph of the same thing but

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
only of systems that just show up for

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,120
one week and then go away so there's

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
actually a surprising amount of

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,480
workstation

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,440
here i don't know test installs or

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
people who are building

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,680
i'm not actually sure why this is quite

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,680
so large

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,040
possibly actually when you're doing a

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,920
live install

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,199
that might show up here not sure but you

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,600
can see here that cloud

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,600
and container and server are you know

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,800
predominant overall which again

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,959
makes sense um and see a lot of

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,320
yeah those kind of test systems going

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,240
and again this is an important use for

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,199
fedora as people test the leading

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,759
edge software um and then this is okay

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,600
this is the

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,600
see i didn't talk fast enough this is

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
the opposite um this is the persistent

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
systems and it kind of again makes sense

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,199
uh we've got more more workstation

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,279
systems uh generic

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,560
that's not done with an edition these a

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,560
lot of these might be systems that were

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,560
installed in fedora 20 and upgraded ever

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,199
since and never got edition labeling on

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,720
them

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,320
um again makes sense that those are long

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,079
lasting but we also have a lot of long

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
lasting cloud systems which is kind of

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,959
cool

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,600
as well uh cloud server and again kde

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,759
and on down

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,720
all right and that was the end um let's

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,639
let's take some questions

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,079
all right there have been no questions

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,199
uh dropped into the

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,160
q a yet so i will encourage folks to do

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,600
that

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,920
um so there was a little comment about

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,839
the

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,600
the new logo and everyone seems to love

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,320
it but um can you

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,920
quickly explain some of the technical

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,199
reasons why the current logo

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,279
is hard to work with

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,440
yeah uh so one of the big things is

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,480
there is no good way to make this be a

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,680
single color

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,759
logo and you can here's on the screen a

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,720
single color and still retain the

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,040
elements of the

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,959
the logo that are important so we've

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,079
seen some pretty like the font awesome

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,480
version of it is

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,199
horrific um sometimes people get rid of

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,600
the infinity

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,240
sometimes they just make it an f um and

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
to kind of

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,839
destroy the symbolism of the logo to

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,199
render it in

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
two colors so we wanted something that

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,600
could actually be done in two colors

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,039
because there's a lot of cases where

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,079
that's important

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,679
um it also is kind of off center

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,679
a little bit which makes it hard to work

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,240
with um this doesn't show the logo type

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,640
but the

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,319
the the font we used for that was not an

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
open source font so now it is based

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,880
around an open source

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,880
font um i think the tm symbol

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
in there it doesn't actually have to be

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
in the logo

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,840
and it's kind of annoying to have it

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,360
there all the time it was

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,080
with that um and of course one of the

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,559
other things

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,799
is that it looks too much like the logo

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
of a prominent social media company and

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,840
we're tired of those

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
jokes so we wanted to move away from

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,919
that a little bit

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,960
uh we were there first this is this logo

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,440
predates

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
uh facebook using an f oh i said the

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,799
name i wasn't going to

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,919
but uh the social media company using

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,640
using that f

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
um but uh we didn't make a big deal of

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
it at the time

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,679
so we decided it'd be easier for us to

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,400
just move to something that is more

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,120
more us and there are another number of

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,039
other things

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,000
as well a question an anonymous question

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,600
in the chat

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,520
i'm planning to check out the video you

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,720
talked about etc but for someone who

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,919
hasn't tried fedora

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,919
how would you make me try it

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,080
yeah so um if you're a linux enthusiast

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,120
it's easy it's the best best one so

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
that's simple

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,760
but if you have if you're um are running

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
a you know different operating system i

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
think

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,600
the exciting thing about fedora is that

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,039
although it is technically good the

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,520
thing that's important about it

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,760
is it's an operating system that doesn't

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
belong to a company red hat sponsors

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,320
this

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,720
but it belongs to us as people and that

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,240
includes everybody who is a fedora user

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,400
not just the federal developers

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
contributors this is a thing that we

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,840
make together as

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,440
a community and share it is free for

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
everybody and it's built through all of

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,039
our effort

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,080
so it is our thing and you can be part

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,400
of a thing that is

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,160
ours and part of this community just by

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,640
running this operating system

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
and i think that's really the compelling

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
reason to

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,960
do it it is something that is worth your

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,320
time

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,960
because it is something that um is it

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,559
it's like you know owning a house versus

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,799
renting sometimes it's a hassle

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,840
but it's nice to have something that is

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,200
your own

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,799
thing that you can you know if you need

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,679
to put holes in the walls you can put

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,360
holes in the wall

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
if you want to repaint you can repaint

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
you can do things with it and in the end

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,640
it's something that just

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
you know is belongs to you and that's um

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
really what's important about open

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,600
source linux on the desktop

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
i think and you know right so the

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
questions are pouring in so we'll try

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,480
and do this rapid fire

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,559
uh could someone like me who has a test

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
system mess up your single week metrics

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,559
for example instead of installing a new

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
desktop environment on my test machine i

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,880
just reinstalled just to see how it

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,880
works out of the box

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,840
i mean if you do that every week you

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,640
will show up as

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,559
an ephemeral system and i guess that's

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,080
fine because that's what you probably

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,919
are and you know uh well maybe that's

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,360
what a lot of those ephemeral desktop

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,720
system counts actually are but if you do

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,240
it once like you know i

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,640
don't think there are enough people

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,840
doing that to really

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,919
matter and again it's not about

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,600
individual user tracking it's about

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,320
you know aggregate trends so i'm not

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,039
worried how is fedora korows doing what

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,919
do you see as the future for it

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,400
oh that's a super thing to mention here

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,760
um these this new stats do not yet

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,679
count fedora core os for iot or silver

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
blue which use a different mechanism for

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
updates

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
uh we're working on that um those will

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,919
be included um

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,080
fedora core os seems to be doing really

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,720
well as a community there's a lot of

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
energy

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,200
and liveliness around it one of the

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
things we're working on is getting that

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,039
more integrated

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,200
into the whole fedora processes overall

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,280
and we hope that that will be

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,039
labeled an official fedora edition in

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,960
fedora 35.

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:10,000
um are there plans to get fedora

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,799
more laptops uh either from lenovo or

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,159
from other

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:17,360
manufacturers yeah

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,760
definitely from lenovo i i hope that it

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,240
is

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,919
three models this time around i can't uh

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,799
i can't speak to the details

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,799
um and we would love other manufacturers

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,520
as well i don't have anything i can

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,320
talk about there at this point um well

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
slim book

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,520
in in europe also ships with fedora

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,600
workstation

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,039
on systems as well so there is at least

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,720
one other smaller one

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,480
and there are some other smaller

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,679
distributors who may be able to install

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,720
it as well but um

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,080
no huge big deals that i can talk about

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,080
at this point

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,320
is there a mobile version for fedora as

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,320
well

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,480
there is an effort to make a mobile

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
version

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
it's really hard because the hardware

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,880
changes so much

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,640
and it is so locked down this is a

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
market that microsoft decided they

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,320
couldn't

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,039
justify playing in it's a it's a really

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,640
cutthroat

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,080
and everything changes so much and the

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,200
hardware vendors

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,760
are not interested in open

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,799
um so uh there's effort but it's i don't

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,240
think it's going to be you're going to

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,840
see a headline thing

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,520
for fedora even though it's a it's a

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,120
really cool project for people

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,720
to hack on and work on and if you're

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,720
interested in that

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,919
definitely there's a mobile special

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,200
interest group that you should

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,200
check out and see we'll see if we can

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
get going all right so

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
combine two questions because they're

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
kind of related what's the

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,000
status of fedora arm and are there any

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,240
formal efforts to get

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,240
fedora running on the new apple silicon

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
um there is a there's some informal

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,760
efforts to

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,280
do it i think that's going to be a

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,679
little bit hard apple's

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,679
provided some information i think we're

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,240
probably never going to run

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,400
as well as their integrated operating

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,600
system that's their entire point

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,520
i hope to see some competitive arm

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,120
laptops coming out soon that would be

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,600
that would be fun

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,600
fedora is actually i'm i didn't show

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,559
this graph um you know most people are

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,000
running

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,919
fedora on x86 um one of the

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,480
significant places i see it they see a

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,760
lot of fedora cloud running on arm i

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,480
assume that is in the

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,360
aws graviton things that's pretty cool

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,559
to see

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,440
um but yeah so arch 64 is something that

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,159
actually

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,480
even without iot being counted like

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
shows up visibly on our graphs which is

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
exciting because we've never had a

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
non-intel

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,320
architecture even though we've supported

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,400
them for a very long time

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,240
they're always kind of lost in the noise

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,960
like again on the thousand

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
thousand squares waffle chart not not

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,279
rating a square

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,000
so arm arm rates some squares so that's

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,880
cool

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,240
um and i think that's going to be more

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,080
and more significant the people who are

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,440
working on arm in fedora are

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,159
amazing and have been uh slogging along

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,440
you know as unsung heroes for a long

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,520
time and i think they're it's

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,720
probably about about time to get sung

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,640
hit one last question um

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,880
an opinion i ran across a few times

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,880
recently is that fedora is an enterprise

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
linux and we

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,279
should should and can run ubuntu on

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,320
servers and arch on workstations

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,320
what do you have to say about that

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,440
that's weird i guess what i have to say

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,840
about that

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
now uh you know if you want an

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,279
enterprise linux

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,559
there is red hat enterprise linux which

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,400
you can run you know

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,600
now you can run in production for up to

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
16 systems

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,799
um or if you want to be something that

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,840
is

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
under a

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,320
uh where you can get the the binaries uh

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,000
just by downloading them the centos

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
stream is available like those are those

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,240
are your better

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,039
choices um than those other distros that

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,799
were mentioned

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,480
that are that you know is again things

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,960
that come from the work of fedora

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,559
directly but you could also run fedora

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,760
for those things if you wanted to but

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,320
fedora is also

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,880
awesome as an individual end user

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,600
desktop system a lot of people who run

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,200
rel in production or centos linux are

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,840
sent to a stream in production

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,200
run fedora testing or run fedora on

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,000
their desktop systems

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,279
um so yeah great great for the

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
enterprise but

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,559
super awesome for individuals as well um

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,760
i i would

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,880
i would call that um a really a silly

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
point of view don't don't listen to that

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,880
right well with that

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,320
uh we are out of time wait i want to end

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
on the positive note i want to end up

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
calling something silly give me what's

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,720
the most exciting feature

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
coming in 3434.

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,600
well i'm i'm pretty excited about the

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,799
new gnome desktop user interface i think

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,240
that's going to be

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,760
i think there's a lot it's interesting

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
how much research has gone into

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,440
developing the new ui

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,200
and i think there's going to be a little

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,960
bit of bumps because every change is

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,320
is you know something as significant as

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,840
this can um

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
you know it will rearrange somebody's

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,640
workflow but i think it is nice and

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,840
elegant

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,320
and um is a step forward for the gnome 3

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,919
ui

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,360
so i think that's that's one of the most

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,000
exciting things i think in this regard

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,159
to the desktop

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,919
at least well thank you matthew um i

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,240
there were a few more questions in the q

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,480
a

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,000
so um you can find matthew in the

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,240
discord session

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,440
uh to continue to continue questions or

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,640
i'm sure you could find his email

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
address somewhere out there on the

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,640
internet

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,039
um yeah or go

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,320
go to discussion.fedoraproject.org

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,760
that's

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,440
that'll be better than emailing me we

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,400
can have a kind of a public

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,200
public discussion yes and i miss having

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,840
a drink with

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,679
people um as commented in there we

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,720
should be going to the bar that does not

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,760
exist

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,039
right after this but oh well only only

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,919
in my mind

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,919
i'll see you over on the discord chat

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:05,840
not video i think because that's enough

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,840
