hello everyone welcome to the workshop

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
on top things we need to learn about ux

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
my colleague wendella and i would be

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,120
co-presenting today

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,440
how to unfold vox we will walk through

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,359
jacob nielsen's ux principles

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,840
and then dive into some examples and

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439
exercises to try our hands on

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,960
to apply these principles for the

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,279
products we develop

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,560
at the end we'll be happy to answer the

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,039
questions you may have

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,599
but before we get started here's a brief

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,039
discus

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,039
brief introduction about us

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
my name is shweta and i'm a part of the

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,040
rel docs team

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
as part of my job responsibilities i am

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,440
involved in understanding product

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,559
features

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
to easily explain complex things writing

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,239
end user documents

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320
reviewing and suggesting ui text i

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,879
collaborate with cross-functional teams

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719
to understand the user requirements

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,840
structure the doc contents to address

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,760
user stories

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,120
and improve usability of product

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,000
documents

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,600
outside of work i enjoy baking yoga

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,479
going to nature walks

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,799
exploring places making new friends and

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,799
getting to know different cultures

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,159
with this small introduction i will now

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,600
hand it over to my colleague wendella

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
okay hello i am wendula welcome to my

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
living room

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,640
and who i am i'm a huge fan of

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,000
minimalism in technical writing

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,560
in ux design and life in general

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
however as a mother of three kids and

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
passionate reader

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,600
books legal toys it's

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,520
all everywhere and it's hard to keep

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
minimalism around

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,720
professionally i've been in various

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
roles connected with technical writing

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
for many many years because i strongly

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,479
believe that the written word

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,479
is the king of in the world of internet

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,479
web and social media

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
and not only written words these days

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,159
it's also about

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,360
video content however

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,599
being able to express yourself precisely

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
and

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,000
without wasting people's time being able

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,280
to being able to explain complex things

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,520
easily is crucial and today

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,120
we would like to share our passion for

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,920
words with shweta

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,800
and talk about ux writing and about

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
connection

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,319
between ux writing and user experience

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
design

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,319
thank you vendula you will wonder why we

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,480
are elaborating so much on our

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,200
responsibilities and interests

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,959
if you notice a single person can play

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,519
several roles

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,040
think of many users and the roles they

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,599
would be playing

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,720
now consider if all of us plan to use a

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,360
single application

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,519
or a single product how challenging it

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,959
would be to satisfy the needs of all

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
users

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,519
as professionals our experience

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,680
interests ideas and values

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
aren't necessarily the same as that of

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,599
the users

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,760
but we still need to step up and step

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
into the shoes of users

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,760
build a product that would satisfy the

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
needs of most of the users

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
but how do we achieve this for that

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
let's

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,879
first take a look at our goals as

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,799
professionals

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,159
now irrespective of the domain and the

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,560
product that we develop

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,040
as professionals our goal is to create

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,680
and improve customer satisfaction

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,080
loyalty and of course reach business

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,080
goals

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,200
now over the number of years we

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
definitely learn

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,720
that to achieve our goal we must first

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,760
understand and meet

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,480
users needs we must develop features

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
that they haven't even asked for and of

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,599
course build

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,959
easy to use functionalities to solve the

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,799
pain points

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,840
but do we know how our products can

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,920
satisfy the needs of most of the users

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,439
this is where we need to consider user

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,879
experience

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,879
so what is user experience

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,480
user experience is an overall experience

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,599
that the user can have

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,280
with the solution a product a website

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,160
and so on it has the ability to build or

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,840
erode customer loyalty and consequently

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
the customer base

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,520
the importance of user experience

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,800
depends on the company size

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,960
and how aware the individuals are

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
fred bitcher who is a senior manager of

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,800
design at best buy

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,600
discovered ux in 1998 he mentioned

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,639
that we need to humanize technology and

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,720
heuristics help us to do that

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,240
heuristics are a practical approach to

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,040
problem solving

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
they don't dictate and are not perfect

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,680
but

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,880
they give you a base to build your work

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
on

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,479
vendula will now briefly cover what ux

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
writing is

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,800
what the usability heuristics are and we

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,479
will also take a look at how these

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
heuristics are applied

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
in some of our products

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
yes schwetta just explained what is user

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,080
experience

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,240
and i'd like to continue with ux writing

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,680
and usability heuristics

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,360
first what is ux writing ux writing is a

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,639
form of communication

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
communication between you and the

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,320
product

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
on application

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,080
ux writing is the practice of crafting

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
text

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,360
which is directly used in user

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,320
interfaces to guide users and help them

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,000
interact with their app but now let's

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,160
move to these heuristics

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,360
because i'd like to show you how it is

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,759
connected with ux writing

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,880
jacob nielsen is a web usability

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
consultant and a phd in human computer

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,919
interactions

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,960
he analyzed 249 system with usability

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,840
issues

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,400
and based on these analyses he published

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
an article with 10 general principles

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,880
for

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,080
usability interactions these principles

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,199
are now used as usability evaluation

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,319
techniques

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,319
that are applied before during and after

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,840
a product release

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,319
if these principles are not applied well

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
you are left in a situation where you

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,800
can be stressed

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,600
frustrated or angry with using your app

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,400
and we know uh this all right

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,919
this might lead to not using the product

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,120
and installing it and

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,560
certainly not recommending it

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,840
so while each of the heuristics play an

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
important role and have impact on

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,360
customers

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,800
today we will focus on these heuristics

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,520
that are connected with

00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,360
directly connected with ux writing

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:04,560
consistency error prevention

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,919
error recovery and help

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,440
and documentation let's start with

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,440
consistency and standard

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,080
because users should not make their

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
qualified guess

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,720
if two different field descriptions or

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,759
differently labeled buttons

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
are the same thing when using

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,440
terminology

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,840
please don't forget to check widely used

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,919
standards as

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,960
rfes ietf

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,599
and other standardized organization

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
because it can happen to you that you

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,120
will use

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
incorrect abbreviations acronyms or

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
terms

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,160
as an example i want to show you two

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,360
versions of one acronym

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,160
ipsec uh it happened to me that i

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,919
started automatically to use what i saw

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,960
in graphical user interface

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,800
as a technical writer i used ipsec with

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,840
capitalized s

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
but my technical corrector get back got

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,440
back to me

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,960
and said me okay there should be miner s

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,319
because

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,960
it is in rfc like that and i oh

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,840
but developers use capitalized s and i

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,879
want to

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,479
uh use the same what is in graphical

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
user interface

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,960
and she told me okay i know it's minor

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,400
change it's a small thing

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,400
uh capital i only capitalized s

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
but it can make a difference and

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,320
customers

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,159
may start to think okay is it the

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,839
technology i wanted to use or is it

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,000
something different

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,039
so we changed it throughout all

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
organizations

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,279
throughout all content and graphical

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,399
user interface

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,000
so be careful and really use

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,120
and and try to fix also these small

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,600
minor glitches

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,320
names of new features the same problem

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,200
how often your marketing department

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,880
develop new fancy name after the

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,480
application was developed

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,040
or the new feature so

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,640
graphical user command graphical user

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,680
interface and command line

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,760
they use the same old name because first

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,839
you used it in the graphical user

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,240
interface and marketing change the name

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,800
afterwards

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,600
again example that happened to me

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,880
marketing

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,080
uses very often next generation firewall

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,519
or unified street management but if

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,600
everywhere in application uh or

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,279
in graphical user interface it's just

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,959
firewall

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,760
so uh people may

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,800
have doubts if it is one product on two

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,000
or two different

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,640
especially if they are not

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,880
people from id environment they don't

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,959
know

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,920
that it is the same thing page elements

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,000
layouts

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,160
actions how often you wanted to try

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,200
different grid when your javascript

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,680
framework or a different button

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,440
but you need to stay consistent right

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,760
and use the same grid for

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,120
all screens because it is important for

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,760
consistency

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,120
you need to give users feeling that the

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,079
environment is familiar and easy to use

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
the same principle is used in ux writing

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,040
to

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,079
use the same words again and again

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,720
okay and cancel buttons really should

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
stay

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
okay and cancel no matter which

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,079
operating system

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,240
or application we use and i have one

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
example for you now

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,399
in this screenshot in the left

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,320
screenshot

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,519
you can see create network attachment

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,839
definition

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,240
and also in the left menu is network

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,160
attachment definitions

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,240
but when you want to add network

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,360
interface you see only network

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,800
definition

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,360
and level of uncertainty raises

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:13,120
is it the same thing or not

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,800
so it's really really important

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,240
to to keep the same

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,160
labels everywhere

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,880
commonly used spaces for graphical

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,880
elements

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,720
it is it simply means we should group

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
objects into logical units

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
and use blank space wisely it creates

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,120
context

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,519
and navigates users where to start and

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
how to continue in the screen and again

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,920
i have a

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,839
small example for you here you can see

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,880
quite a nice example how objects are

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,279
logically split

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,800
by blank space all file system things

00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,079
are put together everything that belongs

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,680
nfs is also grouped together

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:07,360
you clearly see uh what you can

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,079
do with kaze targets right

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,959
so blank space is important it's

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
invisible

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,320
but important part of communication with

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,320
your customers

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
commands i don't want to avoid this

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
topic

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,680
command line programs need design too

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,680
commands usually use the same pattern

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,959
and it happened to me shortly after i

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,360
joined red hat

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,440
that developers wanted from me writing

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,519
guidelines for command line help

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,480
because they used a different command

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,040
pattern and users needed extra help for

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
it

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,240
it means i had to write help

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,560
how to use help in the command line

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,519
so command line communication has rules

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,040
too

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,000
and this was a very poor design

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,800
and a bad example of wrongly used

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800
creativity

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,560
next one is error prevention

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,480
um you all probably know that

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,720
programming is about dealing with

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,200
exceptions and corner cases right

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
i know that eliminating possibility that

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,440
your application

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,639
free server stops to be working or

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,959
preventing errors if your daily work you

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,720
try to protect users from unexpected

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,399
situations

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,200
however you can go further and let users

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,560
know in advance what can happen

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,880
you can let them know what to prepare or

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,760
that they made a mistake that can be

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,839
fixed

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,800
before something really bad happens

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,600
to be able to do this you need words you

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,600
need to clearly

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,720
concisely and without jargon

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,120
explain what is going on on the screen

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,760
and what are the next steps or how to

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,040
fix an existing problems

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,519
without blaming users a user

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,839
should never feel like the error is

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,079
their fault

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,160
and please avoid language like you did

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,680
something wrong

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,680
be polite always these people are your

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,959
customers

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,839
and consider who is your target audience

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,279
it is a system admin teenager high

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
school teacher

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,440
you probably need to adjust your

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,519
language to

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,519
people who will use your applications

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
therefore because i know this is not

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,680
easy to keep

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,399
all these rules in place invite

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,160
professional writers into this process

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,880
and read guidelines for ux writing

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,959
by using right words at the right place

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,839
you can really decrease

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,839
or completely avoid users frustration

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,160
and this is a very good example how to

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,240
let users know

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,920
what to do to avoid entering a weak

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,639
password

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,440
the dialog box prevents from adding a

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,160
weak password that would be rejected by

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,040
server

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,639
and what is more it prevents users from

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,920
creating situation

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,639
that could lead to a security breach

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,839
by the way look at the picture again and

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,639
watch the color

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,000
it's green it tells you everything goes

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,279
well

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,519
uh you would see the red color when your

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,519
password has only four characters

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,320
right and but not only text

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,120
that's the important message you also

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
need

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,759
to use color font grouping

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:55,839
and using blank space and that

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,839
all should lead users to correct actions

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,680
now let's move from error prevention to

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,880
what happens

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,360
if an error appears

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,120
users start to be nervous level of

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
frustration raises

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,519
therefore the process of diagnosing and

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,480
recovering from errors

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,759
must be as simple as possible when

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,800
emotion erase we

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,680
tend to stop thinking clearly right

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,360
so all actions must be as clear as

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,519
possible

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,360
therefore technical writers can help

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,320
with minimal and precise texts

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,880
what it mean to write a minimalistic and

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,680
precise text i i will discuss later i

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,880
will show you

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:45,120
differentiate color fonts

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,880
structure and give your users

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,240
one simple path to recovery and now i

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,639
would like to show you

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,680
one great example of recognizing

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,240
diagnosing

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,480
and recovering from error this is a

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,160
short screencast from the cockpit web

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,399
console in fedora

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,400
which is a user interface for managing

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,319
system settings like storage

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,600
networking system updates

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,000
or virtual machines for example

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,039
and i absolutely love how the system

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,679
navigates me to

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,679
fix a service that didn't start working

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,799
after the system restart

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,280
so let's do it now

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,160
you can see in the overview tab which

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,480
opens just

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:34,880
after start that one service has failed

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,520
and you can see it also in the left menu

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,160
and if you click to the failed service

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,120
you will see what happened that the

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
service just

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,880
failed to start after reboot

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,640
and you can see that you can

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,400
automatically start it

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,280
so you simply click start service

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,600
and everything is green up and running

00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,600
again

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,400
so okay

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,520
next screen it's not so easy good

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,840
i'm there so

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,840
now

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:20,080
what if we do everything we can to

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,520
make application easy to use for

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,760
users but it's not enough

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,880
i still deal with the with one sentence

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,640
nobody reads documentation

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,320
right or does it is documentation

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,440
something that gives you additional

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,840
value and if so

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
where is the right place for

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,400
documentation and how it should look

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,320
like

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,600
so first documentation must be easily

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,799
accessible

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,039
days of long pdfs and printing books

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,160
are definitely over documentation must

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,120
be online

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,000
and findable by search engines and

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,480
ideally

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,120
documentation should be accessible

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,280
directly from your application

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,559
in form of tooltips or some

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,160
short explanations and learn more links

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,039
that takes you directly to the

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,039
documentation

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,720
important note is what can be explained

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,600
in graphical user

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,120
interface explain in graphical user

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,160
interface

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,520
don't rely on documentation a graphical

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,679
user interface

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,640
should be designed in a way that simple

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,320
concepts are

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,720
understandable at the first side however

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,600
especially if the topic's a topic is

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
complex

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,000
and almost everything is complex in the

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,440
linux server worldwide

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,039
networking storage clusters containers

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,480
development tools this all

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,799
can be pretty complex so it's important

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
to

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
write and offer high quality

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,799
documentation

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,600
that is accessible to everyone and

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,600
visible

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,640
at the right places in your product

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,799
and i have again example from the fedora

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,280
web console

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,080
we edit help button to the upper right

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
corner

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
that takes you to the overall

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,640
documentation

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,000
but also in some specific cases we added

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,360
question mark button and

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,720
you can open it read small

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,000
overview and click learn more link

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,200
that takes you to the topic based

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,360
and oriented documentation so it's

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,840
connected it opens directly article

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,840
specifically written for bond settings

00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,320
okay perfect and before i

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,919
give a word back to schwetta i'd like

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:07,039
to define more or explain more what i

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,159
meant by simple concise and minimalistic

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,400
text

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,960
schwetta prepared great exercises for

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,840
you therefore i need to give you some

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,280
basics

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:21,840
of using special form of english we as

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,080
technical writers and ux writers use

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,400
the most important part is sentence

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,280
structure it must be as simple as

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,840
possible

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,679
each word in the sentence increases

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,480
complexity and decreases

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,480
good user experience and i have some

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,080
examples for you

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,280
data feeds dogs subject

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,200
verb object or

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:51,280
from technical writing the cockpit web

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,280
console manages system settings

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,360
another rule computers doesn't know past

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:03,039
and future so please use present

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,159
tense as much as you can

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,440
use imperative imperative starts with

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,240
verb

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,240
examples

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,200
enter the host name of the identity

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,799
management system

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,679
or click the edit button

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,159
or avoid passwords that are easy to

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,840
guess

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,840
on or used on other websites

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,840
ambiguity that's the problem uh if you

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,880
can

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,799
avoid adjectives and adverbs

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:43,120
because adjectives and adverbs bring

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:46,799
ambiguity into text if i use words small

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:51,360
how small it is i don't know precisely

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:54,880
or enough free space on the hard drive

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,159
but it's enough how much is enough

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:03,440
so use data facts

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,440
and don't use adjectives and adverbs

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,919
if you see complex sentence structure if

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,000
you use complex sentence structure user

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,840
experience will not be good for

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,400
non-native speakers

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,080
and if you translate your products you

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,600
will increase possibility of

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,480
incorrect translations so keep

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,360
if you see a la sentence throughout

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,760
three lines of text it definitely should

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,520
you should break it into into smaller

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,520
sentences shorter sentences

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,960
repeat the same words and phrases

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,520
this is not a school essay where you

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,799
must

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,000
use 10 different verbs with the same

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,720
meaning

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
on contrary you need to use the same

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,840
verb

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,919
again and again throughout the entire

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,279
application

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,279
and okay this was the last rule i hope i

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,080
shared with you something new

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,440
and let's ask shivetta now for some real

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,039
life examples

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,039
and exercises

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,880
thank you angela for introducing the

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,880
usability heuristics

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,200
and for showing us some live examples

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,279
that relate to the usability heuristics

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
it is also great to know how teams can

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,159
work with the technical writers

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,320
to build a positive user experience here

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,039
are a few additional examples of some

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,279
work on ui text and error messages

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,799
that show how writers have helped to

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,799
improve the usability

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,360
and have contributed to positive user

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,360
experience

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,039
next slide

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,400
this is a screen from real web console

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,880
commonly known as cockpit

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,559
which is the management ui from rel

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,720
systems

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,799
now the user x function on this screen

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,120
is to add a new host

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,840
to the web console so that the users can

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,080
start managing it

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,120
what happens is a user logs into the web

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,960
console and proceeds to add a host

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,720
now when we were reviewing the original

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,440
screen we noticed

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,080
that one there is no helper text so a

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,640
user may

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,679
be unsure of which user name is expected

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,240
here

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,640
should he enter an admin username or

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,880
just the login username

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,679
second for the host to be added the

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,240
input was

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,039
valid in multiple formats like ip

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,159
address

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,120
hostname alias name or a unique resource

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,960
identifier for the ssh destination

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,320
but none of this was clear without the

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,320
helper text

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,200
a writer could step into the shoes of a

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,679
user and identify these gaps

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:47,039
and at the same time suggest proper text

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,039
let's take another example

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,080
next slide

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
this is another example from rel web

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,919
console

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,240
this time an error message i'm sure

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,440
most of us would feel what's wrong with

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,159
the original message

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,240
and this feeling is perfectly fine we

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,720
might feel that because we assume that

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
users

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,400
already know that certain things that we

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,960
are aware of

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,200
but that may not be the case like in

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,120
this case the original message said

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,200
not connected to the host and the

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,360
assumption here was the user would know

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
that the login has failed

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,440
now there's a difference between not

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,520
connected and login failed

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,760
for not being connected the reason could

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,799
be like the machine is not powered on

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,200
or the network is down but the case here

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,520
was

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,200
the web console wasn't able to login to

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,919
a particular host

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,000
and the reason was when the host was

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,480
added to the web console

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
the user had not specified the ssh key

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,400
for auto login

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,039
or maybe the key was unauthorized or

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,240
maybe it was password protected

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,600
also as the very next step to get out of

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,640
this situation

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,240
is to manually log in but instead the

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,880
original message said

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,440
you may want to set up your ssh keys

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,600
which leaves the user clueless

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,559
the user would not know how can that be

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,279
done

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,000
is it required to exit the console set

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,880
up an ssh key and then get back

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,679
or will this screen redirect him or her

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,080
to create an ssh key

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,840
now a writer could spot these gaps and

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,679
could suggest a better message and

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,960
that's because the writer was the first

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,039
user

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,159
with the writing skills the writer was

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,360
able to suggest

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,279
a better error message i hope these

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,080
examples gave you some insight

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,600
on how a ui can be improved for better

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,559
user experience

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,720
one when one steps into user shoes and

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,480
how writers can partner with you

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,480
for improved ui text

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,039
now that we have a brief background

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,880
about what heuristics are

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,279
how they influence the usability of a

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,200
product and how writers can help to

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,120
improve user experience

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,360
let's try our hands on some quick

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,720
exercises to have some fun-filled

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,399
learning

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,799
we will have five minutes for each

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,399
exercise and at the end of five minutes

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,120
a buzzer will blow

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,840
we can share our answers in the chat so

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,840
let's get started

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,520
this is a tool tip that you see when you

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,640
click the question mark

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,679
next to the lung type this tool tip is

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,679
so large

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,799
that you cannot see the original dialog

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,880
box

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,320
the content of the tooltip is also not

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,480
helpful

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,840
the tooltip is supposed to help the user

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,320
pick a lun type for computer storage

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,520
you need to rewrite the tooltip to make

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,320
it shorter

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,399
and useful your time starts now

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,159
you can drop your answers in the chat

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,159
and we will monitor your answers

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:04,480
two questions in the q a section

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,880
ah there is yeah

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,880
okay

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,399
oh it's about lightening talks

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,480
yeah i don't think it's related to this

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,679
workshop

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,520
yeah yeah and i don't know how

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,039
rising talks work unfortunately

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,679
darker seems to have answered that

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,679
question there

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,480
if you have two tasks here even on

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:39,760
session

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,760
if you go to session tab ah session

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,240
other perhaps some automated ways to

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,320
detect ux

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,880
flows in an interface or a document

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,919
going through hundreds of pages of ducks

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
or parsing

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,919
an interface piece by piece seems rather

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,440
ineffective

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,559
wow that is great questions

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,480
automative two ways to detective

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,679
explores

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,440
i don't know about anything i i remember

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,559
we wanted to take screenshot

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,159
new screenshots from graphical user

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,080
interface automatically and

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,520
automatically update screenshots in

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,880
documentation

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,679
but that was the last that was the only

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,240
thing

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:34,159
i've ever heard something automated

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,760
actually we at red hat have ux

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,120
researchers and they take

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,840
manually our graphical user interfaces

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,679
and documentation to our customers

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,840
and evaluate but something automatic

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,240
no i don't know about anything schwetta

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,320
would you know

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,390
not really vandalia i need to take a

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,479
look at it give some thought

00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,479
[Music]

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:06,480
and we have 30 seconds so vladimir

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,360
i read your question example with the

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,120
service i

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,159
read it as controls should be linked

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,880
from places that mention or

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,559
need them and information and controls

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,120
for making a decision

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,679
should be visible together is that right

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,720
yes

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,440
it is right and also in the screen you

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,360
can see

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,360
oh oh okay

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,000
i uh you i can see what happened

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,039
and i can see the next steps i can tell

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,120
next step

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:43,200
i can take so i don't see okay er

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,080
what to do and now i need you to go to

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,519
the documentation and find how to fix it

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,159
but there's always hint how to continue

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,440
and that's what i like i immediately

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,600
knew what to do

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,440
and didn't feel frustrated so

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,960
by the way it happens to me with the

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,760
same

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,440
with the same service after each restart

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,200
of my computer

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:13,760
so i should find some permanent solution

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,200
i guess so if anyone has the answers

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,399
ready

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,760
can you put them in the chat that will

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,640
be nice to see some

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,640
possible answers

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,440
okay no one no one

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:40,240
okay are we are we going to tell them

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,320
this is the correct answer okay let's go

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,600
considering the time i think we need to

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,960
yeah we have

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,080
five minutes left okay perfect

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,279
okay so here's one possible way to

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,440
rewrite this tooltip and in this version

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,440
all the explanations begin with a verb

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,760
and are parallel with each other

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,840
we have simplified the wording and have

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,399
left out some of the details

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,559
also because the tooltip is much shorter

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,000
you can see a lot more of the dialog box

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,480
behind it

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,480
now let's quickly jump into exercise two

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,960
and here's the dialog box again from

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,080
real web console

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,440
now what you need to do is you need to

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,240
think if this text

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,679
on the screen is intuitive can you spot

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,159
any changes required

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,039
and suggest some improvements your time

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,679
starts again

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,360
now i think we'll have to cut down on

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,000
the time when you left for this exercise

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,440
because we

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,240
just had five minutes let's let's show

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
the results

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,039
if you don't mind guys we can play this

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,880
exercise later on but

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,600
considering the time i think we can jump

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,159
to the answer right now

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,679
so as you see the proposed changes again

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,840
use action verbs

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,799
which make it fairly simple for the user

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,600
to understand

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,440
what action needs to be performed also

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,960
in the proposed text the label for the

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,359
checkbox is removed

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
because there is just one checkbox we

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,760
don't need a label to it

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,480
additionally a label automatic login

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,560
would have checkboxes like yes or no

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,560
indicating whether or not does the user

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,480
want to set automatic login

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,560
but in this case the purpose is to

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,159
generate and authorize an ssh key for

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,560
auto login

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,879
the text in the grey box appears only if

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,520
a user selects the check box

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,560
so that proposed text is better phrased

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,560
to simplify

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,560
how would the web console function

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,679
with this exercise we come to the end of

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,280
this workshop today

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,839
thank you all for participating in the

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,520
workshop we hope you have enjoyed it

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,119
we look forward to working with you to

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,520
improve the user experience

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,280
for the products we develop just to

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,359
summarize and to note a couple of

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,599
takeaways from this workshop

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,599
always apply usability heuristics to

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,680
improve user experience

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,960
partner with your writing buddies for ui

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,760
text error messages

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,000
tool tips and so on and always use

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,359
pattern fly guidelines to craft the ui

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,960
text

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,280
we would be also happy to have you

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,119
tomorrow at our talk on giving user

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,359
interfaces a voice

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,680
there we will be talking about our

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,440
collaboration with the uxd team

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,760
and share some examples from our

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,839
projects where this collaboration led

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,839
