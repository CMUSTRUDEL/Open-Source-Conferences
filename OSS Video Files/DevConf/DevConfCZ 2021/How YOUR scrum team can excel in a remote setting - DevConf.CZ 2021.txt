Title: How YOUR scrum team can excel in a remote setting - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-14
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speakers: Hina Popal, Sarah Finn

This session will go over how to make your scrum process friendly for a remote setting. Scrum thrives in settings where everyone is co-located but in the digital world we can not assume that teams working in the same office is the standard. How can Scrum work for your team when its now remote? Its simple! Tailoring the processes to meet your teams needs will allow you to continue working without reinventing the entire wheel. In this talk we will go over what our new remote norm looks like, what scrum is, steps to consider when tailoring, and tips on how to tailor some of the process based off of real world experiences working with remote scrum teams.

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,360
unfortunately he has

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,519
no technical difficulties and but

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,920
hopefully she can join later on and if

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
not

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,840
um in the chat channel uh later on today

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,039
and so ideally we would love to be

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
presenting this

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
in brno um in that beautiful city that i

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,519
got to visit

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
um last year and but unfortunately

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,679
that's not the case

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,239
um this year but um fingers crossed next

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,440
year

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,920
we'll get back there um so yeah so the

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
topic

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,079
we're going to talk about today is um i

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,840
very much uh around what you're probably

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,960
experiencing yourselves and your own

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,719
kind of teams

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,039
whether you're working scrum with your

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,480
working kanban or customized

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,600
uh process for your team it's trying to

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
adapt that

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,039
into a remote setting it can be quite

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,760
challenging and

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,760
myself and hina um have kind of captured

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,960
a few tips along the way over the last

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,119
kind of couple years

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
and especially in the last 12 months

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,560
that we were hoping to share with you

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,400
and um to hopefully help you

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,600
unblock any things or any challenges

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,920
that you might have

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,720
uh you might be experiencing um at this

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,479
time

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
i'm sure you have lots of tips

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,119
yourselves around things that are

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
working for you

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,040
and so be great to hear those as well

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
you can add them to the chat as we kind

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
of go through the presentation

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,479
and or as i said we can have a chat

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
about it later on so we'd love to

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,360
hear from yourselves as well in what's

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
working for you and what's not

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,360
so remote working remotely can look very

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,479
different

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,479
uh for for people and so it could mean

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,840
you know that you're working in a city

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,000
that has and

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
has an office but you've decided to work

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
uh remotely that's a

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,600
personal choice for you or it might be

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,399
um that you're you're working in

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,840
location

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
and all your other colleagues are

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
working at different locations across

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,119
the globe as well

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,360
and so remote can be quite different for

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,880
lots of different um lots of different

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,959
people

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,920
um if anyone uh knows of how we can all

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
work remotely

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,920
from this gorgeous island uh with wi-fi

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
please let us know

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
and i'll be on a plane tomorrow

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,680
so let's just um jump back a little bit

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,720
so i can introduce myself and a bit more

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,160
so my name is sarah finn i am a senior

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,200
agile practitioner

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,319
and at red hat and under the agile

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
practice team

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,760
and what that means really is that i

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,599
help um

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,920
teams kind of come together to have

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
discussions around how best to work

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,959
together

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,599
and to try and ask them to experiment

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,160
with um agile techniques and tools

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
and to allow them to evolve more and

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
continuously improve

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,959
so it's just really around creating that

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
space and having someone there

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
supporting me

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
in finding um a better way of working

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
that you enjoy

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,800
and and also that that's delivering

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,519
value and

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
for your users as well i'm currently

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,760
working with the community

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,080
platform engineering team and they're

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,560
um at the forefront of the support for

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,959
the centos and fedora communities

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
and they're an absolute amazing bunch i

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920

brilliant brilliant skills and and uh

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,480
work ethic as well they're amazing um

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
anyways for your time

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
and i help out with the agile and devops

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,799
community

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
in red hat too so again creating kind of

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
safe spaces

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,519
um for teams within red hat and rights

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,920
from teams to join the agile and devops

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,519
and community to share what their

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,200
experiences have been

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,560
and what they're trying out what

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,720
experiments they're trying

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
and learning from others as well so it's

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,360
a pretty cool place to be

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,720
and we have great fun in doing it i'll

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
introduce hina

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,319
hina is my amazing colleague and i

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,560
absolutely

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,760
am mad about she's she's great and i'm

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,439
sure lots of you have

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,040
have experience working with hina she's

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,760
been around had a long time

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,439
and she is a principal agile

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,199
practitioner and she's working with

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,680
rhb and cnp team unfortunately i

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,239
actually

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,400
don't know what that breakdown is but um

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,440
you might in the chat pop that in there

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,120
and so hina has helped put all these

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,639
sites together with me

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,280
and and she's she's she's absolutely

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,880
brilliant she's great

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,360
okay so if you're not um familiar

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,000
uh with scrum within a working

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,720
environment

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,919
the first vision that might come to you

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,919
is maybe a strong

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,880
team in a rugby setting and so rugby is

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,720
a sport

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,560
that's played kind of across across the

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,759
world but it's very popular

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,280
um in the uk ireland and new zealand

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,759
they're like the top team

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,440
uh south africa and a lot of other lots

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,199
of other places as well

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,880
um but scrum is is a part of play

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,000
within rugby and so if um if a ball goes

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
out of play or there's been

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,280
a foul um and you need to restart play

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
they do that you're using a scrum

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,800
technique

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,160
so both teams come together on either

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,360
side

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
and a ball a rubbie ball is popped into

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,039
the into the middle

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
and each team need to work together as

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,280
one unit

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,919
to try and get that ball

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
uh get that ball for their advantage so

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,280
they're working towards that one goal

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,919
with that one vision

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,000
to and gain that ball to achieve their

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,400
advantage and hopefully score

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
um a winning try or a point

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,039
when we look at and scrum in a work

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,960
environment

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,520
it's usually referring to one of the

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,319
most popular agile frameworks

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,479
and that organizations adopt and teams

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,199
adopt to help them work

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,319
so when the scrum framework guides and

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,720
rules were drafted

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
people generally worked in co-located

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
environment

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,840
with very few if any employees work

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,840
remotely

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,639
a scrum team will generally look like

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,720
this all team members co-located

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
with an actual physical scrum board to

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
visualize

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,600
gather around and interact with going

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,720
mad with stickies

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
the scrum guide regarding ceremonies

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
works really well

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,600
um in this environment so it provides

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,560
opportunities to regularly think with

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
your team

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,160
to plan to touch base to keep track on

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,199
progress

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
to review gain feedback to reflect and

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,759
improve

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,479
so it works really well in that

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,160
environment most if not all

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,080
teams found these enjoyable meetings and

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
when you're in a co-located environment

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,199
you might go off into

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
a meeting room for four hours for your

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,199
planning session but a lot of that was a

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,280
social aspect of that too

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,199
and where you had your kind of general

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,039
kind of chit chat conversations

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,639
the scrum master might bring in some

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,319
sweets or donuts or

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,080
whatever it might be so it was a real

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,560
kind of event that was happening and

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
something that people look forward to

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,840
and everyone left those um ceremonies

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,639
with a clear understanding of next steps

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,560
their action items and feelings of

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,560
achievement for their collective effort

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
was delivered to their users

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,639
they also enjoyed the opportunity to

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,560
gain and provide feedback to ensure they

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,560
delivered an item of value

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
and to address any pay points with their

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,120
process so they really

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,759
valued those things together they really

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
saw

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,560
um their purpose and how would it help

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
them achieve success and also

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
and allow them to kind of feel

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,479
connection with uh with the team

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,360
and the overall goal overall goal

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,879
but with all good in the world it might

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
seem like it was

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
but only hiring talent to work at one

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
location

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,479
where teams and organizations limiting

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,960
their potential

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,520
yes they they kind of were only only

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,840
hiring someone from from one location

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,199
were they missing key skills or the

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,400
opportunity to learn

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,479
key skills from others absolutely and

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
were they truly delivering the best

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,199
product or service to their users

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,199
maybe they absolutely could have had

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,080
that skill and talent within their one

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,319
location

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,160
but they definitely missed out on other

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,120
opportunities to live and to deliver

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,120
even more value

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
so teams and organizations started to

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,599
see the gap

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,240
the potential to learn grow and prosper

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,640
to explore new markets new skills was

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,800
too big of an opportunity to ignore

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,800
when online tools emerged to help with

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,040
connection communication

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,839
and planning the opportunity to deliver

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,760
more value

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,680
grew even more and more so today

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,240
and maybe you know it could be just

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,720
through covert but all across the globe

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,440
this is what a strong team looks like

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,279
we're all

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,839
on our um google hangouts our blue jeans

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,920
or zoom whatever whatever tool you use

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
and we're all coming together in this

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,360
brady bunch

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,760
um window to to collaborate together

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,760
so we still have our vision we still

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
have our goals our plans

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,000
and in theory the only thing that we've

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,120
changed is swapping out in-person

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,399
discussions

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,720
physical visual boards and co-located

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
desks to online tools that enable us to

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
work together

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,920
and in fairness there's perks to that

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,560
too we get to work

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,399
in our cozy work pants some days we have

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,800
a constant stream of coffee

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,160
and just to keep us on our toes we have

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,000
the unpredictability of interruptions

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,080
but as we've all experienced it has

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,680
never been as straightforward as that so

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,519
say for example

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,600
planning for your two-week sprint in a

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,160
co-located room for four hours with

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,880
plenty of breaks

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,880
having a chat um is one thing and trying

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,079
to replicate that online to achieve the

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
same valuable

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,600
outcome of alignment and shared

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,920
understanding

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,120
while engaging remotely with your team

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,040
is something different

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,360
all together okay and over to you hina

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,000
hi i didn't want to chime in until you

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,440
recognized i was here

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,680
for good to have you here so um

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
as we see there are plenty of remote

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,079
challenges

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,760
and this is one of them um

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
just a quick introduction my name is

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
hina i

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,279
work at red hat and i'm an agile

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,000
practitioner so now

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,680
this was the perfect way to enter into

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,560
this presentation

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,079
because we pulled a bunch of people and

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,480
we asked them

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,240
hey tell us what is challenging when

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,000
working in remote

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,760
settings and there were so many common

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,600
patterns across the board

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,360
one if you work for a globally

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,040
distributed company

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,680
on echo hold on one second how about now

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
less echo

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,320
okay i think less echo um

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
so yeah if you work for a globally

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,240
distributed company

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,480
then there is um

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,079
the time zone challenge right you can

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,760
work with people that are

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,320
in india and in california and

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,279
what happens is maybe you have one to

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,880
two hours

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,560
a day you can meet and that's it

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,680
so all of the meetings that you needed

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,120
to do as a team as a program etc

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,480
they're jammed into this golden hour and

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,440
you will constantly be busy

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,200
the others are the beauty of meeting

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,240
tetris

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,079
as you go into the setting you have so

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,120
many meetings right you want to schedule

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,440
meetings so for example if i wanted to

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,839
just chat with my colleague

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
the level of effort it'll take me to

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
find a meeting

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,959
find a time that'll fit with more than

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,920
two colleagues

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,440
it is like playing a game of tetris but

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
you're not playing a game of tetris at

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,839
the bottom

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,079
you're playing a game of tetris when

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,680
you've got about four lines left

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,959
and you have to go and get the shapes

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,399
that you need

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,200
just so it can decrease

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
last uh one of the last and most

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,920
challenging things i believe

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,959
is meeting fatigue we're human beings

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,920
we cannot be sitting behind our computer

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,760
for six seven eight hours a day even

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,160
after three or four hours

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,800
you're not meant to be staring at a

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,560
screen and it's exhausting

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,399
so if you feel tired by the end of the

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,320
day and

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
the benefit of feeling tired by the end

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,600
of the day and being in meetings

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,040
is you also feel like you didn't

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
accomplish anything

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
meetings are work you're tired from

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,120
meeting fatigue

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
and you also probably are beating

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,399
yourself up

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,440
because you didn't get to you know

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,639
getting that pr

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,680
in making that presentation

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,800
testing or verifying that bz because

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,639
you had meetings all day um the fatigue

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,760
is real

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,959
and last but not least the value of all

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,360
of this

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,160
it's hard to see the value of the work

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
you're doing

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,320
when you're sitting behind a screen you

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,639
have maybe cards and jira

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
uh bugzillas trello cards it doesn't

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,240
matter

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,079
some kind of tracking tool or to-do list

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,279
but you're very focused on your

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,519
individual item

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,040
it's not the same when you're in an

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
office and you can see

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,519
pictures on the wall you can see white

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,959
boards with diagrams

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,519
hear what your colleagues are talking

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,000
about your walls are not going to tell

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,199
you what the strategy of your prs are

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,639
your walls are not going to tell you

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,320
what the customer solution that you're

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,240
working on to solve is

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,760
so that being said it's really difficult

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
in a remote setting

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,519
unless you go out of your way or you

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,440
build it into your system to see the

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,680
value of the work that you're doing

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,720
that doesn't negate that there's value

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,560
it just means that

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,360
it's really tough to see it so

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,440
let's talk a little bit more on the next

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,279
slide

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,560
scrum can be your friend and i

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,320
as a agile practitioner people that i

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,920
have worked with that didn't really like

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
scrum in the beginning

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,000
they gave us some of their own insights

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,519
um

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
i like to call him the beetle of

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,160
containers dan walsh

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,160
he uh highlighted that scrum helped

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
coordinate and collaborate between

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,079
distributed teams

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,040
helped force people to keep on track and

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,279
focus on what the team needed to succeed

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,839
and also steve milner or some of you

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,000
might know him as ash crow

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,160
made a fantastic point that there's no

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,079
such thing as the perfect process

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,760
so we're not here to tell you that scrum

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
is the best in a remote setting you

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,360
scrum

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,920
absolutely not but agile and scrum

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,079
helped get people closer to the ideal

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
because it's an iterative approach where

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,760
you're supposed to experiment and we'll

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,399
talk a little bit about that in the next

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,399
few slides

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,760
so how can we help your teams how can

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,600
you help your teams address

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,040
this well first

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,360
um there might be a little bit lag

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,000
so you want to focus on the best ways to

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,600
collaborate and deliver

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,040
what does that mean right those are

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
buzzwords

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
really if you want to focus on that

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
you're looking at what you're doing

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,600
today

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,160
and there's no secret here you're just

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,759
saying all right so how are we working

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,079
you'll figure out the gaps as you go

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
because when you're clenching your jaw

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,680
doing something

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,480
and it's not just clenching your jaw

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,720
because

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,480
it's an instant there's repetitive

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,560
patterns that stress you out

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
that make you think oh why are we doing

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,639
this again why are we in the meeting

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,759
again

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,040
why am i wasting my time as you have

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,600
those reactions

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
if your brain hurts if your body is

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
tensing

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,880
listen so you're looking at it and

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,079
you're listening and you're

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,120
ask yourself why am i tensing up what is

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,079
what is the reason for this it might be

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
because

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,519
you don't find value in the way you're

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,639
doing things then there might be an

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,040
easier way

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,360
that you haven't talked about and so the

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,680
next step is then saying hey

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
every time we have these standups or

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,279
every time we have this

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,440
sprint planning it's a waste of my time

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,279
there's extreme merit in saying that

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,800
it's if it's a waste of your time it

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,079
might be a waste of the rest of the

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,639
team's time

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,880
but the idea of process stops them the

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,920
idea of oh we agreed to do scrum we're a

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,839
scrum team

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,399
so we can't change it this is how scrum

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,920
does things that stops you from actually

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,720
saying

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,680
i don't care what scrum says scrum is

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
there to help us

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,280
so if it's not helping us let's talk

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,919
about it and figure out a way to change

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,240
it

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,319
and so that's where your response goes

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,679
will you actually find something

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,280
that will fix the problem no but if you

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
experiment eventually you'll find

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
something that's better

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,000
or you'll just have to agree this is

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
painful either we

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,199
keep doing it because the value is worth

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,039
it or we stop

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
because it's a waste of our time

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,120
i think that's a really good really good

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,720
point for

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,720
hina and especially around that

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
listening side of things

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,000
so let's not just accept to suppose the

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,799
status quo

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,280
or this is how scrum should be run even

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
though

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,679
i'm sitting here you know clenching or

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,840
my brain is right or not seeing the

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,840
value of meetings it's to question

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,039
you know things that we need to change

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,120
and to hopefully

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,679
um improve things and also to improve

00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:01,840
our joy working together as well

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,840
so thanks for sharing that

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,240
all right um so

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,160
i unfortunately did not hear sarah uh

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,080
oh actually it's because i tried to

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
avoid an echo

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,559
remote challenges will come and be a

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,440
repeated pattern in this talk today

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,080
so first one of the worst connotations

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
with scrum

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,280
is that there are too many meetings and

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,200
there is truth in that right because

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,039
you're not just having your team scrum

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,760
ceremonies you're having program

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,520
meetings design meetings calls

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,679
one-on-ones one-on-ones with your

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,440
manager and you can't tell your manager

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
hey manager i'm so tired of having

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,600
meetings

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
you're the one i don't want to talk to

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,000
this week so

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,520
no don't do that definitely meet with

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
your manager they're there to help you

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,840
progress

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,200
but their meetings they they do

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,200
tie people up in one place they

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,640
are gonna leave someone out in remote

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,559
teams for example

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,400
your colleagues should not sacrifice

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,720
dinner time with their family

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,600
you should not have to take a four

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,240
o'clock

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,080
in the morning meeting every day right

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,400
if there's purpose and value and you

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,039
agree and it's maybe like a

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,559
quarterly thing that that's different

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,160
but if it's a scrum ceremony or

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,240
repetitive meeting

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,000
your colleagues they can sit this one

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,919
out right

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,080
so if you're gonna have those meetings

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,160
you want

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,919
and so there's a that question you ask

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,840
is what is the value

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,120
of having this meeting what's the

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,240
purpose of it

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,559
why are we doing this and is it leaving

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,880
us

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,200
in a place that's better to collaborate

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,240
and do the work that we set out to do

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,720
right so what are our tips here

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,799
by the way those were very wise words

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,240
from brian stinson on the left

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,480
feel free to take some time and read

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,799
these we'll tweet these out the slides

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,799
so first have your meetings with purpose

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,400
i actually recommend all of you at the

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,360
end of devconf take a look at your

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
calendars

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,640
and rank your meetings you can

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
prioritize them or color

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,400
green color yellow whatever makes you

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,480
feel good and

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,679
see what meetings you find value out of

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,960
determine if

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,039
hey the meeting is not valuable

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,400
can i async this why are we having a

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,440
meeting in the first place

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,640
is it too much that we're doing and if

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,320
the answer is yes

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,919
bring that to your team your team should

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,919
be there to listen

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,440
they should be there to say yeah we

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,480
actually don't find the value

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
or maybe you aren't aware of certain

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,760
value

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,760
that the meeting was bringing so that

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,520
conversation is really important

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,120
and it's okay to have those

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,840
conversations because you should trust

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,480
each other to have that safe space

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,320
then prioritize your scrum meetings the

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,840
ones that you're doing the ones that

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,559
you're saying hey this is how we're

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,039
doing it

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,000
this is the intention of the meeting um

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,520
we understand

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
and we know that this is going to help

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,320
us show up there

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,000
that might mean hey i can't make it my

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,919
team has backlog grooming or

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,480
uh refinement or hey we have

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,840
um i don't even want to say daily

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,159
because we're going to tell you

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,760
you might not have to do daily standups

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,080
uh in a few slides

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,039
so maybe it's like our weekly video

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,000
stand up

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,760
i can't make this meeting that's okay

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,600
and that's very much recommended because

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,320
you've committed to your team

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,360
and you know that the way that you're

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,480
working together

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,000
is going to help you meet your goals

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,159
that there's a difference than not

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,080
showing up once in a while

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,000
because maybe you had to go to the

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,919
dentist maybe you really did have to

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,200
jump into another meeting

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,919
but if it's a regular occurrence

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,000
then it's you're not going to have value

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,760
in these meetings at all

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,159
additionally for the meetings where

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,080
everyone doesn't need to attend

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,159
we all love our program meetings we all

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
love our design discussions we all love

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,600
them

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
we all love this open decision the open

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,880
uh

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
model but you don't always need to be

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,200
there every step of the way

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,280
you should be aware so send someone to

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,520
go ahead and represent you

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,880
have that awareness and whatever

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,799
information you missed

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,640
that representative will share that back

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,200
to you or there will be an

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,559
email one of our favorites summary to

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,159
tell you what you missed

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,720
so if you think that there's too many of

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,440
us

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,640
why do we need this let's say as a

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,480
virtualization team

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,400
why does the entire virtualization team

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,720
need to show up to this meeting

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,960
maybe they don't and then ask someone

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,360
you can even ask a rotating someone

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,919
to show up and be the voice of the team

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,520
and then come back

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:48,559
so the devil's advocate to this one is

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,880
meetings can be your friend

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,640
there's a prerequisite which is clean up

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
your meeting calendars

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,159
only make sure that there's value in

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,280
your calendar because you're

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,640
you're this is what your job is right

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,360
your eight hours hopefully less if more

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,960
let's carve it out to less that is time

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,240
that you're getting paid for or you're

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
dedicating

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,200
so clean up your calendars and then make

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,360
meetings your friend

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
it is more effective to have a meeting

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,559
and talk instead of writing comments in

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,559
an issue tracker

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,960
if i were in devconf in a room with you

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,320
all this is the time where i would ask

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,880
how many people have had a conversation

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
that solved a problem when they've had

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
maybe

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
comments in bugzilla floating around for

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,679
three weeks

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
a month sometimes six months because you

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,760
forgot

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,840
the issue existed and i'm sure

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
at least a fourth of you i want to say

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,640
at least half of you

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,320
have had those kinds of interactions

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,480
or comments on jira half of the time

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,480
those comments those bugzilla comments

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,159
those threads those emails

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,919
end up in a 15 minute meeting anyway um

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,240
but it is the easiest trap

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,600
to get into that comment and when you're

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,360
in time zones right

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,120
i'm talking to my colleague in india so

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,320
i have to wait every day for one

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,520
line responses just figure it out in a

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,320
15-minute meeting

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,919
or a 5-minute google hangout ping them

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,039
say hey let's jump on a call and just

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,720
chat real quick

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:26,320
instead of waiting for the responses

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,159
um you can you can change your stand up

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,279
sometimes to have

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,039
conversations and that way you have an

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,600
open place to talk about fire

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,960
fighting to talk about strategy design

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,159
issues

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,480
and um additionally

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,520
sometimes your walls they're not always

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,440
your friends

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,279
if they're speaking back to you it's

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,039
probably because you need some human

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,320
interaction

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:55,520
right so my wall is gray how is your day

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,600
its response is always gray

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,360
when the conversation changes i know i

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,640
should go to the grocery store or i

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,600
should call a friend

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,320
because i need other interaction and

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,480
it's okay

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
to have time to just ask people how

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,039
they're doing

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,600
you'll find out that your colleagues are

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,360
fun cool they have cool hobbies

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,679
you might find out that one of your

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,240
colleagues has made all of the furniture

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,520
in his house because he's also a master

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,440
carpenter

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,039
you won't know that if your meetings are

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,720
just what did you do yesterday what are

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,400
you planning on doing today

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,159
and do you have any barriers so

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
if you don't have the space to have that

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,279
that kind of fun

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,520
make some fun all right

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:43,039
and i actually like that

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,520
oh sorry there's an echo there i love

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,400
the point that smash raised in regards

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,840
to sparkle

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
i'm definitely going to use that word

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,640
from now on and

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,320
you know to kind of look forward to

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,279
catching up with your teammates like to

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,360
find out

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,799
you know how things are going what boxes

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
they're they're looking at at the moment

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,000
what book they're reading

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,279
and you know how their kids are how

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
their family are i think it's so

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,640
important

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,080
and to keep that connection going so i'm

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,000
definitely gonna gonna start

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,000
um asking people to add in a little bit

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
of sparkle into their daily stand-ups

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,880
all right and the next slide remote

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
participation

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,000
this is going to be short and sweet your

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,159
process

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
in a remote environment and really any

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,039
environment

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,559
is only as successful as the people who

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,400
choose to adopt it

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,480
so what's a tip here because right

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,120
you're going to work regardless

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,000
sit down have a team working agreement

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,080
or just something

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,640
that lists out here's how we're going to

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,480
meet here's how we're going to interact

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,400
don't make it an essay don't make it

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,520
pages people will not read that let

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,640
alone myself

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,320
make it easy document the workflow

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,760
meaning a few boxes and like pictures

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,200
that's great nothing extreme because

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,279
you really want these things to be

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,360
available for

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,120
let's say a 10 year old to be able to

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,840
consume and understand

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,799
it's supposed to be easy not difficult

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,880
and then

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,480
you're often asking for thumbs up for

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,400
agreement you know please act this

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,159
please let me know if this is good

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,440
but maybe change that conversation and

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,919
say

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,039
is anyone opposed to this because most

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,600
people don't care

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,559
right i'm not going to lie as an agile

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,159
practitioner

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,760
most people don't care how you want to

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,399
have stand-ups or how you want to do

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,120
this

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,159
they're actually just like just tell me

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,919
what to do

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
i'll do that so i can go back to what

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,799
i'm having fun with

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,880
so ask people does anyone have a thumbs

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,960
down on any part of this process do you

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,320
not want to have stand ups this way

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,559
and those thumbs down they will help you

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,159
facilitate conversations with the people

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,440
that didn't want to participate in the

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,279
process

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,559
there's nothing wrong with having a

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,399
thumbs down

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,320
the hard part is we never really asked

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,399
that question we just asked

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,360
did you agree to this and it's not

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,080
comfortable to say

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,600
i don't like this i mean eventually it

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,679
might become comfortable

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,520
after learning a lot of resilience and

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,039
having trust and safety

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,120
but especially in the beginning as your

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,600
team is trying to work together

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,120
ask for those thumbs down in a clear

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,960
visual way

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,039
don't make people speak in the meeting

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,559
because that's uncomfortable

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:28,080
pictures tools emoji downs

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,919
that will help you all right i think i'm

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
handing it over to you sarah to talk

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,520
about

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,640
some tips for scrum ceremonies brilliant

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,520
thanks for that hina

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,440
um and i actually only recently started

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,279
using the thumbs down if anyone on my

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,760
team is on here today

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,960
and because like that there's value you

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,799
know in the

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,720
in the things that people don't want to

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,000
agree with what are the items there what

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,720
are the reasons

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
why and to try and address those and so

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,120
thanks so much for sharing that tip with

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,840
me

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,200
okay so let's jump into um scrum

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,120
ceremonies

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,559
so these are really the cornerstone of

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,559
scrum um

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,360
and the the ceremonies that are in the

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,720
guide to allow a team to collaborate to

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,919
give feedback

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,399
and to work together to progress and so

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,320
on

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,520
and so really these are the the the

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,360
pieces and

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,120
that would uh that would kind of keep

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,480
a scrum team in in their cycle and

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,320
ensure that they're engaging with each

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,360
other

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,799
okay so let's look at um backlog

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,919
refinement

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,320
and the purpose of a meeting is always

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,919
and always really important to know when

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,720
you're going into something

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,240
what am i hoping to gain from it am i

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,960
what am i hoping to contribute

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,200
what will i what would be the outcome

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,760
when i leave this meeting will this help

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,799
me

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,240
um do my work work towards that goal as

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,120
a team so it's really important that you

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,120
know the purpose

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,039
and ensure that you're gaining value

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,159
through every meeting that you attend

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,840
not necessarily

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,760
just scrum meetings but every meeting

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,880
that you attend so the purpose of

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,200
backlog refinement

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,080
is to design define and understand

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,840
future work

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,799
that the team is prioritizing in the

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,399
next three to six months so if a feature

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,240
is coming down the line

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,080
over the next three to six months you

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,840
really want to scope out that feature

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,679
what are the important elements what are

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,240
the pieces that will deliver value

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,080
to our end users and ensure that that is

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,279
in your backlog you're continually

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,840
bringing the teaming

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,679
to review it to prioritize what are the

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,559
must-haves where the should has the nice

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,960
to haves

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,080
and to allow them for when the team are

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,080
ready to work on it

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,520
they have that information in place and

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
that will allow them to release the

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,720
value

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,640
sooner rather than later so common

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,039
issues with this

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
in a traditional setting co-located

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,919
environment

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,440
you have white boards uh traditional

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,520
white boards to work on

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,679
and to bring a team in to collaborate

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,520
together and to move stickies from one

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,000
place to another to really kind of

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,120
and engage and interact with each other

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,320
and also the

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,840
um the boards and most of the team

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,000
watches one or two people

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,080
filling out user stories as well so

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
sometimes backlog refinement become

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,720
become

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,480
um an activity that we see the product

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,240
owner maybe the tech lead

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,519
and maybe the scrum master kind of

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,080
filling out that

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,760
backlog so how can we address that how

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,679
can we get a little bit more connection

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,159
and engagement

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,159
so if we divide work of pre-filling

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,159
stories to the entire team

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,200
so they don't rely on product owners and

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,559
tech leads

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,760
so create um a a point

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,080
in your in your cycle in your sprint um

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,760
cycle to do backlog refinement and

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,559
invite the team in to

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,000
um add their own tickets and their own

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,880
tasks that they need to

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,399
uh work on to achieve uh that eat that

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,960
feature or that valuable

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,720
item that contributes to that feature so

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,799
share that ownership and share that

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
responsibility

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,080
tools are your friends and will help

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,120
with collaboration

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,240
so trying to and for teams to see the

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,720
bigger picture

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,039
um is quite challenging when it's online

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
so for them to see the overarching goal

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,120
and how their work feeds into that can

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,679
be

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,880
quite challenging so using a mirror

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,919
mural board

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,440
jira anything at all that will help with

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,679
that shared understanding

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,039
will definitely help the team uh pad out

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,760
that backlog

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,559
so more engagement more and explorative

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,600
questions

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,039
less blockers and going into sprint

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,600
planning and into your sprint

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,080
ends up and with delivering a better

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,080
solution

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,760
okay moving swiftly on to sprint

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,120
planning so i'm just conscious of time

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,279
here but we will share the deck

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,240
afterwards and myself and hina will join

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,559
the room to have

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,480
more of a discussion and so spring

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,080
planning so the purpose is to align and

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
agree to the work that the team will

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,120
complete

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,840
in the next bridge cycle and the common

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,159
issues

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,000
again we could see the the scroll master

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,720
the tech lead the product owner pulling

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,279
things

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,120
um into into the sprint so becomes just

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,640
um the team not engaging

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,480
not seeing the value of their

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,799
contribution so

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,240
how can you address you use your tool to

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,399
cue up the next fruit

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,840
and share with the team ahead of the

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,320
spring planning meeting

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,080
so that they can review it they can see

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,360
uh what needs to be done and if they

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,120
have any questions

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,279
that need further clarity at the

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,360
planning session so the planning session

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,480
becomes more of a valuable discussion

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,720
around the goals

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,240
gaining clarity and negotiating on

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,679
commitments

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,640
negotiating being the key word there

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,000
um the daily stand up again doesn't have

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,760
to be daily it just needs

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,679
to be what your comp your team are

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,360
comfortable with in regards to check in

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,960
what makes sense for the project and

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,919
where it's at as well

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,679
so common issues finding a time slot uh

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,519
to meet daily can be challenging

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,200
and people are not paying attention

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,840
until their name is called

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,640
so really stepping away and having those

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,720
silo

00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,679
pieces of work not feeling the overall

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,600
connection

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,120
and i think john really summarizes it

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
here on how we could

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,120
get a better engagement so having team

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,280
members tag each other

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,960
versus the scroll master call out people

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,800
so again you're waiting for your name

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,320
you don't know when that's going to come

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,520
and so you're going to be more engaged

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,240
you're going to listen more to the

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,159
overall

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,720
uh catch-up and progress report

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,919
so mix between async standups and i

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,919
create a chat channel if there's an

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,200
overflow of conversations that you can

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,200
have a have a chat with your team

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,679
okay and then the sprint review probably

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,679
one of the most important

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,079
let's take time to review all that great

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,079
work we've done celebrate as a team

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,520
and gain feedback from our users and our

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,000
stakeholders

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,560
so sometimes people aren't sure what is

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,200
worth

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,040
sharing so i've worked over the last two

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,639
weeks but i you might feel as a team

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,200
there's nothing that we can actually

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,800
show and and so you might shy away from

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,639
doing a sprint review

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,079
whereas what we've experienced myself

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,119
and enough channel about

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,400
um is there's always you know work to

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,720
showcase and and

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,760
maybe not to necessarily show uh in

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,400
tangible terms

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,280
but to just to share a story on to share

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,960
that journey

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,640
to share the the the trials and

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
tribulations of the value

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,640
that you have delivered by getting

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,119
through that and getting that off the

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,359
line

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,680
so maybe use an agenda ask team members

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,760
to volunteer ahead of time

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,960
uh to add topics there hello folks sorry

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,359
to interrupt you

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,040
but we are doubt of the time

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,400
unfortunately

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,400
uh so maybe last few comments and

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,560
we will move the discussion into the

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,040
discard okay

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,560
perfect thanks for that like uh so yeah

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,040
we were just going to go through

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,680
um our sprint retro you can have a look

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,760
at these and

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,599
myself and and here we'll chat can chat

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,560
afterwards and then we just

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,560
our last slide is just around um some

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,880
watch out so just to ensure that

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,560
you know we're we're not creating silos

00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,359
that we're actively reaching out to

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,400
connect

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,000
and in fun ways to to do that and so

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,920
thanks so much for your for your time

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,560
today we really appreciate it

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,320
and reach out at any point even after

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,760
after devconf and if you have any

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,599
questions or would like some

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,599
