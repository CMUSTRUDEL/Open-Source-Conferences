This session will go over how to make your scrum process friendly for a remote setting. Scrum thrives in settings where everyone is co-located but in the digital world we can not assume that teams working in the same office is the standard. How can Scrum work for your team when its now remote? Its simple! Tailoring the processes to meet your teams needs will allow you to continue working without reinventing the entire wheel. In this talk we will go over what our new remote norm looks like, what scrum is, steps to consider when tailoring, and tips on how to tailor some of the process based off of real world experiences working with remote scrum teams.
