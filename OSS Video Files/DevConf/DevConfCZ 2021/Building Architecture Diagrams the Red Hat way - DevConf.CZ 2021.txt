Title: Building Architecture Diagrams the Red Hat way - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-15
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: William Henry



How do you communicate complex, multi-product/project architectures clearly with your peers and customers? Which tool should you use? Is there a Red Hat recommended way? Good news! The Red Hat invested in some brand approved templates for the popular, and open source, tool called Draw.io. In this session you'll learn how to create multi-level architectures that include networking and data-flow elements. Come learn to use the same architecture language that others in Red Hat have come to love.

The workshop will include draw.io. This is javascript based and therefore doesn't need any special setup.
