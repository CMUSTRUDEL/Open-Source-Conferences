Title: Building Architecture Diagrams the Red Hat way - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-15
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: William Henry



How do you communicate complex, multi-product/project architectures clearly with your peers and customers? Which tool should you use? Is there a Red Hat recommended way? Good news! The Red Hat invested in some brand approved templates for the popular, and open source, tool called Draw.io. In this session you'll learn how to create multi-level architectures that include networking and data-flow elements. Come learn to use the same architecture language that others in Red Hat have come to love.

The workshop will include draw.io. This is javascript based and therefore doesn't need any special setup.

	00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,440
so

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,879
this building architecture diagrams the

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
red hat way

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,880
um i'm going to basically uh introduce

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,679
the sort of problem

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
um that we're facing at red hat around

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,920
this

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,800
and talk about the solution that we came

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,560
up with

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
um i think you'll be very excited i'm

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,119
hoping that many of you guys will

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,039
out there will start using the tooling

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,240
um so i'll go through a few slides as an

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,320
introduction

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,519
and then i'm going to launch into the

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,559
architecture tool

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,640
and provide you some um

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,800
sort of guidance and hints and thoughts

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
on it and then i'll point you to

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,399
some workshops and other things like

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,200
that as well

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,120
so first of all i grew up in ireland and

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,360
uh i actually wanted to be an architect

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,399
i think i was about 12 or 13 when i

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,760
first said

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,199
to my parents i wanted to be an

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,800
architect but it wasn't a software

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,520
engineering architect i wanted to

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,039
actually design

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,440
buildings um and so

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,480
uh unfortunately the way the irish sort

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,840
of system works

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,720
uh these centralized application system

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
and along with the

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,040
career guidance counselor they decided

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,040
to be better doing a better job at

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
computer applications at dublin city

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,759
university

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
so 30 years later or so here i am

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,280
at red hat and talking to you about

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
architectures so that's kind of weird

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,119
right

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
sorry the presentation do you want to

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,360
share

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,840
okay perfect okay yeah um

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
and so uh one of the buildings that

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,320
ireland doesn't have an awful lot of

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
cool

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,000
wonderful uh modern buildings or at

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,399
least didn't when i was growing up

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,119
this one was a cool one um it's the

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,720
central

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,880
bank uh in ireland and um

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,079
i'm gonna be looking at the chat here

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,200
i'm wondering does anybody

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,119
notice anything uh strange about this or

00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:02,079
any concepts about this building

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:05,520
no nobody's answering

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,520
i'm just looking okay

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,879
it's actually one of the only suspended

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,239
structures in ireland

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,200
and one of perhaps 20 in the world so as

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,720
you can see here

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
these this whole building is actually

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,239
suspended so it's built from the top

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,680
down two massive big metal girders or

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
whatever you want to call them are on

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520
here

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,520
and here and they go up to the top

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,560
and then the rest of the building is

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
hanging down

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
off of that structure across the top

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
pretty cool

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,800
right um but in you know almost a very

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,920
irish fashion uh the building was

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,680
discovered

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,599
to uh have reached a height of 150 feet

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,920
or 36 meters

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,080
which was exceeding what that was

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
approved by the dublin corporation at

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
the time

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,680
so there was a huge freeze and there was

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,519
a decision on whether to

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,440
raise the whole building which is tear

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
it all down and start a traditional

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,360
building from the top

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,319
from the bottom up because you can't

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
actually

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
take off the roof of a building that

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,239
you're building from the top down

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,159
right so uh it got it it got uh

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,680
an exception approval and was left to

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,480
stay there so what happened was

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,000
they had forgotten to add the top piece

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,159
here that's hidden under the copper and

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,400
everything like that that piece there

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,200
they've forgotten to actually put that

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
and and

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,480
account that into their to their

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,080
drawings so

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
just shows you the importance of doing

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,360
good architectural drawings and stuff

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,519
right um so we're going to look at some

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
bad architecture designs now of course

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,599
some people say that

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,519
that some designs are not so bad like

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,680
this one down at the bottom

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,720
to me it kind of looks like a cartoon

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
building right

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,519
it looks like maybe one extra person

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,920
passing gas might just explode the whole

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,040
thing

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,080
right but anyway um we're going to look

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,720
at some example

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,840
architectures at red hat you know we we

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
talk a lot about

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,080
you've heard the term reference

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,319
architectures at red hat

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
well when you scour the sort of red hat

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,959
um

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
architecture uh reference architectures

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,920
and you look for their architecture

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,959
diagrams you'll find a few different

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,840
things

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,759
so here's a um by the way i tried to

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,160
look for the earlier versions of these

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,040
uh open shift i don't know was it three

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,960
seven or three

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,080
five i can't remember but um they were

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,320
they were way worse than this so this is

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,919
actually kind of nice and clean

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,400
it breaks out the uh diet the networking

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,240
differently here right it also look

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,560
they've they've put in some cardinality

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,960
bits here which is nice and

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
they've uh showing some storage and that

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
sort of thing so

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,600
you know not bad nice and clean and

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
simple

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
and here we see oh they've introduced

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
some port numbers here

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
well that's nice too but that's not what

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
we were doing in the other one

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
you would think in the same product we

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,000
might have a little bit of consistency

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
here also

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,120
now the master node is is uh is sort of

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,800
broken out at the three um instead of

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
showing the cardinality of three so does

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,280
this mean there's only three application

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,039
nodes or does it just mean that there's

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,720
a minimum of three up oh and we've

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,320
decided to change the way we're showing

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,520
storage as well

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,680
so again nice clean uh diagram

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280
but a little bit inconsistent and here

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,080
it is for google and again

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,280
a little bit more like the first one uh

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
which is nice

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,840
um but we're missing some of that other

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
information that was shown on the last

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,360
one

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,960
whoa openstack wow

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,560
um that kind of got your attention

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,400
um this one looks more like a integrated

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
circuit board or something right it's

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,680
it's

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
uh it's not very attractive i'm sure if

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,720
the engineer who drew it

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
and some of the people worked on it got

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,919
it and understood it but

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,600
um it's not a very appealing

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,400
sort of diagram to look at and looks

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
like it's very complicated doesn't

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
it's a little bit different than the

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
other ones we just saw right so that's

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,880
the open stack documentation that we

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,319
have

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,000
um and then there's this one this is red

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,479
hat jboss eap 7 cluster this is the

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,919
reference architecture diagram at the

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,919
top level

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,160
um very nice a little bit color good

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,199
i'm not sure what these abcds are but

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,880
you know that's a

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:40,960
it's a pretty cool um diagram

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:45,120
it's got a lot of information sort of

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,199
let's see what the next one okay

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,919
nice and simple and clean but there's

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
not an awful lot of information here

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,360
right and again

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
not a very consistent with what we've

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,560
been showing on some of the uh

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,720
other diagrams at all this is more uml

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,199
style it's not giving us any sort of

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,599
cardinality or

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,960
what sort of connections these are the

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,759
network or what are they

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,240
right there's no real deployment details

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
here

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,520
um just sort of high-level logical

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,039
concepts

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,400
um and so then anybody see the problem

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,759
with this uh reference architecture

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,319
diagram for the business process

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,319
management

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,160
anyone

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,880
yeah there's none right so yeah you go

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,599
to that document and there's actually no

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,800
reference architecture there at all

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,039
correct hassan

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,759
thank you very much for paying attention

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,599
so yeah so we can see that there's a

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
huge amount of variety

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,440
in terms of what we're trying to do with

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,360
architectures and people

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,520
kind of tend to use their own tools and

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,000
that's fair right people are used to the

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,039
tools

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
that they have then there's no certainly

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,680
no mandate particularly in an

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
open source company like red hat to tell

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,080
anybody to

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,639
use a particular um diagram

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,360
tooling right so what we want to do is

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
we're trying to

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,400
search for a red architecture drawing

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,120
tool um

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,160
to make your architecture diagrams

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
informative

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
nice and clear and appealing appealing

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
to study

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,199
and appealing to um

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,360
appealing to architects who want to um

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,399
actually deploy things and and use the

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,240
diagram

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,120
as a way of deploying it right so

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,200
uh with that in mind uh one of the

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,399
reasons we strove for this was

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,120
primarily from a field you know whether

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
you're a

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,279
solution architect out there selling red

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,399
hat products or you're

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,760
a consultant out there delivering we

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,200
wanted something for the

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,399
for the field to be able to um

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,880
use as a way of

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,839
documenting what they're doing out there

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,000
but also providing that back

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,000
into a larger community that can reuse

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,080
those architecture so it was very field

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,480
focused about customer success stories

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,880
and stuff like that

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,399
so uh we wanted something that would

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,200
have a common process a

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
common visual language and basically a

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
tool set

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
so we could have a consistent experience

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
when designing and drafting

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,040
the idea here though is that it's not

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,839
just for

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,680
sales or fields right we would love for

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
engineers to be using this too as a

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,320
common language and that's why

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,560
uh we're here today talking about it so

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,760
the idea is to have happy architects

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,440
with drawings that are both attractive

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,080
we want people to want to look at them

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,880
and study them clean uh

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,519
enough detail though we want them to be

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,200
not just

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,760
a high level uh fluff but um

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,800
with high level concepts but something

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
that someone could go

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,480
oh okay i understand this i could even

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,360
get down to some firewall

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,839
rules as well if i needed to right so

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,120
readability consistent as well

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:17,839
and of course intuitive so

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,079
we picked diagrams.net

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,519
which is also known to many of you as

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,640
draw io

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,399
why did we do that well because uh it

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,440
was open source we actually

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,480
were working there was a few of us uh me

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,519
and marty wesley and eric chabel

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,279
and issue we were all

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,839
working on portfolio architectures

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,920
and we wanted to use a tool to do it and

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
we looked at it we looked at lucidcharts

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,959
before you ask

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,560
um and we picked draw that i o because

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,040
it's open source

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,360
uh which also means it's very extensible

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,800
so you can have extensible templates and

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,519
icons and stuff it's intuitive and

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,920
usable uh red hat brand approved so

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
red hat branding were part of it and

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,600
they helped us

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
build out the red hat templates so we

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,480
have

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,880
our own templates and icons it can be

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,240
hosted or we can use diagram.net with

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
loan parameters that's what we're doing

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
today that is

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
both of advantages or disadvantages and

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
it's also popular with other brands and

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,720
i'll show you that

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:28,000
in a while too where um inside the tool

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,440
you can select ibm's templates

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,680
or kubernetes templates or aws or google

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,800
or cisco or some others right

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,240
so uh with that in mind

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,640
let's see how we're doing on time we're

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,839
doing good um do we have any questions

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,839
so far

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,040
i will take that as a no

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,800
no questions so far that's fair okay

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
so i'm going to get into the tool in a

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,560
moment but let me describe what we're

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,320
going to be trying to do on the tool

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,839
we're going to have three different

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
views um

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
one is a logical view and if any of you

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
have gone through

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,120
some architectural training like for

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,920
example ibm's architecture training

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
everything

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
you'll see that this falls in line with

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,320
what they call things like

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,079
logical or physical architectures we

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
kind of talk about the high-level

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,000
logical architecture

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
a schema which is more detailed and

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,399
shows a lot of flows and

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
networking and then we have what we call

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
the um

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,760
node or service detail where we can

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,680
drill down on a specific piece

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,040
and have a look at that and say you know

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
what sort of ports

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,200
are open on the different networking

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
what processes are running on it if it's

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,880
a node

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,839
um you know again more information on

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,519
the cardinality

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,600
and stuff like that and we can also have

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,880
the flows in and out so we will

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,200
we'll talk about those uh in a moment

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,200
here's a an example of one from a from

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
an architecture diagram we had this

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,800
for what we would call continuous

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,600
remediation and you can see this is very

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,200
architecture this is not our tool so you

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,680
know this is the sort of thing that

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,279
at a 201 level people would use to do a

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,959
sales and just put it together and say

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,160
hey here we have smart management and

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,399
automation and

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,000
here's your red hat platform and your

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,160
this is your customer environment and

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,839
here we have red hat insights and it's

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,079
doing vulnerability and compliance and

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,600
system comparison testing over

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,360
and there's some sort of secure

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,560
connection here well when the customer

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,399
turns around and says hey

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,079
you know what yeah great but what does

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,040
this look like in my environment we can

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,480
say well

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,240
let's look at the logical diagram

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,760
logical architectures usually break

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,720
things out into

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,279
sort of locations now they could be um

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,600
geographic locations or within the same

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,560
location it might be you know oh here's

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,480
some

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,480
um this is the uh the

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
internals or the sort of interface

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,560
networking part of the core data center

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,040
when in the core data center maybe

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,120
there's um an open stack cluster and

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
there's also some bare metal machines

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,760
that are up there so you might want to

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,399
split it out that way as well right to

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,040
show

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,720
what's running on openstack or what's

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,360
running on

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,800
bare metal so so in this case what we're

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,959
just showing is a data set

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,760
running smart management automation

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,040
orchestration uh infrastructure nodes

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,240
and what we call hybrid cloud

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
infrastructure which is all about the

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,279
open shift hosts which might be core os

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,720
right

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,959
and then on the um on the red hat hosted

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,639
side on cloud.redhat.net we have these

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,399
insight services and the insights

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,560
platform

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,079
and here we're showing uh now the

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,320
physical or the schema

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,880
diagram and this one we're only showing

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,959
the networking at the moment right so

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,800
we're showing that there's a separation

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,399
between the network

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,440
uh that's internal at the at the data

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,639
center

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,399
uh there's obviously a a network up here

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
at red hat hosted

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,519
we don't really care too much about that

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,639
that's not really important to us to

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,120
consumer

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
um but there's also a internet

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,560
connection some sort of secure internet

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,120
connection between

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,920
um this smart management node that's

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,720
here

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,240
and the uh insights platform that's

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,880
that's running

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,279
that allows you to connect to

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,279
cloudthatredhat.com

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,800
and of course here this network is going

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,519
to be able to

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,639
get information between all these

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,000
various nodes

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,959
here right um here's the

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,560
uh you can add data flows then that

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,800
shows this and sometimes you might want

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,040
to split out like i've done here

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,399
on the network uh and actually remove

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
the networking from here

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,720
and i'll show you some tricks and tips

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,639
in a moment when we get into the tool

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
but this just shows some data flows like

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,839
hey we have a playbook

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,519
uh sorry we have anonymized data going

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,199
up from here

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,639
that was collected from the hosts

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,040
and we have uh remediation

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,000
plans coming back with playbooks coming

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,160
back that

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,240
playbooks get loaded into ansible which

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,040
will deploy those playbooks out to the

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,360
different hosts

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,800
keep them up to date and do whatever

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,880
remediation you have

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,240
the other aspect of this is that you

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,880
want to

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,519
be able to do dive into some of these

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
nodes and

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,120
show a look there's a secure http

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,839
connection

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,639
up to cloud.redhot.com on that purple

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,680
network and this administration

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,639
uh network is is is different

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,560
to that one you might want to put um you

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,360
might want to have like for example if

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,440
there's

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,120
smart management is using different

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,959
protocols here you might want to put

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,440
those protocol names

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,600
you know multiple blues here to say you

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,079
know ssh or

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,920
https or whatever else it might be

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,440
and you can load them down here we're

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,800
showing that there's three processes

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,519
running on this node

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,720
ansible runner uh cloud connector and

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,560
satellite

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,320
um and here is information coming in

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,800
from the hosts

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,920
anonymized data going out remediation

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,959
playbooks coming in

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,720
there's only one of these running so we

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,919
provide some information around

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,480
uh the different nodes okay

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,280
so looking at the time so now we're

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,839
going to launch

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,000
into the tool okay can you still see my

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,439
screen

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
and you'll be able to do this yourself

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,319
in fact what i'm going to do

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,880
is i'm going to put this in the chat

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:32,320
yes perfect and if you want to follow

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:36,640
along with me you can how about that

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,160
scary okay so we're going to launch this

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,600
and you'll see you're brought in here

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,280
and the only templates you're showing is

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,640
like a basic diagram one

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,679
are a red hat template and

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,440
what we're going to do here is we're

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,840
going to just say you know this is the

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,280
dev

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,280
conf example

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,360
um.draw.io file and i'm going to pick

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
all diagrams

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,880
right because uh i could pick each one

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,360
of these separately but i'm just going

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,160
to do i want all the diagram templates i

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,720
want it all

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,720
okay everyone following me so far

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
okay i'm going to press create here and

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,280
now we get brought in here

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,960
so i want to show you i'm not going to

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,200
do a full lesson today but i am going to

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,520
do a few different pieces to try to help

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,440
explain things first of all notice

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,440
we have along here this

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
all of the icon libraries these are all

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,440
red hat

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,360
brew approved brand approved so you'll

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
recognize these icons from our

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,440
icon templates are from our template

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,360
libraries of symbols and all that good

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,080
stuff that you're familiar with

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,960
we see the detail diagram pieces here

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
right we'll

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,200
go into that in a moment here's some of

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,120
the logical diagram pieces

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
um and then we have these schematic

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,919
pieces and i'll explain

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,160
some of these are services services with

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,120
with storage attached uh

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,559
nodes which could be physical or virtual

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,600
you can explain that in your

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,640
in your diagram are a node with

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
storage attached or not and then we also

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
have

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,400
um various pieces here where you can

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,120
zone things or maybe you want to label

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,960
something as

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,160
uh open shift um an open shift cluster

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,840
within a particular

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,280
area we'll see that in a moment within a

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,400
particular platform

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,400
and then we have these different

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,400
networking pieces

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,160
and i'll explain these labels again in a

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,640
moment and then

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,440
all these cool things right so schematic

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
logical

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
detail and all the icons now here's

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,880
where you can see these more

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,360
shapes and you'll see that there's a

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,960
whole bunch of stuff the uml is in there

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,440
we've got the aws cisco

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,039
ibm if you click ibm you get a whole

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,679
hostess i'll click on both of these just

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,760
to see

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,320
show them you can see down here you have

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,600
ibm analytics um

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,039
and here's the kubernetes ones so

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,880
we're not the only ones using this but

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:04,080
i'm gonna turn those off right now

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,799
because we don't need them okay

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,280
everybody with me so far has anybody

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,120
actually uh opened up the tool

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,480
just say yes yeah cool

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,159
okay the other thing you'll notice along

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,760
the bottom because i picked

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,440
that we're doing everything we've done

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,880
two things we have these things called a

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,840
kit of parts

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,360
which explain to you what each of these

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,159
little pieces are

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,320
right uh what the network nodes are the

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
technology details that you're using in

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,600
here the data

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,280
flows where you can and it says data

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,159
ports you could you could do it that way

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,400
too you could

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
add the data ports i like to add the

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,000
ports over here

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,679
uh you could add them here too to let it

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,320
know which port that's

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,360
flowing over so it was an mqtt port or

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,559
if it was

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,799
coming in over um you know although it'd

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,320
be pretty obvious if you had a

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
maria db or um something here and you

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,080
were

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
you were saying it was um whatever port

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,159
that is

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,120
i think it's 53 54

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,919
32. we'll talk about that in a moment

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,159
anyway

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,559
all that cool stuff there we have the

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
logical kit of parts here it shows you

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,440
all those pieces

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,200
so this is just kind of like a help it's

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,600
like a um

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,600
it's like here's all the pieces and and

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,000
it explains them all and tells you how

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,159
they

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,559
how they work or what you should try to

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,840
be using them for but it also gives you

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,880
some starting points so we're going to

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,159
look at the logical starting point right

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,919
i'm just going to turn around here and

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,600
let's just uh blow away these ones

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,679
i'm not really interested in them i'm

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,880
just going to use so there it gives you

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,440
a sort of starter place

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,799
you don't have to use this it's useful i

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,520
don't have a control plane

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,440
but if you want to you can just press

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,919
plus and start on a blank sheet if you

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,159
wish

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
right so what we're going to do is let's

00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,320
say we have

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:03,440
our basically our client device

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,480
is out here and running on

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,880
it we have uh an application so i'm

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,799
gonna

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,240
drop this app here let's just get rid of

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,760
this

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,000
now one of the things you'll notice this

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,039
is a tip you'll turn around and go

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,480
oh actually i can you oh excuse me oh

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,000
because it's already got color

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,960
i'll explain in a moment what i was

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,039
asking there for so here's a

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,480
this has changed so this is cool so

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,559
we'll just say that this is an

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,159
application it's not a containerized

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,320
application not a microservice

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,919
it's just an application so i'm just

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
going to drop this here now

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,960
when you're dropping make sure you're

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
dropping it on

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,679
when it pops up like that and usually

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,360
it's when you hit the middle of the

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,120
piece and so now it'll drop in there and

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,919
it's locked okay

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,080
and we're going to call this the web

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,360
application

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,760
and that's all we're going to call that

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,799
one

00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,159
and then we're over here we'll drop in

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,720
um another web application piece oh

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,320
and we can we can actually drop it in

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,320
like this

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,080
where we where we have uh some extra

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,440
text if we want as well like

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,960
um this is the uh

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,240
um shop ordering

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,240
system okay for your online shop and so

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,600
this is my online store

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,880
okay and it's a it's let's say it's

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,880
a um

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,960
let's say it's a microservice okay for

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,000
the moment we're just gonna

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,440
bump that in there okay and maybe we

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,840
also need to have

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,440
a web server so i pop that in here too

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,880
um and web server is

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,720
somewhere up here i think

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,200
where did i what icon was i use them for

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,600
that this one application server

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
so just call it my web server

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,170
okay i'm not providing any detail there

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,360
for that one

00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,000
[Music]

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,159
and let's say i also need to have and i

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,520
probably need more than one

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:17,039
but let's say i have a database

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,400
so i'm going to i'm going to make this

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,520
one

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,200
i have some text in it too so this is uh

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,520
let's see actually i won't i'm just

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,320
saying

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,440
product we might actually have multiples

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,279
of these so you're going to need a

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,120
product database

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,559
now what are the different colors the

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
different colors have to do with

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,640
look this is the kind of stuff i'm going

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,640
to be writing myself right

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,120
these are applications this is the the

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,440
the consumer is going to be

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,320
or the developer is going to be writing

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,760
this stuff

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,799
um himself or herself

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,200
uh whereas this is a piece of uh

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,000
app services this could be deployed by

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
the

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,200
developer or it could be deployed by as

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,760
some it could be deployed by the

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,240
developer as part of their application

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,039
but it comes from a library of approved

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,880
um

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,799
i.t stuff but these tend to be

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,039
the services sort of type of ones the

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,880
service icons tend to be provided

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,640
already by it they're already managed

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,360
long-term things things like

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,240
container registries or source code

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,240
management

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,799
or firewalls or databases for

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,640
in this example so we have those we can

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,640
also put things down as if we want to

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,760
just talk about particular nodes or

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
infrastructure because we're doing a

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,840
kind of higher level piece

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,360
we have uh we have infrastructure type

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,440
icons as well

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,880
these are the application services many

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,240
of you familiar with this is sort of

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,919
middleware type of stuff

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,360
right and then these are the things

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,799
we're building ourselves

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,400
okay so that's just a quick example of

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,960
how you might want to do this and this

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,679
might be

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,679
our data center in the cloud or whatever

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,679
right

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,640
so so far we've we've done the sort of

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,880
logical diagram and i've gone through

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,720
describing how to drop the icons in and

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,039
what the different colors are

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,159
and uh again we would just sort of

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,039
delete this stuff

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:17,120
here um and we can probably just do that

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,480
and get rid of that bottom part so now

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,559
we have a sort of

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,760
a nice little dagger normally here

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,480
though you probably make these

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,600
consistent

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,200
and have just sort of um uh uh

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,880
one with just the names on it and maybe

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,960
another one that has uh

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,159
if you wanted to drop into the details

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
just do the

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,679
sort of simple descriptions here um

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,200
for each of the icons in this device

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,039
right so

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,360
now that we've got that let's go into a

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,400
schematic and again you can see

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,159
um schematic has

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,480
a detailed diagram

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,000
sort of template already we're just

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
going to get rid of these guys and these

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,200
guys feel free to sort of drop things in

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,760
and out

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,799
i'm going to get rid of this then i'm

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,279
going to turn around

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,480
and let me have a look at how i've done

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,520
this already

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,159
oh yeah so um

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,559
this is a web application so i'm gonna

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
go

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,520
to my schematic uh there's no storage

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,640
attached

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,399
just gonna drop it here get rid of this

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,200
um now this is uh it's working that's

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,840
well wow

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
it's great okay so i'm able to move that

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,880
around now

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,799
you start not be able to do that you

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,600
have to double you had to click off and

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,440
click on

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,960
it's now working this is great marty

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,799
well done so now this is an application

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,000
um i'm going to drop that here i'm going

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
to call it my web app

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,159
and i'm going to change the color of

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,480
this to green

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,679
um cardinality on this is going to be

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,559
just one

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,520
right technology i'm using here is you

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,799
know

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,799
html and

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,880
javascript right

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,559
um so it's probably a javascript piece

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,960
with html embedded in it okay and then

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,679
i'm going to have to talk right to a

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,200
uh application server so the question

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,960
then becomes when you come down here

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,720
is is my application server a node

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,840
or is it deployed inside of

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,320
something like openshift and it might be

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,399
containerized

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,159
so let's go with the containerized so

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,960
let's first of all

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,760
drop this here and say we're going to

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,200
have

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,159
let's delete these we can fix that up

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
later

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:49,200
and we're going to actually have a

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,200
in my data center

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,240
i'm going to have a

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,240
open shift

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,159
container platform okay

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,960
so that's cool now i can turn around and

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,760
say well

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,760
uh i'm gonna drop in this guy

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,840
um we're gonna get my application server

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,880
piece here

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:21,600
drop it in change that to web server

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,760
uh the it's probably gonna be i'm gonna

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,559
tell an open shift to keep it up and

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,760
going so maybe the cardinality is three

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,840
um and i'll say maybe it's nginx

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,200
right and i change the color here to

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,919
blue

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:40,799
okay so that's cool we got we got the uh

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,159
we got the web server running now i want

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,240
to add a network

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,520
between this and the web server okay

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,679
so um i go down here there's two ways of

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,320
doing this i can click on this

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,200
and manipulate it or i can use these

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,720
arrows

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,320
okay i'm going to click here um

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
and actually i'm not going to pick blue

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,799
i usually pick purple for

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,440
internet that's just my preference drop

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,679
it here

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,360
it'll click i'll drop that one there

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,360
and i'll just do it this way so we can

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,760
keep it nice and clean

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,640
um and i can tell it that that's uh

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,200
internet connection

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:27,039
um maybe it's uh maybe i say https

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,240
right there so that's good now i have

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,279
cardinality

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,520
i have my web application connected

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,120
i'm just going to add one more just to

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,120
show that

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,399
now we're going to have our application

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,240
name in fact

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,080
what we might want to do here is split

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
out that application into multiple

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,000
microservices right so

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:53,760
this is a containerized microservice

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,760
maybe this is the single sign-on service

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,679
so i know normally you would match

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,120
exactly with your

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,720
with your uh with your logical diagram

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,640
but uh in our case it might be

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,880
ridiculous to put all of the different

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,720
micro services listed

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,519
for an application you could on the

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,720
logical diagram i could go back here to

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,559
the logical

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,120
and fix this up and just add all the

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,559
different microservices

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,720
but what i'm going to do is i'm just

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,720
going to break them up here now

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,080
i need another network because that's

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
not going to be the same network that

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,720
this is on

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,120
so i'll pick this one and i'll connect

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,960
that

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:40,559
to here and to

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,559
here okay so let's just break this out

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,720
notice that

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,000
once you get this going it's uh and then

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,960
we can just call this the internal

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,960
application network

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,799
internal app network how are we doing on

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,919
time there by the way

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:05,039
good i think we're good

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,000
um so the other question is is if we had

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,960
data flowing

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
in so we might have uh let's say data

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,960
here

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,679
we can go i like to go as much as

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,880
possible from the left hand side

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,559
to the bottom sort of as an in in and

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,640
out but in this case it might not make

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,480
sense to do it that way i'll just go

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,399
from here to here

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
and say now again you can break these

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,440
things out right

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,080
and say that

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,080
that their

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,640
that their would do the data flows on a

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,000
different diagram

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,200
if you do that it can be helpful to

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,039
um pop in and say what network

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,799
it's on so you can say that you're doing

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,399
a message

00:32:52,799 --> 00:33:00,720
at this service and then you can

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,679
delete this information here

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,679
if i can get at it

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,159
you can delete that one if you can

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,120
select it let's see if i can select the

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,240
thing

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,760
why is that working here i will be able

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,440
to select it and delete it and you can

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,600
add the label here and say

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:24,559
this is the user id and password

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,399
um okay for that piece right and it's

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,519
going across the blue network

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,399
do you see that so that's what those

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,399
labels are for

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,640
is to describe what data and you can see

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,240
how useful that is if you break it out

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,399
within diagrams um you can see that

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,640
the uh a few of the networks on one

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,480
diagram and the data flows on the other

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,320
having the blue label to go with the

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
blue color can help explain

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,320
ah that data flow is going across the

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,279
blue network as opposed to

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,840
um if there was another network in here

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,880
as well

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,919
how are we doing time wise five minutes

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,279
left okay good so the other thing uh you

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,200
might want to know about here

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:08,320
is this let me just show you if i do a

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,000
flow here uh

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,560
like this and i i do this and then i do

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,839
that

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,320
and then i do this and um

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,000
i'm then getting it all wrong and i'm

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,520
trying to figure out how do i get

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
this all i can just turn around and

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,679
like if it gets really convoluted and

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,720
you're trying to fix it up and you're

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,960
going wonder

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,399
so you can turn around here and click on

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,440
the right hand side of this

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,599
and just say it um clear the waypoints

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,480
and you're back to normal again so you

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,800
can turn around

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,399
and fix up those diagrams that you are

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,440
trying to

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,240
get things now also if you have a a link

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,520
like that where it's overflowing you can

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,960
turn around down here

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,359
on this side and say i want to either

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,639
have an

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,400
arc or a gap and so you can have nice

00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,040
little gaps between your diagrams as

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,880
well

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,720
the last one i want to show you is the

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,320
detail diagram

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,520
where you can pop in something like

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,240
this for your database

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,599
so you can put the database piece in

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,400
here let's

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,200
that's not a database one this one's the

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,200
database one

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,960
so we drop in the database

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,560
and we move that up here and this is

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,599
where you can drop in these nodes and

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,720
say okay

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,520
over this network i want to be doing um

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,839
this is

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:45,040
port uh what did i say was 54

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,560
5432 right for

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,920
postgres or is that postgres yeah

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,760
postgres is 54

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,200
postgres q154 right so that's the

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,119
of course you already know that up here

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,720
so it's a product database or something

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,400
like that and you

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
can change these and then for here i

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
usually say hey if it's input i just put

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,280
a greater than sign and it's the

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,880
um actually in this case it's a

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,359
read product details

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,040
okay so that's what this is for and

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,480
again you can just delete the pieces

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
well it's not that

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,599
you can delete the pieces that you don't

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,599
want to use

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,640
keep on doing that right same over here

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,320
okay so that's the tool uh one of any

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,560
other tips on that one

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,760
is the starting cameras oh yeah please

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,040
in your schema

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,079
do not use like

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,160
if you've got a data flow piece um

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
and you're using a microservice more and

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,240
more times

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,520
unless that's a separate microservice

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,839
don't turn around and do

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,000
these are deployment diagrams they're

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,119
not about

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,960
workflows they show data flows

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,560
but they don't say hey this and then the

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,000
data comes back to here and then it goes

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,079
out of there and then it comes back

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,680
don't put something in multiple times

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,800
put it in only

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,200
once okay so back to my presentation

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,920
cause right now i'm going to show you

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,280
that

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,960
the all we have left to say for this

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,320
is that there's going to be links here i

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,520
sent the pdf

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:23,280
uh earlier i can upload that again but

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,280
there's examples out on red hat dot

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,720
demo central i can show you that as well

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,960
during the q a

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,040
um there's the tool itself which i

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,960
showed you a link for already earlier

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,160
and then there's a whole workshop on how

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,680
to use the tool

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,800
um as well out there too awesome william

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,520
we have one question in the pool

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,720
uh it is it is possible to download the

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,839
saves and use

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,839
in on uh diagrams what is the list and

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,839
the license for them

00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,480
yeah uh there's no license

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,359
so um i want to understand this a little

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,680
bit more uh

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,720
you can what i usually do and that's a

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,839
great question

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,599
is am i still sharing we usually do this

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,760
file export as a png

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,359
when you try to do export you should go

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,040
to 300

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,480
uh you can say it's transparent or not

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,480
i'm going to do the whole size of the

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,480
diagram

00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,520
export and

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,200
i'm going to save it to my device and

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,440
then when you look at that here

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,680
when it opens you can see you can pull

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,400
these into your google docs then right

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,280
you can just

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,160
um use those in your google docs it also

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,560
integrates

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,240
with uh we're still trying to do some

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,240
work right now we're actually

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,960
not hosting this ourselves we're

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,520
literally using the

00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,040
diagrams.net app we're just passing it

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,560
some information to say i want you to

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,599
turn off all the other templates

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,359
by default and use our template as a

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,320
sort of default templates along with the

00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,240
basic

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,119
um so yeah there's no uh you can you can

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,359
use these

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,880
uh they're red hat branded but by all

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,320
means go ahead and use them just like

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,119
you could probably

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,839
uh go out and use the other ones so from

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,839
other

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,839
