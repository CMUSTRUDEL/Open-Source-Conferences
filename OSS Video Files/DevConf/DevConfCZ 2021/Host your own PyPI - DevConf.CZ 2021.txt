Title: Host your own PyPI - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-15
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speakers: Pavel Picka, Daniel Alley

In this workshop you will learn how to install Pulp3 and use it for sync packages from PyPI, manage packages (add your own package), and distribute your own repository.

We use a pulp-installer with a pre-built container (https://github.com/pulp/pulp_installer).

You will learn how to:
- install Pulp3
- sync PyPI (only packages by your choice)
- add your own package to your synced repo
- distribute your repo
- install package from your mirror

Requirements:
- libvirt/virtualbox
- vagrant
- git

* building your own python package is not included.

	00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,319
my name is paolo pizka

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
and here my colleague danielle we both

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,400
work for pulp

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,200
so you can go for it

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,119
what i got what i try to introduce you

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,840
today it's

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,160
the basics about the pulp and because

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,640
this is the workshop i will show you

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,840
how to install the pulp how to sync some

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,599
packages from

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,160
pi pi i would show you like

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,040
mirroring whole pie pie although it's

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880
possible

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,399
but we don't have so so big discs and

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,160
connection then i will show you

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,600
just few uh workflows how you can

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,440
manage your packages your repositories

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,000
and so on so basic interaction to pulp

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,079
we are like software package management

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,960
system

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,239
uh today i will focus mainly for python

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,600
packages

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,400
but it's not only what what the pulp can

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,799
do

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,640
you can in the same way seeing the

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,479
debian rpm packages

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,960
ansible arrows even the container images

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
so in the end you can start with the

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,360
python packages

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,640
and if you want you can extend

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,240
this to any of these supported

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,240
content yeah what you can do with the

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,439
pulp it's like

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
syncing you can upload your just your

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
packages

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,200
managing these packages or just

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,640
mirror or distributing

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,640
uh more so and why pal

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,960
for example my favorite

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,960
example is the second one because

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
sometimes there is the networks without

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,680
internet connection and there is only

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,840
one proxy so you don't want to

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
like download all the packages again and

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
again so

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
pulp can be there like local storage for

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,320
your

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,879
packages and you can use native clients

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,599
for the contents you need

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,560
so that's coverage even the local

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,720
storage

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:20,080
and and then as i mentioned before

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,680
of pulp there there is possibility to

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,040
single application manage or

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,120
various types of content

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:35,120
so there is some prerequisite is

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,519
what we need and

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,959
that's just in the minute and there is

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,680
various ways how to

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
install palm i will show you one of the

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
easiest

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,319
but there is more you can install

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
directly from paripai

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,800
like from python packages or if you are

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,239
on rpm distro

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,560
you can install from rpm it's not

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,640
really maintained by us but if you know

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,200
the catalog project they maintain the

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,720
project

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,840
how to install pulp by rpm

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,440
then we got our pulp installer and

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,879
thing called the pulp lift which helps

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,560
you a lot pulp installer

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,080
is used for any

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,519
various installation types and pulplift

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,879
it's yet help you to set up the uh

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,599
virtual machines that like do

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,920
all the setup for you like pulp lifts

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,799
just

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,799
prepare the virtual machines and run the

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,319
pulp installer

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,440
and very lately we introduced the single

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,840
container

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
which you can try with docker but i

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
don't

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,120
will use this way but

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
if you want to know more you can go for

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,640
pulpproject.org

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,200
rg and it's pretty easy but

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,439
it will install like all plugins not

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,400
only the python like i want to show you

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,879
today

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
but it will install all those supported

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,480
plugins like that rpm ansible

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,599
and so on so that's why i choose the

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,239
pulp installer

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,280
way so there is some requirements as i

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
said

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,680
so we need vagrant

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,880
uh then libya or virtual books

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,440
i'm not on like rpm discord so i'm using

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
virtualbox so in that case you use the

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,759
same

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,040
uh you need exports this vagrant default

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,080
provider

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,000
do not specify it in command line

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
then you just need the ansible ansible

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,160
galaxy and git client

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:44,880
that's pretty it

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,240
i think that's pretty nice to introduce

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,160
direction so i can

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
show you how to install the power

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,479
here it's like few commands but i will

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,479
show you in the command line

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,240
okay i think it's visible

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe i can make it bigger if you want

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,840
any feedback on this

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,960
okay looks that's fine

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,520
so first just get clone our installer

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,720
it's pretty fast it's like a few

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
unsuitable playbooks

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,560
we use few submodules so when you

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,600
first time clone our fault installer

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
repository

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,240
you need like update and in its

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:53,840
few sub modules okay typo

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:56,880
so update

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,880
yeah that's pretty good

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,479
and now if you go to the vagrant i will

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,840
just show you the

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,120
uh we support many boxes uh today demo

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,080
will be i use the fedora 33 box

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
but i just show you there is like

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,800
various

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,800
possibilities what you can try bulb

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
you can see from debian fedora on santos

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
we use the sandbox one it's for the

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,280
users that

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,440
it's easier from the source

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,919
code but this is not the scope of today

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,919
workshop

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
okay

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
yeah and i forget there is example

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,840
config we will be using

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
the same box that's the user there is

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,800
another option that you don't

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,199
override this one but you create the

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,720
local.userconfig.yml

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,199
but i will use this one here

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
basic options are set so you just need

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,720
uncommentable

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,720
python

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,919
i will apply file here but you can

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:30,880
comment it out but

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:34,560
i would say this is fine

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,880
and now let's make our vagrant script to

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:45,840
prepare everything for you so as i said

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,840
we use the sandbox on fedora 33

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,879
okay it's pepper the guest for you

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,319
but if you will like later we will

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,720
want to try pulp on like

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,680
normal machine only or your own virtual

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
machine

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
it's fine that you won't use this

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
vagrant

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,039
but just the pulp installer which is

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,039
possible even to

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:26,160
install from galaxy ansible galaxy

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,479
so you don't have to even download

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,599
our git repository yeah and now

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,039
it's running the installer itself which

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
prepared database for you

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,360
here i will just mention uh um

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,600
as i said there is possibility to

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,760
install file from pi pi

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,920
but i would recommend really to use the

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
installer because it will set a lot

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,959
thing

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
a lot of things for you for example the

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,680
database the pulp services

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
which you will have to check or a little

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
edit manually

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,760
if you use just direct install from

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
wi-fi

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,760
but the installer using these packages

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,399
so it will be the same

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,399
it's just save you a few steps for you

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,959
yeah here you can see like a lot of

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,839
skippings but that's fine because we

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,880
support a

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,000
lot of boxes as i showed you before

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
so there is like

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,160
some tasks

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,399
directly for some oss for example there

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,120
is some differences between the central

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,240
os and

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:51,839
fedora and much more than centos and

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:51,839
debian for example

00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,920
yeah it will take some time because

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,920
there is few things we need to learn

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
about

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,200
although also after the

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,959
this database it will prepare for you

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
the

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:24,160
http server so

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,040
if you will or want to install pulp on

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,839
your

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,920
server when you're already running some

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,640
web services

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,440
then it's good to use that manual way

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,480
from pipe i

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
for example when you set all your

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,760
proxies and settings

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,360
of your apache from ng mix or your own

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,360
i just mentioned here

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,760
defaults to our pulp installer we

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,800
installed the nginx

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,680
but there is option to

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,279
choose the apache these are to our

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,000
supported

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
web servers

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,760
also did this installer prepare for you

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,519
self-signed certificate but still there

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,519
is the option if you got your own

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
you will just specify in this file that

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,600
you are using

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,600
your certificate or more option

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,920
if you are like want to know more about

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,279
this installation i would

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,560
suggest you go for about installer

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,040
page documentation and there is it's not

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:43,839
big

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:43,839
and i think it's pretty nice described

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,079
sorry

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,079
yeah true if you got any question or any

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,720
help with the installation

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,200
if anyone follow us please write it in

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,200
the chat

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,240
we can answer you or help you there are

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,959
two of us here so

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,279
we can wait a bit and help you with the

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:39,839
installation

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,839
or anything you need to set up

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,560
here you can see that it's packages from

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
pie

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:07,839
pie just steps more

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:07,839
than helps you

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,040
yeah i think it will be near the end

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,839
that's a lot of

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,839
task was already done

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
yeah sometimes if you are trying with us

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,800
the trust or selling

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:39,680
context sometimes took some time

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:49,839
but we are installing like clear ones so

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:49,839
shouldn't shouldn't take so long for us

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,120
yeah few final steps

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,680
you see like installation took like five

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,279
minutes

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,720
more depends on the machine

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,839
for sure you can even edit little bit

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,600
uh here the vagrant setup for example at

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,480
the memory or

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,560
more cpus if you are familiar with the

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:38,079
grand

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,079
you can pretty much customize it

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
yeah i just can't say there's also a uh

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,600
a single container

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,160
um and uh a

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,639
container image that you can use to run

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,959
pulp

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,760
um that has several planes including i

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,880
think the python plug-in

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,760
yeah it's there but i wanted to show

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
just the python

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,279
today so for sure you can go for a

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
project there is nice page about it it's

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,920
like three steps so

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:27,839
like three steps less than this one

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:27,839
and you will have everything

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,800
yeah now we got the bulb installed

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:45,279
so it didn't look so take some

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,279
so well so it's fine

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,839
and we can run the box

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,639
or go to the server i just show you one

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,040
trick

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,000
because because we are the django

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,120
application

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,320
there is possibility to use like

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
that good grief a little bit i wouldn't

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
say it's really

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,480
agree for us but it's django basic

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,000
administration

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,720
which is pretty good so with this

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
comment

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
like when you are associating to our

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,360
sandbox machine

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,079
you can say uh

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
to format few parts that we can use a

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,399
browser

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
on our host machine

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,839
so let's connect

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,279
yeah uh now when we are uh install the

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,079
bulb

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,880
let's connect to it and i would just

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
suggest

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,319
few tools that we can

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,439
use and the first one is http

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,720
ie which is python

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,199
application for like http client but

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,079
it's very nice formatted and particular

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,160
for

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:22,319
so you can see like

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,959
much better the answers from the server

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,799
and then there is the dotnet rc for

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,799
autotune

00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,679
authentication because pulp of course

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,200
require

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:38,799
the login and password to operate on it

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,240
so we will it will pass this one so

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,240
let's install the http

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,960
and let's set up our net rc

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,960
we are on the locomotion server so

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,400
let's say it's localhost

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,520
and this is the basic

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,840
already prepared login and password

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,120
which i recommend for sure check after

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,039
you're testing it if you

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,919
decide to go on so admin and password

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,520
it's pretty

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:17,360
what you want this is the file do not

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,360
dot net rc in your home

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,760
and i think this is like pretty good

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,520
prepared

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,400
to show some work slows

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,039
uh just one more thing uh it's basic

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,520
setup

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,919
so i will just use the http client with

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,720
f

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,520
which is like to follow the links it

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
shouldn't happen

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,160
here but if you are using it over the

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,440
proxy or using for example the docker

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,840
installation

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,600
you need to follow or it will fail on

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,640
first direction

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,600
and because i didn't specify any known

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,640
certificates there is self-signed which

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,960
installer

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,320
doesn't automatically add to your system

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,559
so

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,760
you have to specify for your clients

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,799
that you don't want to

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,200
check the ssl and you want to form it

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,320
okay you can see the status of the pulp

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,799
that we installed

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,679
we got bulker is there all the time

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,760
power python

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:21,440
and the pulp file we just let it there

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,000
a few workers two workers

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,360
and one manager for that and online

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,960
content up

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,960
that i will show you it later

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:39,200
ah okay this is the so that was the

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,320
installation and just basic

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,080
api call to check

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:50,000
if the pulp is installed okay or not

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,000
so i think we can go for the

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,360
some workflows so in the first one i

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,720
will show you

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,240
how to sync from pi by but as i said i

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,799
won't sing the whole

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,000
bye bye because my machine definitely

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,480
don't have

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,360
such storage so i will

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,000
sync few packages so the steps we will

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,799
need

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,320
it will be for pulp to create repository

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,039
that will be that our

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,960
repository we will create the remote i

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,039
will stop little bit there because there

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,720
is a lot of options you can

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,120
use with that then we sync it

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,280
prepare the publication and then i will

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,559
show you how to distribute it

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,600
for more clients and just fast

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,760
check out on big clients how to set it

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,760
up

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,320
so here

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,039
will be this one

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,679
so let's continue with the sync

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,039
yeah and as i said before i would

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,559
prepare a few comments just alias that

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,840
i don't have to repeat all the time

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,640
and it's good too because uh

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,559
the basic setup for apache or nginx in

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,280
this case

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:24,400
it's the default port is 24 817

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,520
uh i think in default uh installation

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
it's even

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,280
there is setup proxy for the 80 and four

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,880
for free

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,320
but i would use the default one to you

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,200
can

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:41,919
see okay so as i said the first step

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,720
will be to create repository uh just

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,159
here i would

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,280
like to mention that i am using the

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,640
api which we had but lately we

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,080
heavily worked on the pulp cli

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
which will be like much more easier to

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,159
use

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,600
and you don't want to you need to

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
recall the api

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,880
so this is the base

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,840
base call for our as you can see

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,240
i am using the client i mentioned and

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,880
the areas i prepared

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,679
so almost everything in pulp starting

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,799
without

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,640
pulp api v3 so i

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:31,520
set about to create the python

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,520
repository for me and call it my pi by

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,720
here you see i got the response it's

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,120
pretty colorful that's why the client

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
for us we'll be in uh interesting the

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,760
pal breath

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,159
that's newly created repository which we

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,200
use

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,720
later on and

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,679
uh here i create a remote so

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,360
this will be the server where i want to

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,480
download

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:05,039
so in our case it's pi pi dot org

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,559
so this is the basic call for it i will

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,240
name it by pi but

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,880
here i would like to say that

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,760
if you use python and python vendor

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
snatch

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,799
it's possible to use the vendor snatch

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,840
config file

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,480
instead of the url and

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,960
it's just the different endpoint which

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,760
will be

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,440
like remotes python but it will be from

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,159
vendor snatch

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,960
and you will have to specify instead of

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,640
uri

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,520
the file the path to

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
config file of japanese snatch i won't

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,440
uh show it

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,159
to you today but definitely there is the

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,679
option

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,679
and mention it here

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,320
i'll just add to that real quick uh we

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,159
also support uh several of the options

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,640
the vander snatch config file

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,320
uh supports so like filtering out

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,000
pre-releases

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,880
and um uh putting version filters and

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
package filters

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,640
see you don't sync all of pi pi

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,279
just certain packages we support a lot

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,279
of those features

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,679
yeah and i because when you use it like

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,640
this

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,679
uh without just the name and url you

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,440
know pulp

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:30,720
will try definitely seeing whole pie pie

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,200
and that's not desirable option today so

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,840
there is the option even from url not

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
only for

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,720
vendor snatch that we can specify what

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,240
we want

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,279
to include so i choose just two packages

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,559
and it's pygame and jungle and with

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,679
django you can see

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,720
that i specify it will be just django

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,559
bigger than 3.0

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
and that's because there is a lot of

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,080
versions of django

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,120
and you will see because the pi game is

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,919
just the name

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,200
it will download all the accessible

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,200
versions of my game

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,840
what we got so

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,720
or there is yet other way that's not the

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
includes

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,559
but we can sync almost everything and

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,320
just put

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,000
excludes so we can think like everything

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,159
just few packages or the list of

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,200
packages we don't want

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,000
here i would say because we support the

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,600
policies

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,559
like download policies so you can choose

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,159
uh from the basic options if you want to

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,279
download all the packages

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,159
right away so when we are when we will

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,760
be syncing

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,360
it will download all the packages on

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,000
your local storage

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,720
then there is on-demand which it's

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,320
download

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,000
only the metadata and when the client

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,320
asks for the package

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,880
it will download the package from pipe i

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,799
and then it will serve to the client

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,799
i think there is the third one which is

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,520
stream

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,279
um and now i'm not pretty sure if the

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,720
python one really supported

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:14,000
now so these two as i described uh

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,480
are what we can choose so i

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,799
think i'm pretty sure there is the

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,799
default one for python is on demand

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,640
and the reason for that is because pie

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
pie

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,520
if you think all of pipe i is 6.8

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
terabytes

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,440
so we don't want to uh by default have

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,799
people

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,279
filling up their entire hard drive and

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,279
then some

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,720
yeah exactly i mentioned it we don't

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,880
want to

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,200
download all that but if you forget

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,320
about the includes includes and just

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,440
make basic sync at least it won't

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,159
start to download all that data what is

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,000
on pi pi

00:26:52,159 --> 00:27:00,559
and after that here statistic okay

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,600
you can see that there is the response

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:08,159
here you can see the policy definitely

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,159
here it's the remote address

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,360
so what we want to do now we got our

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,960
repository we got the remote

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,960
so we can sync it

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,559
so we choose the repository the endpoint

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,600
sync

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,640
and send it like which remote we want to

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,200
sync

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,200
inside

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,559
yeah paul is test task based system

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,440
so it will be done asynchronously that

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,440
you can still

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:47,360
work with pulp on order tasks

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,480
so i will show you here

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,960
just let's check the this task you can

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,960
see it's

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,600
completed there was over 200

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,039
associate content that's because there

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,399
is a lot of versions

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,520
of django even more than free and total

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,520
version to buy game

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:19,279
so now we got in the pulp

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,559
uh no sorry i just want

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,679
to see my

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,080
here it's okay so now

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,919
we need because it's already synced it's

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,960
on demand so we got all the metadata

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,960
here

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,000
so we can continue so

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:42,080
we call the publication endpoint

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,640
we set the which repository version

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,600
yeah i didn't mention this one because

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,279
when we create

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:53,440
the new repository it's starting

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,440
empty and pulp for

00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,559
uh how to say it for better user

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,840
friendliness uh we use the versioning of

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,640
the repositories so

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,360
the for our first thing it's the

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,520
repository version number one

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,399
and later i will show you when i will

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,799
change anything

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,159
in the repository that these basic

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,480
versions still will

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,000
last in the pulp and you can go back but

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,200
it's little later for the workflow

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,600
so here we choose

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,559
that repository version we are already

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,960
synced

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:33,840
you can see it in the creator resources

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,840
when you synced

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,880
in the task that this is the repository

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240
this is the version number one

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,039
that one we want to use with the

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,039
publication

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:55,840
so here again the task so let's check it

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,279
it's completed that's fine again you can

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,640
see there is creative resources and it's

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,880
publication

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,960
this is uh pretty prepared for the

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,159
distribution to your users

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,399
but it's not like open to users yet it's

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,760
like your preparation

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,159
so now we need to distribute it

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,360
so we call the distribution endpoint

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,240
python bye bye

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,960
because we always remembering we call it

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,559
name

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,760
base name and we set which publication

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,760
we want to distribute

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:39,440
so again the task

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,480
you can see it's done so

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,640
our distribution is ready now

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,600
when you create this distribution there

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,000
is

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,960
our content up which i mentioned before

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,760
which was visible there

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,399
and that serves the contents to the

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,600
users

00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,720
and outside file

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,679
here you can see as we said the

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,960
basic host name or our host name there

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,399
is the url

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,159
where the content is living so it's pulp

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,279
content my pie pie

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,159
if you are really near to server we use

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,080
little different

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,080
port it's 24 816.

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,240
and we will show it

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,880
very soon i will just show you

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,399
let's create goodbye by config for our

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,559
new server

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:41,360
so it's basic global and index url

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,360
and i will

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,960
specify our localhost

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,760
we report 24 816 content

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,200
and the name or the base path as i said

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,640
my pie pie

00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,080
and that simple stuff here just for

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,440
don't forget uh to add the trailing

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,399
backslash

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,799
sometimes it can cause issues sometimes

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,840
not

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:14,240
but it's better for pipeline to work

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:18,480
like this

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,480
i'll just check it it's fine

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,720
and we can try install for example buy a

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
game

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,000
and you can see there is like looking

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,559
for indexes

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,760
and it's already installed from our

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,760
local adversary

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,919
and i think that's pretty that's the

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,600
basic for the singing

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,799
uh and i see we are already

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,919
33 minutes gone so is there any

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,159
questions

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,159
yet

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:12,080
if there is no question i can show you

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,600
yet one uh easy workflow and it's how to

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,320
add your own package

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,919
to your repository and how to update

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,519
your distribution

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:25,840
so we will take what we already got here

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,840
and we will just add one package

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,720
okay first we need to download some

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,360
packages

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,279
i choose pulp python package from pie

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,440
pie

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,559
i think that's enough like the example

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,559
so let's download it

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,519
a better or my recommendation is

00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:02,240
to download it with the entire.gizet

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:05,600
but you can we support even the vhl

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,159
and more extensions but be aware we are

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,280
checking

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,520
what you are uploading to the pulp so

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,399
if you don't fit any extension which is

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,839
used with

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,839
packages we want

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,399
the pulp denied to upload it so there is

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,520
the basic workflow

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,359
uh i will show you the little harder one

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,320
like two steps but there is possibility

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,919
to do it

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,240
in one step but

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,760
that's never mind so i will update this

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,240
package i download it

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,560
it's like to just get the file to the

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,560
pulp

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,560
so yeah we got it the artifact we call

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,000
it artifact it comes

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:56,399
h check sums for it and

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,920
um save it inside the media route or

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,040
like our storage then we have to say pal

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,079
uh that's how to

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,119
work with this uh file

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,760
so we set its python package so

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,440
it's an order like it's already content

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,560
endpoint it's python and

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,400
python package we just specify the

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,800
relative path and file name

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,560
it's very you know to keep and you can

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,240
find it later

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:30,240
by these names and points that

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,680
uploaded artifacts before

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:37,040
as usual it's paul behraf as

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,079
before everything it's always

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:45,839
again the task so let's check it

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,839
if it was okay

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,119
this

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,520
so we got some repositories

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,440
so i would call the repository endpoint

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,800
with modify

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,119
and use add content units

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,119
and put our uploaded package

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,800
not the artifact but that content like

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:18,720
python package because we already

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,280
worked with that okay again it's tasked

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,320
because

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,640
it's better to do it like the task uh

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,599
for example if you will be uploading

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,520
like package

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,760
which will have like 100 megabytes you

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,480
don't want to wait

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,359
until it will upload so let's complete

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,000
it you see

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,359
it's the repository versions too as i

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,920
mentioned before

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,880
and here i will create a publication

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,079
again

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,720
but i don't want i don't use

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,880
the repository version as before but i

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,119
can specify just the repository

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,000
which automatically the latest one will

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,040
be taken so

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,920
now we go to the version two so second

00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,920
will be taken

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:11,839
again the task so let's check it

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,720
so we got a publication and we don't

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,920
have to

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,119
for example now you can do the new

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,400
uh distribution but there is possibility

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:26,160
we can update our existing run so

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,160
let's do it with that one

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,960
i'll just check for the path

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:37,839
and just i want to end here

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,839
we don't use the update but put method

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,240
and you specify your distribution you

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,920
have to specify again the name

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,800
base path so we can use the same one

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,119
and now we use the publication the newly

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,240
a

00:37:51,119 --> 00:38:05,839
new creator created one so that

00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:05,839
publication from version two

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:19,440
it's completed and we can check

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:22,320
our content up

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,359
that our new package was added there is

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
about python

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,160
and it because this is the simple view

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,440
there will be just one that packages we

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,119
uploaded

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,079
and we are pretty out of time so

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,240
i can just say if you got any question

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,839
just

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,520
ask here on the chat or there is a lot

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,880
of channels if you are

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,920
interested in it there is few links for

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,680
the documentation

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,800
our main page is called project.org

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,680
that there is you here you will find

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,800
all the demos documentation links github

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,079
links and

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,359
even the block and like these other ways

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,000
how to contact us

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,760
it's the pulp list like male increased

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,880
on redhead or irc

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,160
on free notes like

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,440
pulp or we are all

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,560
also on the metrics uh here are

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,680
few youtube videos there is

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,920
uh more described the workflows and more

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,839
demos about pulp how you can use it if

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,839
python is not enough for you

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,680
and i think that's pretty it so any

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,119

here the installation is and we

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,240
mentioned this

00:39:51,040 --> 00:40:05,680
