Title: Words Matter - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-14
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speakers: Josip Vilicic, Eliane Pereira



Open source technology is better, faster, and more creative because of the diverse perspectives and experiences that are represented in its communities. If open source is truly meant to be inclusive and a place where anyone can participate, it must be welcoming to all.

If any person or groups of people feel unwelcome because of the language being used in a community, code or documentation, then the words should change. We can choose words that are precise, not dependent on metaphors, and convey messages without negative connotations.

We will discuss the process of auditing our own work - our code, documentation and content - and identifying potentially divisive language. We will also talk about methods to standardize replacements and collaborate with writers and developers to carry out these changes in a sustainable way.

Working to eradicate problematic language from our open source code and documentation is just one action in a larger effort of diversity and inclusion. For open source to continue to be the best way to create better solutions faster, we must break down any barrier that could potentially inhibit participation and make the documentation and development process more inclusive for all.

hello everyone and thank you for joining

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,200

words matter so we're going to talk

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,639
about how promoting inclusion

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,440
documentation and projects can build a

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,240
better

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,480
user experience for our communities so

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,520
my name is eliane i'm a technical writer

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,279
and co-presenting to this uh my name is

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,160
joseph villasec i'm also a technical

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,240
writer

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,680
and i've worked with elian before thank

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,199
you

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,519
so today we're going to talk about

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,360
next slide please thank you we're going

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,600
to talk about inclusion

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,040
what's the problematic language why you

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,920
should care about the problematic

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,760
language

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
what are the benefits from promoting

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
inclusion in our documentation

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
projects also what kind of a position we

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,200
may face when trying to change things

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,280
and why you may find insensitiveness

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
when trying to make the changes

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,000
then we're going to discuss a possible

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,359
path for adopting the inclusive language

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,559
and what are the next steps we can take

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,760
and then we're going to share some

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,840
resources if you are interested in

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,439
learning more about conclusion

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
so we are going to cover a lot but bear

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,840
with us

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,200
so uh let's start first talking about

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,400
inclusion what does inclusion have to do

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,360
with this conversation

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
why is it important

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,360
next slide please so

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
inclusion is important because it has to

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
do with being open

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
and us as part of an open source

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,759
community community

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,920
are part of this our cto at red hat

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
who is right committed by a twitter who

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
eradicates the harmful language

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
from the open source and with that

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
bringing more diverse into the community

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,479
collaboration

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,479
let's slide this

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,759
thank you so inclusion has always to do

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,759
with empathy

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,200
because if someone feels uncomfortable

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,479
with the language they are seeing our

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,880
documentation

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,079
our websites were called we need to

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,320
change this language

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,360
so everyone feels welcome and

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,799
comfortable

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,799
this is how you show empathy

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,560
next is life please and why is

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,080
what's stamped so empathy it's the

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
ability to place yourself

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,879
in other person's position and be able

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,800
to understand there is experience

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,360
empathy is a skill that you can learn

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,599
actively and how you can do that

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
you can do that by listening to your

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,840
colleagues experience and point of view

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,599
by trusting their perspectives by

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
actively listening and trying to take

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,840
others perspective instead of yours

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,319
and especially by recognizing what's

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,319
wrong and making the right choice

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,560
and now over to your job thank you leon

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,720
and really quickly i'm just going to

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:51,840
quit that chat program so it doesn't

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,840
pop up again

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
everybody still see my slides yes

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
excellent thank you

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
um so elian brought up a problematic

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
language

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,599
what exactly is problematic language in

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,440
short it's words that can push people

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,519
away

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,120
the actual definition is words or

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
phrases that have specific

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,680
derogative meaning towards a specific

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,920
marginalized group of people

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
but that's still abstract so what are we

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,920
talking about in

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,800
in our software world well we're talking

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,799
about

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,080
going through our code our documentation

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
and our web properties

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
and replacing this problematic language

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,480
this is a statement that red hat

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
announced

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,000
we're just using red hat as a very good

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
example of a

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,319
of an organization that is taking a

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,000
stance against this language

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
the four words that we're talking about

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,040
are master slave

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,200
black list and white list and

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,799
the company did also recognize that it's

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,319
going to be a big effort

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
so it will be something that happens

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
over time

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,799
now if you've never come across these

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,640
words you may be wondering how they're

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
being used

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
well for example the word master could

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,680
be used as you can only make changes

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,720
on the master server so what is the

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,879
intention behind that it's it's meant to

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,640
convey some sort of an authority like a

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319
controlling process

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,239
but the only way that we have that

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,439
meaning of the word is based on the

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,440
historical meaning

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,479
that a master is a man who has people

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
working for him

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,000
especially servants or slaves

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
the word slave gets used as kind of like

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,080
a subordinate process

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,160
like the slave dns zone is a read-only

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
copy of a master zone

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
again the only way that we get to

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
communicate that subordinate process

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
is because of the historical meaning of

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,960
the word slave someone that's forced to

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,800
obey and is treated as legal property

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,520
the other two words whitelist and

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
blacklist are used to convey whether

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,639
something should be allowed or denied

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
access

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
for example add the ip address of your

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
servers to the whitelist

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,320
now the only way that we have that is

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,800
because

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,840
the word white list is used to convey

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,560
things that are considered

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,360
acceptable or trustworthy on the

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
opposite hand

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,120
devices that are blacklisted will not be

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,639
used

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
that means that those things should be

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,080
denied access

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,840
we're saying that those things are

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,520
unacceptable and untrustworthy and

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,400
should be excluded

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,360
directly relating the word black to bad

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,360
and white to good

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,000
so why should we care elian

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,360
thank you so by now we may

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,120
ask why should i care about this so

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,199
we may care because this is everyone

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,240
problem and because the language we use

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,160
will impact the way we think so

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
because words can impact and bring

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
consequences to people

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,520
and people whatever makes an

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,520
organization and without people's

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,080
collaboration there is no organization

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,759
and also the use of harmful language can

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,120
impact our communities

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,680
and how we may ask so it can be

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,360
barriers for contribution because people

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,199
with different backgrounds

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,039
and different needs may not feel willing

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,319
to contribute to certain projects

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,400
if you want safe or unwelcome or

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
it can also can bring barriers to

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
adoption of technology being developed

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,840
by the community

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,319
because people may feel excluded and not

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,639
willing to contribute to such a project

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,240
and also it can limit the growth because

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,160
fewer people are contributing and

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
adopting the technology developed by

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,280
certain projects

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
let's slide this

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,600
so here's a quote from caroline kuranja

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,479
she's a

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
self-talk developer and she came across

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,479
harmful language

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
while committing her quote and it made

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,800
her feel

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
really uncomfortable because she was

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
seeing that she was engaged with harmful

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,080
language

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,880
against black people and it made her

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,639
think that

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,280
this kind of offensive language should

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,319
not be in cult

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,880
next slide please okay

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
so uh now we have a little understanding

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
about why you should care about

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,080
inclusive

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,080
and harmful language and let's talk

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,560
about the benefits of adopting

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,960
inclusive terms in your documentation or

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,000
your community for your projects

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,479
so you can benefit from the day first so

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,199
it will bring people with different

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,120
backgrounds

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
knowledge and experience to your

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,400
community

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
you can also benefit from inclusion

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
because you're breaking

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,720
language barriers you are breaking

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
technology barriers

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,800
and it will make people feel welcome and

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,599
safe by knowing that they will not face

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,599
any obstacle when trying to contribute

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,680
and you can also benefit from growth and

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,440
adoption because the technology

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,039
developed by the companies and open

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,840
source communities

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,199
can be developed by heterogeneous groups

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,280
and they can create better solutions

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,440
and now for example people such as

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,120
caroline that we quoted before

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,879
would be interest and contribute to your

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,319
community without feeling that

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,479
they will engage in harmful language

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
however be aware that bringing diverse

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,160
is not enough if you are not practicing

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,000
inclusion

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:11,360
and also it's not enough if if you are

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,319
benefiting people from inclusion and

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,160
you are not bringing equity to them so

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,479
this will make people

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,000
have access to the same opportunities

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,720
and they will start to contribute and

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
communities can grow

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,240
so next slide please so

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
uh let's start excluding the exclusive

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,599
language

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,159
for example instead of saying that you

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,519
are making changes into the master serve

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,399
why not saying that you are making

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,440
changes into the management serve

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
or instead of saying that the slave dns

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
zone

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,120
is read only cop of a master zone

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
how about saying that the secondary dna

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,080
zone it's really only

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,839
of a primary sun and note here that

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,320
we are using different terms to replace

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,160
master this is an example that you can

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
adapt the replacement in a way that

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,360
suits your project better

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,000
and the same goes with uh the phrase

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,640
device

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,800
being part of whitelist of a blacklist

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,480
those could be easily replaced by saying

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,240
that devices are part of the include

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,160
list and the block list

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
and the phrase still understandable and

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,800
clear

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,600
and now over to joe again

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,519
thank you elian uh so she just

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,959
illustrated that it could be pretty easy

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,240
to make these changes

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
um but uh we've uh come across some

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,200
arguments

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
against opposing uh sorry against making

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
changes and you may also

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,160
come across dialogue where people

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
are just resistant to take these things

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,440
into consideration

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,680
and consider this viewpoint so they may

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,160
say do we really need to change it

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680
and uh let's talk about that we'd like

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
to bring up four common arguments

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,200
against change

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,240
that you may hear brought to you if you

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
bring this up

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,560
and what we would also like to bring up

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,399
um this is a very simplifying metaphor

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,240
uh but we think it might illustrate a

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,399
little bit of empathy

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,800
imagine somebody steps on your foot and

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,640
it does hurt

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,880
so the first kind of category would be

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
denial um somebody is saying

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,320
you know i don't think these words are

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
offensive or racist or uh

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
just some people just get too offended

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,519
get offended too easily

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
that's comparable to you saying that

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,959
hurts and the other person just saying

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,760
no it doesn't the result is that they're

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,240
denying another person's boundaries

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
so to that we say that one person's lack

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,360
of an experience

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,200
does not invalidate somebody else's

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,200
experience somebody else's reality

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,079
uh the second kind of category that we

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,839
come across is a doubts about scope

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,440
somebody's saying uh you know if we

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,560
change this one thing do we have to

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,000
change the other

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,600
where does it end or just thinking that

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
it doesn't apply to them like

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,279
this isn't a problem in my area of the

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,959
world it doesn't apply to us it's

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,360
somebody else's issue

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,640
that's like you saying that hurts any

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,000
other person saying

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,560
not me the result is distancing from the

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
issue

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,640
and it's seeking to dismiss it so to

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,480
that we would say

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,600
this does affect you because it affects

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
your community

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
the third kind of category that we've

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,440
heard is uh

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,680
people claiming it's difficult or

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,399
inefficient like somebody's saying

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,959
uh the old words were okay uh finding

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,120
different words will be too confusing

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,560
or uh this could be a waste of time i

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,279
have more important things to work on

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
especially if we're talking about code

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,399
well

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,600
that's like you saying that hurts and

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,959
they'll then the other person just

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
saying well just give up why

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,920
why do anything about it

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,720
we would say to that is that some of the

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,480
changes could be simple replacements

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
but the harder changes there are a lot

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
of people that are very willing to do

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
this

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
to do the work especially the harder

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
work

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,360
so uh we do say that listening is worth

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,959
the effort

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,959
and we think it's a good idea

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,040
the fourth common argument that we hear

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,120
is about personal freedom

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,160
somebody saying uh while outlawing these

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
words is censorship

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
and that's not something that i stand

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
for that's comparable to you saying

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
that hurts and the other person just

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,240
saying well it's my right to do this

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,360
uh the result is that this is confusing

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,040
the issue

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
nobody here nobody at this whole

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
conference very few people are

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,959
supporting

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
political repression of free speech what

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,240
we're talking about

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
is voluntary language at work there are

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,320
a lot of things you wouldn't say at work

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,519
so we're saying that this extends to

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,600
these kinds of work

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,839
to these four words and that kind of

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,680
language

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,760
you may not be fired for using these

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,480
words you may not be arrested for using

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
these words

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,240
nobody's going to take away your

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,600
keyboard but people may not

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,720
choose to collaborate with you there

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,720
could be social impacts

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,399
so we're we're starting to see a pattern

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,839
of insensitivity here

00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,880
where the community brings up concerns

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,600
but it's met with a lack of trust

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,399
that are dismissive and then it argues

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,600
for inaction

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,920
why why is there that insensitivity why

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
not

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
change the status quo the way that

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,399
things are right now

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,480
so before we go any further we do want

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,480
to clarify our intent

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,519
we're going to discuss racism which is a

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,279
very complex and sensitive topic

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
but as we were working on this talk we

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,079
recognized that we couldn't talk about

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,880
inclusion

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,399
the what the of this talk and the

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
process of changing it

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,800
or removing that problematic language

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,399
the how without truly addressing the

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,000
reason that we're in the situation

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,760
the why we should always be talking

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
about the why

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,480
so we have researched this topic but

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
we're by no means experts

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,920
there are a lot of people that devote

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,360
their whole life to this uh so we

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,959
definitely defer to them

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
but we're acting in allyship with the

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,800
black community and we feel this is a

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,680
very important conversation

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,399
that we want to help push forward so

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,720
we'd like to

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,240
express our point of view directly in a

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,880
way that we hope you find clear and

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
constructive

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,760
and we'd also like to share our

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:16,000
perspectives and biases so we know where

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:18,480
we're coming from

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
i have a hispanic background or latin

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
background

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,600
uh the pronouns are her or she i'm

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,199
originally from brazil

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
and currently living in brainerd czech

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,839
republic

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
and i'm joseph bilasik i know i'm not

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,920
pronouncing that

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,279
in czech properly but uh i'm also

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,800
hispanic uh

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,560
and i found out it's i'm pretty much

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,240
white passing which means that

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,639
i'm very light-skinned and so i don't uh

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,480
come across the same kind of uh racism

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,839
that darker skin hispanic and black

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,800
people go through

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,680
um my pronouns are he and him and i was

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,000
born in chile

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,079
to chilean and yugoslavian parents but

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,839
then i moved to miami and now i'm in

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
raleigh north carolina united states

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,920
so we would like to talk about that path

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,480
to insensitivity

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,079
which starts on an individual basis this

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,120
is usually the common

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,480
kind of scenario that we hear

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,160
starting from the individual and then

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,680
going to the group

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,199
so uh individuals we have biases biases

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,600
in themselves are not a bad thing

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,399
it's just a tendency to prefer one thing

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
over another

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,519
such as in-group bias if you have to

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,040
work on a project

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,959
you would probably end up choosing

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
people that you've worked with before

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,199
because they're already in your group

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,320
your group is safer it definitely has

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,040
advantages you know as even as a safety

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,399
survival thing the thing is biases

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,720
become an issue

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
when they become prejudice when they are

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,240
irrational biases

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,000
that inform negative emotions or

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
judgments about people

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
from other social groups and let's focus

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,040
on that word irrational we will be

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
coming back to that

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,120
and address what is feeding that

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,120
irrationality

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,519
when we take these ideas and collect

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,440
them into behaviors

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,279
then we start acting on that prejudice

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,880
that is discrimination

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,720
that's when we treat other minority

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,560
members negatively

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,240
based on irrational biases prejudice

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,399
and if we start collecting these

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,160
behaviors and perhaps collecting them

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,079
with others

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,240
that starts turning into a culture of

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,240
racism which would be discrimination

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
based on race

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,399
discriminating against others based on

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
beliefs of racial superiority

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,079
usually one's own racial superiority

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,720
over somebody else's

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,320
but also you could be a white

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,920
supremacist without being white

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,680
that's also a very complex subject

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,199
so we could be talking about this and

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
you could be saying or you could be

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,959
thinking i agree

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,320
racist racism is terrible but i'm not a

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,199
racist so it's a good thing i'm not a

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,440
racist

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,680
only bad ignorant hateful other people

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,600
do these racist things

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,160
well we'd like to talk about the dangers

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
of also blaming the other

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
most people see themselves as good

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,240
people i know i do elian's amazing i'm

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,280
sure she also thinks she's great

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
but the thing is if we see if good

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
people see

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,160
others as responsible for racism

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,079
especially over racism

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,880
just visible hate we end up thinking

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,679
that

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
racism is somebody else's problems and

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,039
we don't see

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,319
how we actually participate in racist

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
systems

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,799
perhaps not over racism but racist

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,320
systems we don't see the connection

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,960
between systemic racism racism in a

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,919
system

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
and individual biases and discrimination

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,640
so

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
the ultimate result is that good people

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,679
like you and i

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,240
end up not doing anything to change bad

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,320
policies and systems

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,799
so let's look into that word systemic

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,799
racism

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,160
it's something that distorts individual

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,039
thought now the thing is uh

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,240
the foundation of racism is not uh

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,799
ignorance and hate

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,760
but it's actually self-interest usually

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,480
economic political or cultural

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,960
that people have taken and distorted to

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,480
set up

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,280
institutions that carry out systemic

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,679
racism

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,679
uh systemic racism is racism that's

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
embedded as a normal practice within a

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,200
society

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,320
or an organization and its true purpose

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,600
is to acquire

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,480
and keep power and the way that it does

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,160
that

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,640
is by influencing individuals uh it

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,440
starts

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,400
informing implicit biases attitudes or

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,640
stereotypes that

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,039
unconsciously affect our understanding

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,440
our actions and our decisions

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,360
we usually wonder how racist people got

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,280
that way

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,640
it didn't start from the bottom up it

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,120
actually started top down

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,080
racial discrimination has led to racist

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,880
ideas

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,320
which leads to that ignorance and hate

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
implicit bias the fact that it's

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,240
unconscious

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,039
that's what feeds that irrational bias

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,720
that turns into prejudice

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,039
so we would say let's get back to that

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,280
empathy which is a learned skill so it

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,600
does take practice and effort

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,120
but if we trust what people are telling

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,799
us if we assume that they have good

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
intent and that they're speaking their

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,000
truth

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,919
if we truly listen to them and and

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,320
censor them focus them

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,039
focus on them and imagine if their

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,120
experience was ours

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,840
we have no choice but to act and do the

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,840
right thing

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
the impact of an action is much greater

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,880
than its intent

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,640
and so good intelligent loving people

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
they do have biases

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,679
they can act out prejudice and they

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,200
could contribute to systemic racism

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,080
one thing that might be helpful is that

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,160
racist is an adjective it's not a noun

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,600
there are very few people that are truly

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,240
a racist

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,000
but they could do racist things and then

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,240
you can fix that you have the power to

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
change

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
elion

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,320
so now that we have a better

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,200
understanding of why we think that words

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,280
matter

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,520
and now that you are aware that you may

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,200
face some problems when trying to adopt

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,960
the conscious language

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,280
let's talk about the process to move

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,840
away from this problematic language

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,720
so uh here i'm proposing a suggested

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
path

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,640
and try to change process and it will go

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,960
over some phases

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,000
so we have the preparation phase a

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,480
planning phase

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,600
the assessment phase performing the

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,640
change itself

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,840
and the maintenance phase so let's

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,440
start with the preparation phase and by

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,080
this time

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,159
it will involve company accountability

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,440
so remember chris wright redirects to

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,080
announcements

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,159
and also people engagement so they were

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
looking to be called documentation and

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
what the

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,960
to identify harmful language and from

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,159
those sources

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,039
you will find how much work they have to

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,039
do

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,799
and by this time blue notes that you may

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,960
find difficult to change harmful

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,640
languages or processing tools

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,360
these are the most difficult to change

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,240
but they are not impossible

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,640
so we can go to the next phase it will

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,360
be

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,400
the assessment that will be the first

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,280
step

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,960
so how did the work you have to do

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,159
identify the harmful language on the

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,400
documentation

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,080
on the contents and this includes

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
website internal procedures

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
communication

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,760
and you can use a simple graphic comment

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,320
so you can identify occurrence of

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,559
harmful language in your sources

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,080
then you are going to determine what

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,640
words will replace

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,400
the harmful language so make sure you

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,039
have consistent

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,200
uh maybe you want to consult with your

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,760
community and also with developers to

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
understand

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,159
what's the most appropriate replacement

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,559
and once you have agreements

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,679
document it and make everyone aware of

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,799
the terms you

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,720
create and you have to replace those in

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,520
the harmful language

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,720
and then you can start by changing

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
what's relatively

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,240
easy to change the online content in the

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,320
documentation

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
for example uh you're going to replace

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,320
occurrence of white list with include

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,120
list

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,600
and then we have the next step that it's

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,640
about

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,280
changing things on code so you're going

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,799
to

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,640
ask this impact of changing

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,360
hyperlanguage there

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,200
and as it can affect for example api

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,600
products configuration

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,960
or even the internal development you

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
want to make sure that you are

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,720
establishing

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,960
a roadmap for example so we can have a

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,080
clear deprecation schedule

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,320
and with that you have a period of time

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
in which both the new and old terms will

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,280
work

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,440
but was using the whole term would

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,280
result in a warning initially

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
and by the end you are going to have an

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,360
error message

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,679
while it's not interrupts differentiate

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,000
so

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,720
you can inform about the deprecation and

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,880
release notes for example

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,480
and for example let's say you have a

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
function that you use to call an

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,600
external library

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
and that function contain words that you

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,360
want to replace

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,120
for that you can use for example a

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,039
wrapper function around it

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,480
this will allow you to fix the problem

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,320
in your own code

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,919
while you are still calling the function

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
with the problematic language in the

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,400
external code

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,280
and also it will give you a quick path

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,600
later on

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,559
to discard the wrapper when the external

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,480
code also gets fixed

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,840
and then we can go to the maintenance

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,960
phase

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,480
and this will consist of tests a kit

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,000
with ongoing village ones

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,679
so make sure that the changes

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
uh are not breaking anything in

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,840
production for example

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,440
um also ensure that the harmful language

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,360
will not return in the project

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,799
or the documentation because that will

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,000
require a second before

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,400
change also include

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,400
the language choice in your code styles

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,559
so mention to the new contributors

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,840
that is what you are expecting and

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,840
enforce it

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,760
make it part of the review for example

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,559
so it can be caught

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,919
and have a documentation that explains

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,799
why it matters or

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,240
pointed to our internal resources on why

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,559
we're changing

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
and finally you want to run assessments

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,919
tools regularly

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,480
to ensure that the harmful stems are

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,320
gone you will not return

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,600
and with that i pass to you again joe

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,559
thank you elian so

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,240
let's talk about what's next um now that

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,600
we've talked about

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,600
the harmful language that we've

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,799
suggested changing and some of the

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,440
processes

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,279
well we can always do more um and we do

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
want to bring up a content warning

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,279
there could be potentially triggering

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
language on the next slide

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,120
we have a lot of opportunities for

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,080
inclusive language

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,520
such as gender a lot of times a lot of

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,600
documentation and speech

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,679
defaults to he as the default gender

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,720
we would say let's just leave that out

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,919
let's talk about

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,960
the administrator as opposed to he

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,919
or if people try to be inclusive they

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,880
take a step further

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,799
and say he or she but a lot of people

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,080
are not he or she

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,960
so moving away from just binary genders

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,760
and also just using the word guys when

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,279
they truly mean

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,279
everybody or everyone

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,520
that's essentially the the summary of

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,840
this part like when we talk about

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,799
people using ableist language or

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,600
language that doesn't

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,200
respect neurodiversity if you truly

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,400
don't mean the word on the left

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,000
and you mean the word on the right let's

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,200
try to use the word on the right that

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,240
doesn't have

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,799
the negative connotations uh

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
that the word on the left does so drug

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,279
references

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,320
uh violent or martial language or words

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,840
that appropriate

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,000
cultures or religions

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,799
again if we're truly trying to use the

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,799
word on the right

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,080
metaphors are great but let's make sure

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,520
that we use metaphors that are

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,640
clarifying metaphors

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,600
as opposed to metaphors that obscure the

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,600
true meaning

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,039
and then you have to end up clarifying

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,000
what that metaphor means

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,480
instead of just using the better word to

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
begin with

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,080
also there are additional ways besides

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,080
just the language to be inclusive

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,440
we can take steps to try to maximize

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,400
psychological safety

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,039
such as creating an environment where

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,120
people

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,120
are encouraged to be creative and

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,120
there's no bullying

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,120
we all make mistakes but if we celebrate

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,320
mistakes as a chance to

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,520
learn and grow we're not saying you know

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,919
if somebody makes a mistake it's a

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,440
mistake but uh

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,200
sometimes those are the best lessons

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,600
that we learn and trying to focus on

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
that

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,440
make it something constructive instead

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,120
of a punishment

00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,159
also accessibility a lot of people do

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
use screen readers and if we put urls in

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,760
the middle

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,440
of a paragraph screen readers completely

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,799
destroy that paragraph by reading out

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,919
the url

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,799
so we would say you could take steps to

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,000
restructure your content a little bit

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,480
putting urls at the end also

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,240
putting image alternate text describing

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,080
what the image is

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
so that if you're not able to view the

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,000
image you still know what's going on

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,559
because you probably included that image

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,880
to convey something very important

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
similarly also including subtitles and

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,320
videos

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
so that if you're not able to hear the

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,760
audio

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,760
you still get everything that's going on

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,039
also respecting neurodiversity everybody

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,600
has different abilities and capacities

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,039
regarding attention or processing

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,000
written words

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,159
and so making sure that uh that you're

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,440
including people

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,679
100 inclusion may not be possible

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,240
but there's really no reason to be okay

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,360
with being exclusive

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,360
because inclusion is open

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,480
thank you joe so uh now we would like to

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,000
share some resource if you are

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,399
interested in learning more about the

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,640
the content we're presenting here

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,919
so uh first i would like to recommend

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
this video from dr

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,080
robert robert d'angelo so

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,640
she's an anti-racist educator and the

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,720
fact that

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,640
she's a white person and coming first in

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,120
this list is just because she addressed

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,880
resistance from the white's perspective

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,279
and we are aware that she's not an

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,159
author as a black person would be

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,000
but uh dr robin d'angelo helped break

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,960
some defense barriers for those who are

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,520
getting contact

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,399
subjects for the first time anything

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,440
would you like to

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,159
mention joe uh yeah um thank you for

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,919
bringing that up

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,399
uh exactly we we listed robert d'angelo

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,440
uh her work uh first in the videos and

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,720
the books

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,640
because uh we've even personally found

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,919
it that it's very constructive

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,120
to tear down the initial apprehension

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
that white people have to discussing

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
these things

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,520
it's very difficult to learn if you

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,159
still have your defenses up

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,799
so it almost feels like uh doing that

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,840
work is

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,640
uh it's a good opening

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,360
to truly be able to listen to uh the

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,640
works of

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,399
our black community like dr candy's work

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,240
how to be anti-racist and stand for the

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,520
beginning are amazing books

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,159
that how to be anti-racist gives you

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,679
great tools to be able to use out in the

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,919
real world

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,039
and stand from the beginning it gives a

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,279
lot of history

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,279
to how slavery came about

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,840
thank you so we also have some articles

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,559
that would like to share and with

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,600
attention to

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,559
dr abraham candy again it's a great

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,840
article

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,720
and also um the the one we used

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,159
and based our presentation it's great as

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,600
well

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,840
and what else we can go to next slide

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,840
please

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,480
thank you so uh we have some

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,600
organizations that would like to

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,120
highlight

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,399
so we have that red hat some great

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,760
organizations such as the black united

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,799
leadership in diverse so it's a

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,360
community for red hat and

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,720
their allies we also have the winning

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,640
leadership community

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,559
that promotes a posted contribution to

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,559
the next generation of women leaderships

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,799
and open source

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,480
we also have the red hat native and

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,559
indigenous community

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,559
to increase the presence and opportunity

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,919
and technology of native americans

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,000
and indigenous people the asian network

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,039
community for red hat associates across

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,600
the world

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,919
with a heritage or that identified on

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,880
the counters in asia

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,159
also we have units it's a cultural

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,159
awareness

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,519
around the latin or hispanic community

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,919
at redhead

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,120
the pride community to connect support

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,120
and empower the

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,120
lgbt bus and their allies

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,880
the neurodiversity community to

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,399
celebrate and empower the red hatters

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,080
with communicative

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,799
differences and also we have some

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,039
articles

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,159
to learn more about inclusions on open

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,080
source

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
and also we would like to mention some

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,480
open source resource

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,000
for example naming project with

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,559
recommendations and tools

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,039
for inclusiveness uh the outreach

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,960
project

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,640
that promotes diverse and inclusion by

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,120
bringing opportunities to join open

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,480
source

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,279
internships and also this github

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,440
repository called awesome dive first

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,320
with plenty of open source projects and

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,600
communities that welcome their first

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,679
and you will talk about the last one

00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,000
yeah we'd also like to mention uh just

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,600
to jump back up to the red hat resources

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,960
rich bowen came up with a great

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,399
presentation called welcoming

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,640
nomenclature

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,360
that definitely informed a good chunk of

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,360
this presentation

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,399
so going to the bottom in the interact

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,120
in interactive section uh

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,200
the harvard implicit association test is

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,600
a really really amazing thing

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,360
um if you can go there you can take an

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,320
implicit bias test

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,840
to test race age or gender uh lots of

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,640
different tests

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,399
to basically just see and help you

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,519
recognize some of the implicit biases

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,200
that you have

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,559
it's really really surprising we

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,640
recommend taking

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,120
any implicit tests they're very

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,120
constructed

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,320
so we'd like to thank you and see if

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:50,159
there's any questions or comments

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,799
yes questions or there are questions

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,559
rather

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,480
um let's start from the beginning um

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,760
fury asks if the logic behind

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,600
determining what's

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,760
in sensitive language if someone takes

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,000
offense to it how do we agree

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,960
on what should we take an action on

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,960
given that almost

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,960
some everything can offend someone

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,200
um to that i would say uh listening to

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,799
the community

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,320
and so um if 10 people

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,760
tell you that something's an issue and

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,200
only one person tells you that something

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,240
else is an issue

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,000
um perhaps prioritizing

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,679
you know what 10 people may be telling

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,799
you but also

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,960
listening to the one person um

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,320
again it's it's trusting that when

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,880
people are speaking up

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:42,559
that it's coming from a good place

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,320
okay uh antonio asks is there a service

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,760
or someone we could reach out to to

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,000
clarify

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,519
uh sorry as people are adding new

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,320
questions the screen is

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,679
uh jumping around so i'm like ah anyway

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,440
antonio asks

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,440
is there a service or someone we can

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,320
reach out to the clarify when we are not

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,320
sure about a term

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,480
so uh anthony if you are

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,760
i will share with you this link so uh

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,000
it's a guide so we can have a lot of

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,359
information there i will share with you

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,639
in the link

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,800
so it's a github and you can

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,240
see what are the proposed replacements

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,399
they have

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,159
and also you can discuss or bring more

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,480
if you have any questions

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,200
so that's really nice thank you thank

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,040
you for your question

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,800
i think this actually also answers the

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
next one but i'll ask it anyway and see

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,679
if there's anything else that you could

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,599
come up with is there a global database

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,040
of terms or practices that projects

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,159
should avoid

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:51,200
or such a thing as an inclusion linter

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,720
yes so uh this is around the community

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,560
so it's something that should be

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,200
bring to the community and should have

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,359
uh a discussion around it

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,880
so everyone will agree with them which

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,119
is the best term

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,119
i think that's that's it something else

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,000
you would like to add to

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,079
uh yeah exactly it seems like uh at the

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,480
moment that github repo

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,280
is where people are are doing some of

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,960
the collective

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,839
work um

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,320
that that seems to be the biggest one

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,079
because

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,400
i guess i guess people are recognizing

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,760
that it's important to agree

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,240
and then also it's like a bi-directional

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,560
thing

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,359
where people inform what sounds like a

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,280
good decision

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,440
commonly speaking and then people take

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,599
that and then recognize

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,920
got it but we may use you do it a little

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,040
differently in this area

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
and then checking with the community

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,079
again is that okay and if people say

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,320
it's okay

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,880
in a different way over here that also

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,880
seems to work

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,640
fantastic what's the best way to bring

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,680
inclusiveness to a community that

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,599
shields itself

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,320
with the prejudice being taken as part

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,320
of our culture

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,839
i think that's a difficult one but uh i

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,440
think the only way it's just

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,200
bringing the knowledge about what

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,040
the kind of language could cause to

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,440
people that

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,880
could be one person that may feel uh

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,200
harmed by that

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
and that's there is could be someone

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,079
that

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,599
are not feeling welcomed by that so

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,760
bring the discussion

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,280
so people will start to open to that and

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,000
start to learn

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,760
something you would like to add to uh

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,920
yeah that does sound like a very very

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,280
tough question so i guess

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,040
i would say that there's probably people

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,000
that have much better

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,599
uh answers than us for that if we're

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,560
talking about the interests of two

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,560
cultures clashing

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,560
yeah that sounds very complex and so

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,400
hopefully there could be a dialogue

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,839
to get to a point where that could be

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,119
worked out

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,119
um i'm not sure if there's an impasse

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,480
thanks all right any tips on finding out

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,599
what words are problematic

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,440
especially for non-us racism i feel the

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,839
english-speaking community is default to

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,839
u.s

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,920
i guess having facilitating a way to

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,920
receive that feedback

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,119
because i suppose uh a lot of people

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,480
that use harmful language

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,599
have no idea that it is harmful and so

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
the important thing is uh listening when

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,960
people do let you know

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,640
and so if nobody's letting you know that

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
there's problematic language

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,800
then i suppose a conscientious thing to

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,359
do would be to facilitate receiving that

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,000
feedback

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,000
in the first place

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,839
okay final question is from martin

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,520
do you see any language guideline

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,119
conflicts when you encounter people

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,640
coming from different cultural and

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,720
language environments

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,520
after all most of the movements focus on

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,560
english language use

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,359
that's true we see that our difference

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,400
and what could be harmful to someone

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,160
would not be to

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:16,000
other nationalities for example

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,560
and but mostly we try to advise and try

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,200
to find

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,760
uh what our other people are doing for

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,480
example

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,400
so uh for example for whitelist and

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,760
blacklist most people are following the

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,240
same path so

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,119
we would say follow the same or you can

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,320
bring this

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,520
discussion to your community something

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,520
you would like to add joe

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,280
no not really it it really just seems

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,320
to just go back to listening to your

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,400
immediate community

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,160
and then making sure that that is also

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,599
um that still respects the larger

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,880
community and then the larger community

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,800
after that

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,560
um yeah just recognizing boundaries and

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,440
respecting them

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,480
different people have different

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,520
boundaries and so we have to

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,079
defer to the

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,280
most vulnerable population or the most

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,640
vulnerable community

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,560
and make sure that their boundaries are

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,839
not being ignored for the sake of

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,160
somebody else's

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,680
boundaries okay we have one more

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,760
question that i'll ask and then we

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,599
need to wrap up so the final question is

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,359
how to deal with embargo

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,800
what if someone cannot contribute to a

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,200
project due to where they're

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,040
where they live is this a thing were

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,480
these things ever included in

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,480
contributing documentation

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,520
i know that uh there are some kind of

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,800
embargoes to

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,320
some countries but i don't have the

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,720
answer with me

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,160
at the moment i can research the topic

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,119
and try to bring to you

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,200
if it's okay or if you would like to to

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,119
bring something

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,880
no no i have nothing that's great it

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,960
seems they definitely

00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,240
uh we have to follow laws

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,720
yeah matthew maybe we could take it

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,800
offline just because i'm having trouble

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,800
truly uh grasping the the scenario

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
it was submitted by anonymous too so i'm

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,599
not even sure we can follow

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,599
up with that person as we don't know who

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,520
asked but perhaps

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,599
we can continue the conversation on our

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,520
discord server and we can chat it out

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,000
and see if there's

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,760
some additional information that the

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
questioner can provide

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,760
and so i want to thank the both of you
