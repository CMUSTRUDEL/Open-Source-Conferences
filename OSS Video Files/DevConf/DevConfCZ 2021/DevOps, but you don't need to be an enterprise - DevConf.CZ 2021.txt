Title: DevOps, but you don't need to be an enterprise - DevConf.CZ 2021
Publication date: 2021-03-19
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2021
Description: 
	Speaker: Peter Malina


My heart skips a beat every time there's the *new tool that will solve your DevOps*. Working in a team, one can realize fairly fast that the tooling is not the problem most of the time. People are. In this talk, I want to zoom in on the possibilities of building a DevOps *culture*, instead of investing millions into tooling and wasting the time of people constantly re-learning new tools.

Agenda:
- The rabbit holes of DevOps
- No, DevOps is not a single person working for two
- Don't pick what you want, pick what you need
- Tools don't work autonomously - one tool at a time -
- How automation wastes time in certain situations
- Make a consensus

so hi everybody uh i'm peter

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
i'm google developer expert and i'm also

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,760
a co-founder of a company

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,759
called flow up uh we're a software

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,960
agency based in bruno

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,599
so this time i want to talk about devops

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
and

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
particularly devops for small teams and

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,640
just a disclaimer

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,439
to start with uh this is more of a

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,119
my experience it doesn't really mean

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,480
this is like the silver bullet that you

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
need to use

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
basically uh whatever you like take it

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,719
and use it whatever you don't

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,200
just leave it be uh i'll be very happy

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,160
for any feedback to this as well

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
so uh i want to start with a very simple

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,000
idea and that's

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,120
everything is literally bound to fail we

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
just don't know when

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,160
um and i think this is like a mantra uh

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
that

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,640
every devops or every every team that

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
devops is using should have

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
that we just don't know when things will

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,360
fail they

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
sometimes just will and we need to be

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,399
prepared and this is what the talk will

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,199
be about because

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,879
what we can call this is i call this a

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,479
property of fragility

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
some sometimes this is also called

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,920
robustness so

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
whatever you're trying to you know this

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,119
is the same scale uh just fragility os

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,600
on the left side

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,680
robustness is on the right side but what

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,759
i want to talk about here

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280
is basically that it's really hard to

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,320
make systems

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,960
robust without thinking about why they

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,720
are fragile and where they are fragile

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,360
so fragility has two parts or

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
from from what i know and from what i

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
experienced it has two parts

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,520
the first one is a static part and these

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,960
are things mechanical technical

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,200
meaning whatever code issues you have

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,399
known issues bottlenecks scaling issues

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,840
that you know of

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,840
and so on and so forth you can basically

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
think about your recent project

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
and see these technical issues like

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,439
right ahead like

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
where's the to-do that i have dude it's

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,079
like you know code mine somebody steps

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,320
on it and then everybody cries because

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
well somebody left something there and

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
forgot to implement something

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,640
but this is very static it doesn't

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,319
change in time uh if you leave it b

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,239
it has still the same chance that

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,760
somebody will step on it as it had when

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,760
you first wrote it

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
but then there's dynamic fragility and

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
this is what i want to talk about more

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,200
in this talk

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,400
which is which has four parts uh again

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
there can be more parts

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
based on your experience but from my

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,920
experience there are these four parts

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,000
the capacity of people the context of

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,400
people the scale of the system

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
and dependencies and other teams in

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,319
other words

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,480
capacity of people how much performance

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,200
or what we call performance we have

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,239
uh when and at what stage is in the

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
project

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,879
for example whatever skills we have or

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,760
whatever skills we gain in the process

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,680
context of people is something like

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,680
active maintenance meaning

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,959
i know what i'm doing in this part of

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,400
code or in this part of project

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,879
you can also see context as

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
i don't know uh if you're maintaining or

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,239
if you just wrote the code

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,360
you have a full context of the code you

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,440
wrote but

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
if you leave the code b for three months

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,640
or six months

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
you basically lose a lot of context and

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,080
now it takes a lot of time for you and

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,280
for other people to understand the same

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,440
stuff

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
scale of the system is something very

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,760
unpredictable most of the time

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
meaning you don't really know what will

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,599
happen tomorrow

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,200
or the other day it just you are you

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
just need to be kind of prepared

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,799
and you will never be prepared for this

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,959
not to the scale that

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,720
we all want and dependencies in other

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,680
people and you can talk about

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,319
uh libraries or you know things that are

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
technical

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,840
but in the end there are people behind

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
them so the fragility of the

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,560
dependencies

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,120
has or also has the same fragilities as

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
your own team meaning static and dynamic

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
and then there's like a big tree of

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640
these things

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
what i want to talk about the dynamic

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,480
ones is because

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
i genuinely believe that we are good at

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,680
seeing

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
the static fragilities in our projects

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
like you know these code mines

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
but we are very blind to the dynamic

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
ones

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680
meaning you can't really tell or

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,680
at least i can't really tell the

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,959
capacity of my people what what their

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,359
performance will be

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160
tomorrow or the day after well the

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,560
context is

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
did they actually look at the code or is

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
it everything just like you know i wrote

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,639
it i abandoned it and now it just sits

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
there

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
the scale of the system something we

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,199
can't really predict

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
very um well we can't really predict

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,520
that

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,160
and the dependencies uh which means how

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
do other teams actually work and what

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
they actually have you can actually

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,080
predict this like uh you can have some

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,560
numbers if you want to

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
uh i mean it's a very cool management

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
job if you want somebody to suffer

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,160
endlessly

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,479
uh just give them the to create a report

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
of

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,960
of these four things and they will

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,120
probably never create it or if they

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
create it they will be six months late

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,479
uh which is why i want to talk about

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
this

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,560
but the biggest property or the largest

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,759
property why i want to talk about it is

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
when you look at static and dynamic

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,320
fragilities

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
excuse me uh when you want to talk about

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,280
or when you when you look at static and

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
dynamic fragilities

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,479
you see that the static fragilities

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,800
never change or almost never change

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,320
don't scale very much but the dynamic

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,440
ones they tend to scale

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,880
when ignored meaning if you really

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,039
abandon something

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,160
that really scales with time in months

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,039
and years

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,120
where in some time you don't really know

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,759
what you did or nor your team knows

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
and when something happens it's just

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,400
like

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,520
hell just broke and you need to fix

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,759
things

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,360
and that's why this other graph and

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,639
these are all visualization this is not

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
a particular project

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,000
so this is what you may have experienced

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,560
or may have not

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
but the other graph tells us the story

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
of

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,520
features versus fixing or what this is

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,560
what the management calls it

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,759
the phase of you know bug hunting and

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,520
this is what will happen

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,440
or what may happen to your system when

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,919
you ignore the fragilities and

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
most of the things just happen and most

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,560
of the big booms in the systems just

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,400
happen because we ignore these

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,919
fragilities or the dynamic fragilities

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
of our systems

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,080
meaning you know we were not prepared

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
for the scale or somebody embed abandon

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
some

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
library or some part of the system now

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
we need to use that

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
and now there are bugs in that nobody

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,600
really remembers stuff

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,440
or we already have scheduled everything

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,919
and now nobody really has time to do

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,000
anything

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,600
else yet there is a big issue in the

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
system

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
and what happens like this is the

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,479
reality where you may actually get back

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
from this

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,319
if you use if you go with the the riot

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
graph you can actually

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,680
take this and it will still be okay

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
sometimes

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
but what's not okay is we sometimes

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,800
think we can do this

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,560
which means go above our capacity and

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,880
this is a graph that shows

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,800
that we go or we try to go above our

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,440
capacity but we can't

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
which means even if you try you're just

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,639
doing

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,759
all the things in half the quality or

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,599
enter the quality

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,960
without quality assurance without doing

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,960
real stuff

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,240
and actually creating just legacy and

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,919
burning out

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
this is something you should avoid at

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,720
all costs and i'm gonna talk about this

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,680
more

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
and about lessons i learned about this

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,880
so

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,599
um as i said how do we you may be right

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
now asking

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,599
so how do we track because if we can see

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,639
we can fix things right

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,759
so how do we actually track the dynamic

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,440
fragility

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,160
and the answer is we just don't and

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,160
if you're right now asking like why it's

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,479
because it's very hard to track

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
and it's not only very hard you can't

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
track that

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,080
until that happens that's why i said if

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,720
i want to give this somebody as a job

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,280
and let them suffer for like six months

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
without

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,400
any impact or doing really anything this

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,440
is a very

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,319
good opportunity because what happens is

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,720
you can only tell what the scale system

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,440
was

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,599
at when something happens and you need

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,800
to track this for months or sometimes

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,680
like weeks or even months to make sense

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
of the data

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,440
that's why it's not very good to

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,599
actually try to make sense

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,639
of the data you can backtrack that and

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,800
see

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,160
what the team was at for example three

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
months or six months

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,759
but at the same time the team is totally

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,599
different in three months or six months

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
which means it doesn't really make sense

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,919
to i mean if you want to collect these

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
data

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,440
you're free to free to collect them

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,320
right yeah it always makes sense to see

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,959
like the

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,880
how we behaved in the past at the same

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,919
time you shouldn't be

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,440
creating future plans based on these

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,120
dynamic fragilities

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,680
from the past and so

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,160
i wanna i wanna end this part this first

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,720
part of my presentation with uh with

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,440
this sim

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,200
single simple single uh simple quote

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
absence of evidence is not an evidence

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
of absence

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,160
meaning just because we didn't crash

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,959
until now doesn't mean we will not crash

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,640
tomorrow

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,080
and this is what dynamic fragilities are

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
all about just because

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,360
you don't have evidence of something

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,240
doesn't mean your system doesn't

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,920
have some issue in it and it may be your

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,440
mechanical technical system

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,560
or your process that you have in devops

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,959
so what do we do instead

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,760
uh we spend more time on minimizing the

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
potential

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,720
impact that the things have so

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,800
how do we do this and these these are my

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
lessons that i that i actually learned

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,160
uh during these four for five years and

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,399
as i said these

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,760
this may not be all and you can take

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,959
something and leave something else

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,839
behind

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,680
but these are the four lessons first

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
very multiple heads and i will i will be

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,839
talking about all of these

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,560
more in a second second maintain

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,680
actively

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,160
don't just abandon things three

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
learn valuable things and make sure you

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,480
understand the value

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,760
of the things is instead of looking at

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
some other

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,160
uh some other metrics and i will i will

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,200
talk about this later as well

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,680
and fight and discover don't stale

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
so let's talk about the first one wear

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,279
multiple heads and again

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,480
graphs are only just as a visual

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,320
representation

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
if you may have it very differently on

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
your own project

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,680
but make sure that you know that your

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,440
capacity is limited and

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,680
if you want to make sure if you want to

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,800
make things in a quality way

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,880
that they don't backfire uh next time

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
you touch them then you will need to

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,079
manage this and

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,360
wearing multiple heads is actually a

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,440
good way to manage your

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,360
own time because you already know the

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
process so you know how much time it

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
will actually take for you to develop

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
the thing to test the thing

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,920
and to release and deploy the thing

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,959
while making sure

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,959
it operates well in production

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,880
i know there are environments where this

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,079
isn't possible where the applications

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
are just too large

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,760
to do this but we're not talking about

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,680
the smaller teams and this is what you

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,399
should be aiming for what we are aiming

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
for

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,560
to make sure that people actually manage

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
their own capacity because we know what

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,399
happens

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
when people don't and we let uh

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,880
something like agile velocity do that

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,160
for us

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,680
which is i'm sorry but complete nonsense

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,120
uh then people get burnt out

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,640
and there's not really uh not really

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,480
much of a value

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,680
in creating such a capacity from like

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,079
third person

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,320
for somebody else the the person the

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,320
person himself or herself

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,800
needs to know their capacity

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
this creates a natural pressure and this

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,279
is a very cool point

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,800
uh because when your team very move

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,160
wears multiple heads meaning

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,800
your team actually has the wall process

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,160
under itself they can actually innovate

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,760
from inside

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,760
because we i believe we all hate when

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,440
somebody else comes in from other team

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
or from from management from the top

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,920
and says hey you just need to use this

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,639
technology and you just don't know why

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,120
why this is valuable for your team well

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,440
because

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
you know and you know your context your

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,079
team knows

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,320
its own context under which it operates

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,000
it's probably also seeing the things

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,880
they can improve in

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
and you need to work on this from inside

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,560
and

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,720
again uh there are times when

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
uh external factors or external people

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
can really help

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
the team understand more or make sense

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
of what's really going on

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,880
uh where where to make where to make

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
things better in the team or the process

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,600
better

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,160
but at the same time the team itself

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,040
will always be the best at innovating

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,600
from inside and innovating itself in

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
anything

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440
in tools and processes and then managing

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,760
the full lifecycle

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
in your own team means you have a lower

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
potential of impact

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,959
meaning if something goes wrong you now

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,279
have the one team

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,160
or a particular people in the team that

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,160
know what to do

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,959
second this will be a quick slide which

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,639
is

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,600
maintain things actively now

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,880
i know uh this is something that for

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
many for many people

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
is like yeah sure um that's what we do

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,880
and also in

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,240
open source tooling you can see this you

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,240
can see these like people

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
really trying to contribute to their own

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
code and seeing

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
all the issues and everything in there

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
and just you know trying to stay in

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,079
context of

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,440
what's going on why do people use their

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,560
libraries or why do people use their

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
tooling

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,000
at the same time i've seen this too many

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,639
times in small teams

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
where they get past their capacity again

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,920
and

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
they just abandon things in process

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
meaning

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,560
you now have features that people use uh

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,480
which is the better version

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,320
if people use your your features then

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
it's a better version of that

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,000
but at the same time you risk that

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,600
nobody will be in the context

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
if something goes wrong so you're just

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
like oh this is fine uh

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,720
you know everything's on fire but we

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,760
don't know how to fix this

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,519
and some people use that so whatever and

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,000
now it will take much more time to

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,199
actually fix that

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,279
instead uh i suggest you

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,639
have or we we try to have the

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,440
conversations of

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,079
do we actually need these things is it

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
actually

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,360
is they should like do we need these

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,480
things in the future are

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
actually people using them before we try

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,959
to abandon them

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,199
because sometimes it's just a wrong

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,560
wrong assumption that people are using

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,839
all these things or you are using all

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,720
these things while they can be very

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,639
easily replaced by something else

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,480
and as i said uh things we don't pay

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,320
attention to just backfire

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
so make sure that when you look at your

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,120
project that you don't see abandoned

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
parts

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,279
because they tend to backfire first

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
three

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,279
learn valuable things or learn valuable

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,240
knowledge

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,639
so many times i've seen people talk

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
about

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,240
or i heard people talk about the

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,959
learning curve and

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
maybe you've heard that many times too

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,040
people talking about hey

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,959
this thing has such a steep learning

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,560
curve we just don't want to practice it

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,480
we just don't want to try it even

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,079
because the technology is not for us

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,839
because we don't we right now don't have

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,519
a year to learn something

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,040
while they'll totally ignore the value

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,720
curve or

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,240
how much value the technology actually

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
has for them in time

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,560
because

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,800
there are technologies uh that actually

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,279
have a very steep curves

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,040
and you will need you will need a lot of

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,399
time to learn them

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,519
uh at the same time they will be

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,920
of a a very large value uh

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,600
in a long shot so you should still focus

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
on doing that and whenever you try to

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,040
prioritize

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
things uh in your team try to look at

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,240
the value curve

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,480
first and the value curve actually

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,720
consists of the learning curve as well

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,959
because it takes the value that it gives

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,160
you in the long term

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,399
and the background of your team

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,079
meaning how fast can you actually learn

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,360
this stuff because if you can learn this

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,959
stuff if you don't have the background

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
in your team to learn this stuff

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,160
then it won't be of much of a value

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,279
either but if you

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,600
can learn this fast and it has a value

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
in

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,440
in the long term then you're good to go

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,120
with technology

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
and one more thing theory and practice

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,720
are the same in theory

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,920
but in practice they are very different

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,279
basically meaning

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,959
uh before you before you uh

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,800
before you take the technology or

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,399
anything and say hey we just want to use

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
this because it's cool because it has

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,440
many stars on it

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,639
i just hope nobody does that anymore

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
here uh

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,680
picking technology based on that on how

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,320
many stars it has on github

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,079
but try the technology practice it

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
because that's the only thing

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,440
you can do to make sure that your team

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,000
and you will understand the technology

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,800
and the last thing fight and discover

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,839
and this is very

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,760
i'd say very controversial uh just

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,720
because every every time i see people

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,439
talking about

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,880
robustness they talk about stability but

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,000
i would say that stability

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,039
was always a ticking time bomb why is

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,160
that

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,439
well that's because people that are in a

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,319
stable environment

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,480
tend to not care that much about you

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,959
know these instabilities in the system

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,039
and so they are not prepared for what's

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,880
going on or what can go wrong

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,080
while the people that are battling every

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,640
day and trying to challenge

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,520
and baptize their systems every day they

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
are prepared

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,559
for the things that will happen in the

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,600
system

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,320
and even if there are like big issues uh

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,240
there's a

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,600
much higher chance that you will

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
actually

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,320
tackle that issue when when actually

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,320
trying to battle all the issues

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,000
all along instead of you know trying to

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,559
make the system as much stable as you

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
can

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,679
and i'm not trying to say i'm not trying

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,120
to say that you should make your system

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,640
unstable in any way

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,200
i'm trying to say battle test your

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,440
system with early adapters you know

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,720
trying to make sure that the system is

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,799
prepared

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
for whatever can can actually come

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
so with that um i just want to end with

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
this

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,880
with simple quote uh be prepared for war

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,600
by fighting small battles

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,280
uh it's for for the previous slide uh

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,120
always challenge yourself always

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,600
challenging technologies you use

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,559
and challenge the people and your

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
product

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,039
as a wall to make sure

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,720
it doesn't have all these dynamic

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,799
fragilities in the in it

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,440
and it comes many times from just people

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,640
so that's it from me if you have any

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,440
questions

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,480
i'll be happy to answer them or after

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,600
this session i will

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:55,280
all be also on the discord server so we

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,280
