	Presentation name: Finding vulnerabilities using VMaaS
Speaker: Jan Dobe≈°
Description:  Looking for a simple way how to find vulnerable packages installed on your RHEL/Fedora systems? Vulnerability Metadata as a Service (VMaaS) is an API microservice that could fulfill this need.

VMaaS works as an repository and CVE metadata aggregator and provides these metadata in a stateless HTTP API. The microservice is deployable as an docker-compose or into an OpenShift environment. There is also a public deployment hosted by Red Hat.

This talk will summarize current state of the service and present a thin client tool to obtain vulnerabilities from the API.
