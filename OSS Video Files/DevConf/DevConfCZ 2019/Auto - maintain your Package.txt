	Presentation name: Auto - maintain your Package
Speakers: Tomas Tomecek, Stef Walter
Description:  Fedora has a specific aim, to have patches and development go upstream to their respective projects. This has been on each maintainer to do. We want to make that simple, even trivial … by using Git as God^H^H^HLinus intended.

There are many packages which use source git for development, rather than dist-git: systemd, cockpit, ostree, the RHEL kernel and more. The spec files live in the project’s source git history, often pushed upstream. 

We are now working on a system to make this easily available to everyone: work with code, not tarballs and patches. We’ll show you a prototype that can easily turn on auto-maintenance of your package in dist-git, even rawhide. Have your package track upstream work automatically, when it passes tests to check that it works with the rest of Fedora.
