Title: Building Distributed Systems in Distributed Teams
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: Building Distributed Systems in Distributed Teams
Speaker: Philipp Krenn
Description:  Building distributed systems is notoriously hard... building a distributed team, even more so. At Elastic — the company behind the open source tools Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash — everything is distributed; the company and our products. This talk dives into the details of how Elastic is thriving on its distributed model:

* How Elastic started to be distributed by design.
* What our shared values are and what we have learned as we progressed and grew to our current size.
* What the day of an Elastician can look like.
* What we are using in terms of tooling.
* How we hire and onboard new employees.

hi everyone

00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:12,420
everybody's still awake more or less

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,439
let's see okay so who is working from

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,910
home here that's more than usual but

00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:19,710
that was kind of odd obviously expecting

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,359
who's working from a co-working space or

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,089
like a shared office or something like

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,609
that and who is working from an office

00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:31,019
okay it's still the majority yeah and do

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,850
you have something like this like this

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,440
maybe need somebody saw that this muscle

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,070
so you can do the private cause in your

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,810
office or maybe what was also pretty

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,030
famous awhile ago were these like

00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,320
horse-like glasses that you wouldn't see

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,780
your co-workers and you also wouldn't

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,620
hear anything to actually work properly

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,360
in an open fourth floor office and who

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,780
is this like you work from home for one

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,240
day a week preferably Friday okay if you

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,920
is it the slacking off day where

00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,650
everybody knows you will take it easy

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,939
you do the laundry you do whatever you

00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,740
want yeah kind of for some because I

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,780
find it super weird I generally work

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,340
from home and for me like working from

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,440
home is not the slacking off day it's

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,600
not checking off the every day or in

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,580
general working from home feels more

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,979
productive than going to the office but

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,900
maybe I'm wrong in that but I'll try to

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,750
convince you let's see so I work for

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,580
elastic the company behind some

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,400
open-source products which I have on the

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,810
next slide I mainly travel and talk

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,130
about the stuff that we do and try to

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,049
answer questions so if you have any

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,570
about our products just come to me

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,229
afterwards yeah so we do a lastik search

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,340
and some other open-source products we

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,510
are kind of large by now we are around

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,340
1200 or so but it changed every week

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,890
it's very hard to keep track up so maybe

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,260
these numbers already a bit outdated and

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,720
just to give you an idea like this was

00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,790
last week this is just the new highest

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,470
to see how many people join and you can

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,299
see that some days on one day you have

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,159
multiple people joining is just like

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,220
pretty much chaos and then everybody

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,530
responds like 20 or 30 people respond to

00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,479
every newly hired so if you don't filter

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,640
your emails properly you have no idea

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,460
what is going on anymore

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,959
by the way I said illustrations in the

00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,440
first slide we actually had a vote on

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,700
that so at some point our CEO kind of

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,650
figured out we don't have a proper name

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,950
and we had like a boat of how we should

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,110
call ourselves the first idea or it was

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,220
not the first idea but somebody came up

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,260
with this to have the elastic comrades

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,580
which yeah depending on where you are in

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,400
the world it might be more funny than

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,080
elsewhere some of us were more like the

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,660
Mickey Mouse and like the Mickey Mouse

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,360
ears the last 50 years where we have our

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,400
logo in the years as well and what we

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,170
genuinely do is like everybody throws in

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,910
various ideas and then we just the boat

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,310
these were all the ideas that we came up

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,320
with for Italy all the ones I collected

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,360
my personal preference would be have

00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,850
been homo elastic hose but unfortunately

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,300
that wasn't it the one that we decided

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,769
so we immediately voted and we went with

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,860
Anastasia switch it's not the most

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,540
creative one but whatever I think these

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,220
numbers where I'm not sure I made it

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,630
plus the only number where I'm pretty

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,090
sure is the number of offices that we

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,120
have but countries languages and time

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,360
zones this is approximately what I think

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,430
is correct or what we gathered as a team

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,190
what make sense and having 19 time zones

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,799
is already pretty painful because it's

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,690
always night for somebody or weekend or

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,000
in Israel they don't work on Friday but

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,310
they work on Sundays and it's very hard

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,989
to keep everybody aligned and like

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,030
figure out who is available when and

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,400
what works we do have some offices but

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,989
those are mostly marketing and sales for

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,600
engineering it's really wherever you are

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,430
generally from home maybe if we have an

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,170
office in your city you can come to the

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,820
office but a lot of people don't for

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,340
example I think in Berlin we have a

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,230
small engineering office and out of the

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,180
20 or so people that we have in Berlin I

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,160
think four are going to the office in

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,920
general and some of them are only going

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,910
to or three days a week but that's not

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,260
going to find everybody can work

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:09,890
wherever they think they can work best

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,840
how do we get started by that um so

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,030
these four guys those are the founders

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,709
of the company when even they were

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,570
distributed so they were not in the same

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,410
city and that's always why we say this

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,320
is kind of like a

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,330
DNA that we didn't start with one office

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,870
and then adding more remote people over

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,460
time it's really that even they were

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,830
just spread out like back then it was

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,480
only am saddam and berlin but even they

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,190
were not in one place so everything was

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,140
in writing and everything was in calls

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,120
and it was not like oh let's go for a

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,340
coffee to make a decision but it was a

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,290
bit more structured way and we kept that

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,090
as a company and that allowed us to kind

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,570
of like grow this distributed team so

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,040
easily we do not like the term remote to

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,780
be honest because remote for us always

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,520
means you have one central hub where a

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,470
few hops and then you have remote people

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
around that and we don't think that

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,620
works really well or I know from some of

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,750
other companies like in Silicon Valley

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,090
they have their headquarter and they

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,290
have like 70% or 60% of the people

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,300
working there and the rest are

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,800
distributed and for them it's often very

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,470
hard to be part of the decision-making

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,540
process because people just talk over

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,340
coffee and make a decision like it's not

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,870
even planned but it just happens when

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,730
you talk to your colleagues in person

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,070
whereas since we are really spread out

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,380
there is no oh let's talk this over over

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,510
coffee but it's always a call or always

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,640
an email or a github issue or however we

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,350
come to a conclusion to something and I

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,260
think this is a major advantage that

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,080
it's so broken up that you cannot really

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,060
make that in-person quick decision by

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,180
cutting off lots of other people that's

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,680
just not possible basically we do have

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,000
something we call X school which is

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,950
basically an onboarding week so

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,930
everybody who gets hired will go to

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,630
marketing where we have our biggest

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,220
office and this is one group we run one

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,500
of these X codes I think every two

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,250
months now so this is two months of

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,990
newly hired people joining and then just

00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,910
figuring out how does the company works

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,140
and who is where and what are even the

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,240
positions and what is everybody doing

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,950
and how do we work together as a team so

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,050
it's not for your specific technical

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,730
function it's more just like how does a

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,620
distributed company work or how does the

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,660
company work in general and bit more

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,850
about the values and how we work

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,700
together and we have something called

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,320
always-on which is basically every team

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,120
has a video channel and everybody can

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,770
just hop on that video channel and for

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,700
example the first day I joined somebody

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,470
said like oh come on

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,750
Aon and it's basically everybody is

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,060
muted and streaming themselves working

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,919
and you don't feel that lonely sitting

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,660
at home you can just see your colleagues

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,490
working

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,040
don't fit your nose or do other stuff

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,630
while you're on video but otherwise it's

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,190
very nice also if you have a problem and

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,440
need to help from somebody you just undo

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,300
it and then say hey boss or whoever you

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,100
need and can you help me out with this

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,840
and then somebody else might see that

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,010
and might jump in and say like oh I know

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,990
what you're talking about

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,970
and once you're done you can mute

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,710
yourself some people really like Aon

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,360
others don't like it so much because

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,950
it's too much activity for them but it's

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,140
at least an option to have your

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,990
colleagues a bit closer by and see that

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,790
everybody is working we do have a lot of

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,010
pristine time as well so for example

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,330
support has a call with the engineers

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,130
every week and says like these were the

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,560
worst support places we had this week

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,200
and this is causing us continued trouble

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,150
we probably need to fix this or we have

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,120
fix it Friday where we go through the

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,680
open issues or some pull requests to

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,270
just cut down on the number of issues

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
and open for requests overtime because

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,740
otherwise they grow without bound and

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,540
it's just the entire team or whoever is

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,160
on line gets together and works on

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,320
issues and pull requests to cut down the

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,850
number some teams have office hours

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,410
where you can just pop in and say like

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,120
hey I have a question I want to talk to

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,710
you or I have this idea let's talk

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,170
something through so people are

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,790
available it's not a requirement to be

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,280
in the same office to actually have

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,870
these we don't have release parties

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,070
which might look something like this so

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,310
for example you can see this is the

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,560
product need for cabaña or well not the

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,530
product it for Cabana and however I must

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,570
admit that the part is at home I'm not

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,720
as good as in the office or it's maybe a

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:05,210
bit different because you see you get

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,500
you get some some bottle of whatever and

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,970
then you start drinking it and then you

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,130
see the other offices at the other

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,510
people on video and for five or ten

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,120
minutes that's fun but afterwards

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,680
everybody goes back to work but maybe

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,690
this is more of a future than a back I

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,300
don't know but and the office part is

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,130
sitting at home I kind of alone the

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,120
office parties are hard to compete with

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:28,760
I will admit that people often asked

00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,880
like what do you have like scrum do you

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,930
have daily stand-ups what do you do

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,490
admittedly we are not very strong on

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,650
that it's pretty much every team figures

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,539
out what works for them and we don't

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,310
have a company-wide approach or anything

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,800
also because something

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,560
stand up in the morning if you have ten

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,330
time zones in a team when would morning

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,980
be for everybody it's like you don't

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,120
even get everybody on the same call so

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,340
stand up is kind of like a different

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,800
concept for us at least in engineering

00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,320
it's pretty much pull requests are the

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,910
currency or the baseline what works for

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,470
everybody so if somebody starts working

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,420
on something you open the pull request

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,490
maybe just for feedback or for the cut

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,470
final code review and then depending on

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,790
a team one two or three people will

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,310
review that and then you start to

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,380
discussion based on that and that's the

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,510
main process some teams have liked to

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,520
cause a week others have only a call

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,900
every two weeks really depends on the

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,930
team what you think what makes most

00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,940
sense for you as a team

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,529
we do need twice a year in general so we

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,300
have engineering or hand or all the

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,640
engineers get together in fall normally

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,910
we do those in Europe like we were in

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,770
Dublin and then we were in Prague and in

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,930
Barcelona and Berlin like those were the

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,730
roster this we didn't fully parlament

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:43,010
and in spring we normally go to the u.s.

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,420
sometimes we say insist to in their own

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,060
event because you know sales and

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,480
engineering it's just different worlds

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,820
let's say like that sometimes like this

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,120
may we'll have a company All Hands where

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,370
we will get 1,200 or however many people

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,400
we are will get everybody in one place

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,670
and then figure out what we'll do in the

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,560
future probably not support because we

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,960
figured out support is very hard to get

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,580
to the same event because basically what

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,620
you need since support me to keep going

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,230
what we would need to do is you flying

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,910
in some support people early they start

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,190
taking over while the other support

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,390
people fly in and then you need to do

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,180
support in the middle of the night

00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,920
because well in Europe it's hey but in

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,480
the u.s. it's the night and somebody we

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,370
need to do support and that is

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,260
especially tricky if you get the entire

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,850
company together since we don't see each

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,620
other that much and there's a lot of

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,360
partying then and then somebody will do

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,300
support at 3:00 a.m. in the morning and

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,520
then all the people who just came back

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,790
from partying will stone the support

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,410
room and cause have up there like

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,089
normally we have these into Afghanistan

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,740
stuff like that and then somebody's

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,250
trying to do the support case and is

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,500
getting shot in the head with an

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,720
Afghan at the same time so that's very

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,030
tough for support so support they often

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,470
do their own support thing and then the

00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,830
engineers will take over support for a

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,900
week

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,830
everybody from home and it's easier for

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:07,080
everybody to do that we don't have some

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,770
values I'll just pick out six values

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,930
from the tech side and three from the

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,950
people side but we have that as a public

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,270
document and it's actually pretty

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,940
interesting it that drives a lot of the

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,460
engineering decisions that we do for

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,620
example progress of a perfection like we

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,950
had the problems in the past where we we

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,600
had some caching layer we implemented

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,610
that and technically this was really

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,470
good but then the discussion or the bike

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,020
sharing started of like when should the

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,150
caching kick in like how many calls

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,680
should be needed until we start caching

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,080
something and then some people said like

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,090
ten and somebody else said a thousand

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,590
and at some point you just need to make

00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,570
a decision and it might be wrong and you

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,580
know I might need to reevaluate the

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,590
decision later on but at some point you

00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,420
just need to make some call and rather

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,550
than stall and keep discussing forever

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,470
we would have progress of a perfection

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,690
it might not be the perfect solution in

00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,450
the end but it's at least some place to

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,650
get going

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,240
let's blog probably the classic that

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,520
everybody is trying to do but it's very

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,250
hard to achieve to leave out needless

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,600
abstractions and design for today but we

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,580
always say like okay do we have a

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,250
specific use case do we solve an actual

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,870
problem or is it just like some ivory

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,760
tower that we're trying to build here

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:22,020
obviously everybody's trying that but

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,030
yeah we're trying as well if possible

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,160
and we don't know if feature will really

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,050
work out well in the future we try to

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,820
build it in isolation probably only have

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,770
it as a plugin because something is

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,500
merged into master it's probably there

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,540
forever maybe not forever but probably

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,550
very long term and it's very hard to get

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,760
something out again so if possibly build

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,860
something in isolation this one is not

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,900
very popular for upgrades because

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,460
sometimes to figure out especially when

00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,290
support says hey this is broken and this

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,970
is just not working correctly we might

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,460
remove a feature without having a

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,380
replacement which we know is not great

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,950
for the upgrade experience but sometimes

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,470
we just want to avoid the issues and not

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,460
keep suffering through it and we might

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,170
reintroduce the issue late

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,610
but in the meantime it might just be

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,090
done we had that for example we had dots

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,470
and feed names we remove that then we

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,960
brought them back but with a totally

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,760
different reimplementation but to avoid

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,410
the problems around those we just had to

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,150
remove the future first people were not

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,860
happy but we think it's the right way

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,550
forward sometimes you need to break

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,260
stuff to make progress yeah will only

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,510
accept stuff that's case if you have a

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,090
nice solution that works for like 10

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,530
gigabytes of data but will totally fail

00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,840
over 500 gigabytes

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,760
we will not merge it we had some very

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,830
nice pull requests which had exactly the

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:44,050
issue and they never made it into the

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:46,900
product yeah first if you have to pick a

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,080
default the default will be fast and you

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,030
can probably tune it for more accuracy

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,040
so slow is option of the optional like

00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,320
we would rather lean towards this fast

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,080
use case because we assume that's what

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,640
you want in most cases but maybe you can

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,020
tune something to be slower and that

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,990
makes it kind of optional yeah on the

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,190
people side it's like be kind which is

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,630
kind of obvious especially if you don't

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,370
see each other that frequently it's very

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,170
hard to get the wrong impression of

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,390
somebody and always just assume the best

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,910
also if somebody is arguing very

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,590
passionately for something assume that

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,840
it's because they are so invested in the

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,480
product and everybody who is like

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,100
passionately it's like because they want

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,510
to make the right thing and want to make

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,280
progress it's not because they want to

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,170
fight but because they genuinely want

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,590
the best and you should always assume

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,200
that when positions get heated what we

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,210
don't tolerate is any abusive behavior

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,990
we had some very good engineers who had

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,440
to leave the company unfortunately

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,600
because stuff just didn't work out but

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,520
it's sometimes better to make like the

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,780
hard cut at one end and five other

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,080
people leaving the company because

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,510
somebody keeps being abusive never a

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,690
nice cold luckily I don't have to make

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,360
those but we had issues like that my

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,700
personal experience the first thing is

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,220
that when your trusted like I was made

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,890
an admin of the github organization the

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,890
day I joined which was a bit scary and

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,650
somebody once deleted a major repository

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,210
from github

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:19,100
accidentally because they thought it was

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:21,440
their own clone not everybody has happen

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,420
rights anymore I gave up mine as well by

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,180
the way keep up can restore those so if

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,000
anybody deletes a repository those can

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,080
be restored pack it up again as well

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,540
generally what my manager always tells

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,250
me or my team lead is do the right thing

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,950
like just figure out what makes sense

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,560
for the company and for you and then do

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,600
that I'm not going to tell you what to

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,890
do just do the right thing which is not

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,540
making it easier it immediately

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,430
especially if you don't really know

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,740
where you're going just telling somebody

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,050
do the right thing it's sometimes a bit

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,210
tricky but in the long run it also gives

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,210
you a lot of power to kind of figure out

00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,910
what is the right thing oftentimes

00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,680
people volunteer to do stuff um

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,130
sometimes you're being able on told so

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,410
for example sometimes there is like some

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:08,840
necessary but very annoying refactoring

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,880
for example to do stuff and if nobody

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,760
wants to step up to do that somebody has

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,260
to be talked into it let's say like hey

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,150
you're gonna do this thing for three

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,210
months but you will get to do something

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,950
more fun afterwards so it's always a bit

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,500
of haggling and getting people to do

00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,240
that and we try to keep communication

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,190
open and public which can mean pretty

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,350
much this is the so-called deaf calendar

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,060
these are all the events that we have on

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,130
that so you could do calls all day long

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,780
if that is a good investment of your

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,640
time is a different story though and I

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,490
try to stay away from as many calls as

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,730
possible and you can see this European

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,260
Times since we have most of the games in

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,000
years in Europe and the US it's very

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,360
much afternoon heavy so you could do the

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,800
entire afternoon of course and new

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,900
products join the family like that's

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,060
also how we grow but also how lots of

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,840
other companies grow like you try to

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,690
find innovative creative good products

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,550
to join a family in which everybody

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,590
however today distributed nature of

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,830
teamsters they are definitely dying down

00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,690
sites one of them are time zones are a

00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,430
pain like I have a call that is

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,710
alternating between 6 a.m. in the

00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,320
morning and 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. is really

00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,760
not my time but sometimes you have to

00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,170
suffer so they're not always the same

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,730
people have to suffer like initially we

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,500
often had it that since we had fewer

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,760
people in Asia they would always get the

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,100
crappy calls like it

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,810
three or four a.m. their time so but

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,640
it's really not fair in the long run to

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,520
always make the same people suffering so

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,140
good as a team so we try to share the

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,460
pain of times also the joy of time zones

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,190
communication can fail you have to admit

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,500
that our lesson is pretty much like if

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,350
stuff gets heated jump on the video call

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,350
to figure it out quickly and cultures

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,940
are just different what might be funny

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,910
in Europe might be totally inappropriate

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,340
in the US so you should kind of figure

00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,840
out what works for everybody also

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,670
sometimes it would be nice to lock

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,200
everybody in the same room and say like

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,940
you stay here until you come to a

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,590
conclusion with all the different time

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,270
zones and then people having to pick up

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,730
their kids at different times sometimes

00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,170
decisions just drag because after one

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,460
hour of a call you haven't made a

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,410
decision but somebody has to pick up

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,840
their kids you cannot tell them well

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,730
leave your kids at the school like and

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,740
then the discussion position gets

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,360
postponed another week so stuff can

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,370
sometimes drag abit it's just the

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,010
downside people often ask about tools

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,010
that's not super surprising we use slack

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,300
even with a new logo and soon for the

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,700
video course because it's the only thing

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,480
that we found to really scale like to

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,650
500 people in one color so for

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,740
asynchronous communication get up and

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:46,550
lots of emails my main thing for emails

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,880
is lots of filters this and many many

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:52,070
more otherwise you just run an image we

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,780
do have team tech and product leads

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,170
together we don't have a dedicated

00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:59,660
product team they're part of engineering

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,730
now for example Corp it's the

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,520
lightweight cheapest that we have team

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,680
tech and product lead and they are kind

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,240
of working together to figure out where

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,600
the product is heading who needs to be

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
hired

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,650
what tech decisions are being made and

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,510
they will work that out what we found

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,370
very helpful is to have an overall stack

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,080
lead since we have so many products it's

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,090
nice when everybody pushes in their own

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,650
direction but sometimes you need to kind

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,970
of get anybody on the same picture and

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,290
have to create a vision and make

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:30,230
everybody push in one direction together

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,610
hiring can be interesting for us what is

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,200
very important it's not so much you

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,490
don't like to turn soft skills we would

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,350
rather call it professional skill

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,220
especially if you're in this tributed

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,750
team communication is very important

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,970
if you cannot properly communicate with

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,860
your colleagues it's very hard if you're

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,220
sitting at home alone somewhere because

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,080
it's not going to work out any long run

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,970
we don't like these like we don't really

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,450
care about your age or your background

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,580
or anything we do get a lot of CDs like

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,760
HR told me they called got thirty

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,370
thousand CDs in the last quarter and we

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,970
try to improve or you get even more to

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,980
find more suitable candidates yeah like

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,990
everybody else we don't do like how many

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,960
golf balls fit into a jumbo jet or

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:16,049
something like that because we wouldn't

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,120
know either growth has been pretty fast

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,590
that you can see it took us from going

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,380
from five to six-hundred it took us five

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,150
months but since being 700 we have

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,700
pretty consistently hired 50 people

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,919
every month and so it always takes us

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,659
two months to add a hundred people and

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,789
we don't have any intentions of stopping

00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,700
I think so will be another 50 every

00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:38,010
month in the future and now people are

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,809
saying okay show us the perfect numbers

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,760
why is working from home or in the

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,919
distributed team so much better than

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,360
working from an office unfortunately I

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,450
don't have those perfect numbers and

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,950
like Bill better always says or but

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,870
often says it best like you could make

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,039
those up and then everybody would

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,850
believe it

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,679
so I didn't make up any such numbers

00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,390
what I do have um this is from some

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,700
quarters back this is like how many

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,850
people joined in one quarter and how

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,110
many people left and for us it's not a

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,150
perfect number but this is a good

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:12,960
indicator as long as the ratio of join

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:15,390
us in contrast to leavers is that high

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,070
we feel like we're on the right path to

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,600
that so to wrap up somebody was once

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,429
nice enough to draw all of this I'll

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,470
post the slides afterwards you can have

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:29,010
the conclusion in there but this is what

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:31,740
we've pretty much discussed we've

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,030
invented being fully distributed so even

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,659
that is not stopping you as a company

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:40,620
and finally who still wants to work from

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:44,669
an office I know if you raise their

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,530
hands once welcome home okay for me

00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,450
personally I would have a very hard time

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,380
going back to an office I must admit I'm

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,650
having a hard time

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:57,090
right now but maybe it might be possible

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,290
I'm not sure obviously we are hiring but

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,630
everybody is hiring so when you knew

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:05,260
that any questions and I think we have

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:08,670
three minutes left for questions I'll

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,670
try to repeat if anybody has questions

00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:17,340
did anybody work from home and wanted to

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:27,130
return to an office I would be curious

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:37,600
okay that's three okay to see people

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:40,770
okay okay to see people we're always

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,690
curious how how it works out for others

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:46,090
for me like when I go to some company

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,860
and see their open floor office and see

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,390
like everybody walking around and

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,720
everybody chatting I'm like how is

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,850
anybody getting anything done here but

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,430
maybe maybe I turned into the office

00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:01,810
Grinch by now and just want to sit by

00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:03,160
myself in the corner no questions okay

00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,630
and if you want to have some stickers

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,790
from us I have a couple of stickers over

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,110
there grab them otherwise if you have

00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,520
any more questions just come to me

00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,520
afterwards thanks so much

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,530
