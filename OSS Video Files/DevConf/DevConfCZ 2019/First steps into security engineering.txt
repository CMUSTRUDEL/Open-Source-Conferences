Description: 
	Presentation name: First steps into security engineering
Speaker: Christian Heimes
Description:  Experience with security is a useful and even profitable skill for every technical and non-technical employee in IT. Contrary to common stereotypes, security is far more than black hoodies, math and crypto. It's also humans and communication skills.

Attendees of my talk DevConf.CZ 2018 talk and DevConf.IN key note have ask me how to get started. Let me introduce you to diverse areas of info sec and point you to books, online courses, talks, and other resources to get you started.

hello morning or good afternoon I do so

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,210
sorry I'm a bit sick I running a course

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,160
happily I will be able to tell you till

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,810
the end so hi I'm Christian I'm now

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,900
going to talk to you and explain to you

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,509
my personal private views how to start

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,150
as a security engineer so the talks

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:30,419
started actually last year with DEFCON

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,910
India that's the personal opening up the

00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:34,980
firewall exit last year have given me

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,780
keynote about security and community and

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,820
responsibilities and people asked me

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,300
actually but to start a security

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,310
engineer so a general gulps what you're

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,520
going to learn here and first on with

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,530
this primer this is a very opinionated

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,170
opinionated and subjective talk it's

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,970
just my personal ideas which maybe you

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,550
find it useful or not it's also

00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,490
incomplete probably biased because I'm a

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,190
rock back end engineer and it's not that

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:06,780
serious it's bit of entertainment to so

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,520
I hope to you entertain you a bit so

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,280
chapter one is going to be thinking and

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,300
took the choose gonna be learning so how

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,180
to think of security engineer and how to

00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,800
what a thing is useful to learn and one

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,979
thing is to learner that's you in here

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,970
I'm not always be people that are black

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,610
by Mouse because it's fun feedback I was

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:34,610
just kind of India well either we break

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:38,280
stuff or we break stuff whatever so and

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,380
a quick recap from presentation I gave

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,200
last year's Def Con why should we care

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,450
about security just very very quick so

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,190
it's for one about money you can use

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,190
lots of money if you don't care about

00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,320
security or you can actually kill people

00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,540
or if you have like they want and

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,400
replacing a pacemaker is not an easy

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,890
thing you have to cut people open to fix

00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,970
the security bug and nobody wants to get

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,920
cut open so next up with some statements

00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,409
and propositions just to get you

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,610
feedback from the audience you think

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,049
about that so

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,140
Security's actually a feature or

00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:17,050
something you can saw your customers too

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,080
and as an attacking it you only need

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,270
just one vulnerability but as a defender

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,620
summary like us writing software you

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:28,510
must be always perfect always and

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,760
finally most users just don't care that

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,140
much of a security and just often they

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,110
just insult like Marga on their own

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,230
computer to use stupid passwords and

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,530
mostly users to blame so what do you

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,110
think feedback so we think that's a

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:49,410
valid proposition third statement or

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:53,440
think that's ends up the thing it's good

00:02:49,410 --> 00:03:01,690
okay just a few hands well okay I think

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:03,519
it spoiled it a bit used to think like

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,190
that blame the users we are the

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,730
engineers we are perfect and user now

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,450
you please close the door

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,070
thank you I think it's very dangerous

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,480
party also arrogant to think like that

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:21,489
and I'll explain you later why because

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,890
we engineers we software developers

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,959
actually do stuff for users so if you

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,000
know the old movie Tron we fight for the

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,940
users we don't fight like for ourselves

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,430
we want to build something to solve the

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,310
people to be useful especially its

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,160
open-source engineers so chapter 0

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,160
actually attitude so how you should

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,810
actually think about security and the

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,980
first thing is security it's not a

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:50,140
feature not like by itself because would

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,390
you buy a car that's like advertised

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,900
like that

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,260
[Laughter]

00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,230
do you just assume that a car just

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:05,330
doesn't explode by itself and nobody

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:09,709
would actually advertise cars - yeah so

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:12,739
and civil engineers automobile engineers

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,180
or they all run that the hard way there

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:19,100
were multiple accidents in the past

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:21,889
that's a bridge in Scotland 150 years 20

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,620
years ago see my speaker slides a secret

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,120
again so they learnt the hard way that

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,979
you should not build bridges in a way

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,680
that they just collapse and the

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:35,630
Aeronautics industry also does lots of

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,610
testing so that picture had last year

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:42,500
how they actually engineer and test

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,270
airplanes so that's a wing up test you

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,030
see that's a tip of the wings so they do

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,460
very thorough testing because if you

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,350
have an airplane there is no safe mode

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,030
as soon as it's in the air so you have

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,800
to get the thing down in one piece

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,270
somehow and if that fails well yeah it

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,500
comes down but you won't have one piece

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,270
and it's also security also not this I

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,740
was looking for a work that explained

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,630
black or white because using work

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,360
plugins wide lets you only what I could

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,370
find so it means it's not just either

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,760
totally secure or totally insecure there

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,680
are multiple shades between that Alex

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,990
gamer abroad a very good blog post about

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,510
that the worst prison information

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,169
security that you must be perfect always

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,229
in most case it's not that it can have

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:33,110
like slightly insecure software with you

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:37,729
do it the right way and how do they like

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:41,060
to exploding cars hmm yeah so maybe you

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,919
you need sometimes a car that does not

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,840
expose you to that bad maybe in other

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,919
cases you want to have like a cheap car

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,440
that runs on standards like roads and

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,050
that's something you have to figure out

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,630
who is your advert adversary's your

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,539
enemy who tries to attack you and how

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,330
much can you actual apps and also

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,550
there's no thing as unbreakable

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,240
encryption or absolute security if

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,610
somebody ask

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,699
yeah word something on break ball how

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,350
about like a Kardashev level three alien

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,449
civilization that can harness the energy

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,949
of the whole universe to power a

00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,530
supercomputer can they break your

00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,750
encryption well if you can prove that

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,120
even an alien civilization could not do

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:28,289
that maybe then your unbreakable but

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,110
maybe not yeah so you have to think

00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:33,000
about threat modeling you have to wait

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,789
costs the benefits and you have to

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,220
actually document what could go wrong

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:40,229
one point that people are always I think

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,930
a good example that is fingerprint

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:44,669
sensor on your mobile phone for most

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,220
people is actually beneficial to use a

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,919
fingerprint sensor because it's very

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,660
easy to a lock and unlock your phone

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,880
except if you have like state sponsors

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,530
attack us I want to steal like your data

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,240
if you're like a journalist then it's

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,759
maybe not the best way but for most

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:05,490
people although it can be broken more

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,110
less easily yeah or cost benefits some

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,680
of it's fun to think about like quantum

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:14,310
computer TLS ciphers in most cases it's

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,470
actually don't use vegetable names yeah

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,030
go for the low hanging fruits say people

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:26,849
the past had that so you want to have

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:28,590
like defense-in-depth or like aircrafts

00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:32,490
do that also they are like not cool too

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,199
it's it's a wing from the airplane just

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,719
they have multiple ways to actually

00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,430
control the thing that's not going to

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,789
into because already just like 1/2

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,490
minutes in beginning to explain that but

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:45,750
even if both engines the sort of

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,990
priority right here and the batteries

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,360
failed and that control all these flats

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,330
and spoilers or whatever they have on

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,969
the wings this Oh still one more backup

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,630
mechanism for airplanes and but I'll

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:02,159
figure that out a bit more safe to fly

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,699
they can do something like that they can

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,650
just bet a rat that the ram air turbine

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,900
so even if everything fails they can

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,860
still power the whole engine

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:17,339
the evil hydraulics in control the plane

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,380
so if you develop software like that

00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,060
even if

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,750
everything goes brung me up like a back

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:27,950
up pretty good and that makes the our

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,780
industry or a very safe place I still

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,120
have the spike from 2017 because pretty

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,300
eighty was never not that good and also

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,360
it took 17 we had like that one where

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:43,039
Emma Xun brought one engineer brought in

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:46,280
a large part of Internet down and we

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,320
didn't have any bet large outtakes this

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,920
year's frozen last year it was in there

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:56,120
and so last month please mind the user

00:08:51,920 --> 00:09:01,070
and if you're from London you may know

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:03,650
that one so please take care of users

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,870
because if you still think that users of

00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:10,280
the blame for security incidents it's

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:12,530
the wrong way this take care and think

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,840
and there are lots of wait he means can

00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,570
do stupid things but again repeat from

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:22,220
last year social engineering is a big

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,470
issue where like you have attacks that

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,480
try to do it like it's called spear

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,270
phishing we get information of the CEO

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,220
and shake other people to send you money

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:35,570
about people like to give away chocolate

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,930
and get passwords etc etc etc and so you

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,730
have to ask yourself not what users can

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,580
do the security but what security

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,030
engineers can do for users to make users

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:51,710
more safe especially people like that

00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:59,450
your grandmother so what's your first

00:09:51,710 --> 00:10:00,650
reaction you see that anybody yeah okay

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,090
yeah epic fail

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,430
it shouldn't probably scream my

00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,530
grandmother but just ask yourself why

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,930
did you rent another install flash maybe

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,790
she wanted to but you know usually

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,950
calling she made like years ago with a

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,300
old phone the only way to achieve review

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:20,090
the beauty Korea's because the baby is

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:23,060
installing flash so asked why and write

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,640
to that user interfaces left be to

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,590
accidents incidents the last two and a

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,130
half years left is Hawaii

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:33,200
well somebody make it mistake and didn't

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,090
accept user interface the I want a

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,980
couple of months ago very unfortunate

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,340
were there was an incident where an

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,320
airplane crash because user interface

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,090
did not tell the pilot something the

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,400
part could understand in an emergency

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,550
situation and basically the airplane

00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,550
tries to save itself by driving itself

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:55,089
down in the sea and people just died you

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:59,540
know nor prove everybody on board by

00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:01,850
using the face problem and the lndustry

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,250
has another way to model that kind of

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,950
security or like a lot because they are

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:10,070
usually safe it's called the Swiss

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,140
cheese model where you have multiple

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,620
layers that protect each other and only

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:18,260
when all these holds the small gaps in

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:23,480
your design come together so human error

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:32,660
technical arrow design arrows then it

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:35,210
failed so yeah so no next one how you

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:40,490
think as a security engineer more some

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:42,500
time one sentence that I picked up many

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,100
years ago from a book by Bruce Schneier

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,320
to be professional paranoid and paranoid

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,210
in close because paranoid actually is

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,240
serious mental illness not something

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,980
should make fun of but I think most

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,640
people think of security engineers that

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,490
they emphasize too much and security of

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,170
Western usability and sometimes blowout

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,880
security backs out of proportion and

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:10,870
just to remember keep professional keep

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,060
your own bits of paranoia and

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:17,330
beautifully balanced and another thing I

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,210
personally do a lot is just to want be

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,180
creative think of like funny crazy ideas

00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,010
but the other thing is often security

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,230
packs repeat themselves they've been

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,620
like lighten bhai text for us twenty

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:34,000
years attack on earth a and see if you

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,000
cover that because I missed your talk

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,820
often if you see like a 60 pockemon in

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,460
fro language so I'm on the pricing

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,800
security team and they have been places

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,839
in cases where we have packs in Ruby and

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,700
PHP and with the same Python because we

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,760
made the same mistakes sufferers often

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,990
remarkable lighten those layers and

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,550
these abstraction layers are leaky

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,279
especially if you consider security and

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,760
they might even less look like this

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:09,770
stone but more like Jenga tower I was

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,200
falling over and they leak through and

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:16,440
very good example for that I like is the

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,330
way can actually exploit behavior of

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,029
electrons in the computer from

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:24,089
JavaScript in your browser and do a row

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,190
hammer attack and that goes through so

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:29,970
many layers of indirection abstraction

00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,380
it's just mind-boggling as a attacks you

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,390
can even collect them with a microphone

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,240
they have been funny attacks using

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,450
acoustics I have that slide for a couple

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,029
of years now so that it's funny a new

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,890
one I found this really the other way he

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,100
look into security you want to what make

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:49,560
you like your data center secure its

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:55,350
against like intrude years and that's

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:59,130
not a typo today to go on Twitter just

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,779
too funny to not at that so it doesn't

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,339
help if you make the software that your

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,830
server CQ you also want to make access

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,800
to your infrastructure secure so and

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:10,410
there's so many levels and any mods have

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,370
fun that's also something I rather bring

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,800
up terrorism actually most dangerous

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,750
more than a squirrel's

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,959
this is all this website that lists

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,959
power outages of data centers and big

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:32,580
cities by animals with maps and links to

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:35,220
news reports and finally another slide I

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,400
like to bring off this it's also it used

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,310
a security engineer engineer in general

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,510
about ethics and compliance and just be

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:47,500
nice and

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:56,110
idiot so we have a responsibility to

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:57,670
keep people safe the original posting

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,870
was this company who solved that as a

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,640
t-shirt but last sentence was Sylvia

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,590
loves you and the girl replied me yeah I

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:13,180
love you too but I think that's the

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:16,780
better version of this so what should

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,970
you learn and leave how the thing to

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,490
actually admit to yourself that you

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,100
actually don't nothing so this is

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:28,110
so-called Socratic paradox I know that I

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:32,710
know nothing and must be a word that

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:35,370
computer science security programming so

00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,960
complex it's virtually impossible to

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,120
even understand one area very well you

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,400
can have like be especially in a very

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,860
narrow area or know like a bigger area a

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:49,330
bit better but actually knowing all of

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,040
it is impossible so be aware of that so

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,560
that why you need communication think

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,390
that's the most important skill both in

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,370
the sense of talking to your team

00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,210
members talking to users and a-standing

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:04,780
users but also to gather information and

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:08,140
finally it's by Google's security

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:11,440
princess Teresa turrets stop reading

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,150
start doing so you can real security but

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,300
you actually must get your hands dirty

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,570
and get practical but if you want to

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,220
start by reading and to recommend that I

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:24,340
really like that book was one of my

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:27,820
first security books and you can get

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,820
that now for free it's bit dated but

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,980
still very good explains like different

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,960
kind of security modeled by I think

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,860
household military base in the hospital

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:43,300
like a practical ideas and prickly case

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:46,630
studies ok let's get down to bit more

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,760
concrete things running through that so

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,500
I also go up lots of slides so you don't

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,209
need to write down all the links names

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,889
that will pop up next couple of

00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:58,660
minutes are just throwing spice in your

00:16:53,889 --> 00:17:02,529
face and hopefully I'll slide up in an

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:05,230
hour or so so one of the important

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,610
things is you need soft skills like as a

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,679
heating engineer but general as an

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,329
engineer you want to work in a team you

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:15,339
want to burden the team that's diverse

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:17,529
both in a social consideration of also

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,659
technical expertise you need people who

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,120
know like how hardware works you need

00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:24,250
people now see crypto works other you

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,770
know how browsers work because I don't

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,169
know like front-end development

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,460
I've almost no clue about that but we

00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:32,980
have what people are a team that now

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,230
front-end things and if I talk to them

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,700
and change exchange of years they may

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,950
come my dear and yeah it's also very

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,830
important to know how to find

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,720
information it's less about like knowing

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,330
all the things these days you can just

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,179
use that go Google or whatever to find

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,340
information but understanding concepts

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,010
and then be able to find information

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,690
about that concept and ever yet which

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,860
information is actually good which is

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,470
maybe bad information yeah

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,539
other things you have your legal affairs

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,029
if you give a security that open

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:11,980
compliance rules if you find security

00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:13,630
bugs you may actually get in trouble

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,340
reporting then depending which country

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,360
you are or which company you find a

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,640
security bug or thorax is good how to

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,480
convince people that they may have a

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,750
problem and yeah and reading and writing

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,260
documentation I think lots of Engineers

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,779
consider like top writers as like second

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,340
class whatever people watching rocky

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,110
clear documentation that easily

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,210
understandable by the target audience

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,309
either for other engineers or for end

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:47,590
users or for managers decision makers

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:52,779
politicians that's not that easy and we

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:54,780
need them so our last chapter like in

00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:57,720
social human interaction

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,880
is what book or two books and one

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,340
website related to a book that I like

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,210
regarding social engineering that's the

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,650
spirit agent stuff

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,049
so how to flick people and give me

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,630
information or excess so that's one of

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,640
the books I read by the way the books

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm showing here are books that I own

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,400
and have more or less read and I like

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,659
them there are tons of other good books

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,970
these are one I actually enjoy abstract

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:31,169
and security staff you should known

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,789
first of all self-defense so it helps to

00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,340
eat your own dog food understand how to

00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:37,799
protect yourself you then explain users

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,289
how to they can protect themselves and

00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,450
also to learn how to make it easier for

00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:44,669
users to protect themselves and freedom

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,740
of the press has a very good training

00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:52,250
material for journalists even in

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,909
countries that always friendly yeah and

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,240
admin Thanks

00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:59,820
if you work in UNIX environment there's

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,650
one good book I have at the segmentation

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,789
of the third burners even more up to

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,500
date or man pages so if you do like back

00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,000
and development you want to know how

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,580
your braking system actually works in

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,770
its design that one helps other than

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,270
that any engineers does something with

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,450
Internet should actually know how like

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:22,380
IP for for IP for six verbs how like

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:25,650
firewalls work DNS very important read

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,260
headers should know as a Linux a bit and

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:31,440
there are tons of very good tools I

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,970
sometimes use and it are with the metal

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,820
like wire sharks and was a network

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:40,740
traffic and map Metasploit or dissembler

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:43,980
if you go in a bit deeper sock there for

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,159
big projects a the open web application

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:51,169
security project CB cwe

00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:53,940
in CVE and the ITF request for commands

00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:56,580
these are standard documentation and

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,190
good listing of security bugs and I

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,470
recommend you if you work in any kind of

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,750
development to keep track of that

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,470
especially the for web developers the Oh

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,110
a OWA is

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:11,350
is really helpful listing like common

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,419
abilities and you should be familiar

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:17,669
with these kinds of attacks as a

00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:20,590
front-end and web developer and party

00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,360
back-end developer we're really fun

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,389
funny still these days

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,990
XML attacks are dominant they're still

00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:31,539
in the top ten box applications but also

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,980
unicode there are fun things that are

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:34,570
like characters who looked at other

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,870
characters or if you have white

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,759
characters and do quoting normalization

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,490
the wrong order you can actually have

00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,570
like a persistent XSS it's not that the

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,250
other day programming languages to

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,610
understand security probably like very

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,889
low level things to write these days new

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,240
program new software probably use the

00:21:53,889 --> 00:22:02,950
right side because their memory safe um

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:05,710
cryptography three books the left man I

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,799
was my first cookbook actually bought oh

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,080
there's a kid that's more like a popular

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,960
science easy reading book from some

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,450
things painting crypto from like ancient

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,850
Egyptian to post quantum computer

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,190
thingies more like history book very

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,159
fascinating the book in the middle is a

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,690
bit dated but still good but I would not

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,730
use the book to design a new protocol

00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:31,210
but to understand like thinking and the

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:36,190
right one is a rather modern crypto book

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:38,289
by JP I'm a song also if you know a bit

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,659
mad a bit crypto that's good to reach

00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:43,480
other resources

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,279
there's the crypto or comfortably one

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,289
then boom encourage you can still sign

00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,169
up they just open up the signing port

00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:50,950
site three days ago four days ago I like

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,529
that

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,480
cook the pulse challenge and the last

00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:58,210
books also for free but that's actually

00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,490
super complex if you want to learn the

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,360
math behind like letters I don't

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,620
understand that but well and for Tila's

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,440
SSL Certificates

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,610
that's the standard book these days for

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,720
a long time we didn't have a send-up

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,789
book the CA d forum link that's the

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,280
setup used for all modern browsers and

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,150
see

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,470
the public for patent applications if

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,350
you still think you should have one

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,380
upper one lever one number really that

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,650
guy that's from this and you will no

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,750
longer think it's a good idea to have a

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,890
video or a web often what's coming up

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:39,980
now open might be connect 4mm protocol

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,500
that used like social network logins are

00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,920
good and Tory can't have a been pound

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,080
that it's a very useful site at least

00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,840
like you can even check your account if

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,270
you got exploited by an attacker some

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,860
mystic stuff so just some blog post

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,020
these prickly new site security news

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,810
about Linux try hunt again craps on

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,510
security Bruce Schneier and there's a

00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:05,930
also a monthly newsletter by a hand of

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,110
Burke about TLS things if you'd like to

00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:11,990
watch videos I recommend videos from

00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:15,440
these four conferences there are from

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:18,440
politics too easy to mind-boggling

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,980
complex things for case we put a clock

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,300
they usually have names like 35 c3 so it

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,780
makes a bit easier to find them on

00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,820
YouTube and here's a bunch of names from

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,710
people I follow on Twitter or read the

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:35,390
blog post they work for different

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:39,110
companies and just fun following them

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:42,110
amount of time and summary keep earning

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:44,450
experience and if you have more like

00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:52,040
links names or suggestions please

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:55,760
contact me yeah and hence early and

00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,010
don't use your own Krypton production at

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,920
that that's for you see mo

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:03,779
[Laughter]

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,840
[Applause]
