	Presentation name: Knative makes Developers Incredible on Serverless
Speaker: Daniel Oh
Description:  What makes your developers incredible to develop, deploy, manage modern serverless workload? With Knative, developers can create and deploy their own serverless on Kubernetes where they want then develop your functions with your language of choice. For example, OpenWhisk has rich support for your preferred serverless apps such as Python, Java. If those languages don't suit your needs, you can deploy your own app container to act as your function. Because the containers only spin up for a function when in use, resource usage can be minimized during idle times. 
In this session, you will learn how Knative makes it easier, quicker to develop, deploy, and manage your serverless app for enterprise developers with an understandable live demo.
