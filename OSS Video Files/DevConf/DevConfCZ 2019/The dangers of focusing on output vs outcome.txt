Title: The dangers of focusing on output vs outcome
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: The dangers of focusing on output vs outcome
Speaker: Jen Krieger
Description:  Have you heard these phrases at work in the past three months?
1. That's now how it works here. Or, that will never work here.
2. We can't move forward until we have a better solution designed.
3. We can't make a decision until we have everyone in the room.

The expectation to deliver high-quality, feature rich software faster while inadequately addressing the pressure of that has created an environment of high stress and low reward. Trying to change decades of ingrained habits comes at an understandable technology and human cost. 

In this talk, you will learn what behaviors are a result of cultures that put an emphasis on output vs. outcome, how you can mitigate them as technologists, and ultimately focus on achieving a healthy and empowered environment.

	00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,220
good morning everybody how many were out

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,320
late at a party last night got home too

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:19,650
late yeah so I noticed the the time

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,660
spent late at parties it seems to

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,249
indicate how far back in the audience

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:31,409
you sit yeah okay well I'll take a more

00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:33,270
scientific poll at some future date I'm

00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:35,280
Jen Krieger and I am the chief agile

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,590
architect at Red Hat in the product and

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,530
technologies division I know many of you

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,900
in the room I don't know all of you so

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,250
hopefully you will have fun in this

00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,720
session this morning also we're

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,540
competing with the session next door

00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,940
because they tried to get us to move so

00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,980
we have to laugh really loud we have to

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,480
clap really low really loud and make it

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,040
sound like we're having so much fun over

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,960
here I make sure that I am able to

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,680
switch slides here how many of you know

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,920
this guy

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
anybody great great for those of you who

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,120
have not watched the office this is

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,610
Michael Scott he is the epitome of the

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:17,220
world's best boss and the reason why I

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,680
wanted to talk to to talk to him is

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,680
because I feel like when we talk about

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,750
output versus outcome we have to really

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:33,900
understand why output is a focus for the

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:37,950
people who manage us and Michael is is a

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,820
a more I guess fuzzier or maybe more

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,450
bunny like version of the autocratic

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,060
manager that that we see on screen

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,390
because it's funny and he's personable

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,440
in a terrible way but one of the most

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,780
famous autocratic managers is this guy

00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:01,530
so as you I hope you all know who this

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,600
guy is right what one would hope for an

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,240
audience of this type that everybody

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,680
knows who Darth Vader is his his

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
management style was definitely

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,720
autocratic so let's talk a little bit

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,920
about autocratic management styles

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,920
obviously they tend to finger-point a

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,620
lot

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,730
apparently but really what it is is

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,940
they're responsible for all

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,490
decision-making and so at some point in

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,540
the the management lifecycle there was

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,490
an idea that if somebody was at the very

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,260
top and could make the decisions for

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,270
everybody else it would it would make

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,810
things go faster and I'm gonna talk

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,989
about why that is and where it came from

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,420
autocratic management also means that if

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,670
you're up here at the top you also are

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,350
probably discouraging ideas feedback or

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,420
input from a larger group of people

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,790
because the idea is that you own that

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,890
decision and therefore whatever you

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,830
think is right is likely the right

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,540
decision to make so groupthink is not

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,500
necessarily a thing in this particular

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,209
situation and because the decision is

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,560
being made at a very high level output

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:13,630
is often very structured heavily managed

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,739
and incredibly closely scrutinized y'all

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,959
know this as command and control

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:19,299
management this is kind of the the

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,640
naughty words that we use to describe

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,470
what it feels like now I'm gonna take

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,260
you a little bit back here and explain

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,980
where it came from so this is the

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,959
wonderful graphic from Wikipedia that I

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,880
found that explains the Industrial

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,390
Revolution we don't necessarily need to

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,190
worry about back here in the Neolithic

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,350
Age where we're working with you know

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,790
stone bronze and iron tools but really

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,829
what happened here in the first row of

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,660
first revolution is we started working

00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,239
with automated tools that would help us

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,400
do our jobs better but the jobs that we

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,610
were doing were very repetitive very

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,260
manual and unknown we knew that we had

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,930
to pick up something and put it over

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,030
here or we had to turn a crank to get

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,820
something to go so everybody knew what

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,380
that job was it was predictable moving

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,959
into steam engines the same thing

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,000
happened and primarily the way that

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,950
people were motivated in this period of

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,829
time through the waterwheel steam engine

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,690
all the way into the third the third

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,570
Industrial Revolution which is right

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,910
around here all of the all of the things

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,460
that we were doing were able to be

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,050
documented or described in a certain way

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,289
that made it very easy for people

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,000
understand what was expected of them

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:34,710
enter in the age of the automobile and

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,360
the aircraft and that was where a lot of

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,849
technology advancements started to occur

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,560
where they were taking certain things

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:43,569
that they were doing and saying we could

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,150
actually have a cost savings if we used

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,520
a robot to move things around or if we

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,220
used a computer to program the software

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,639
to make certain adjustments as we were

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,810
creating pieces of pieces of the actual

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,599
automobile that that enhancement started

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,520
creating less a lesser need for people

00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:05,319
who were picking things up and moving

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,940
them over because instead of people

00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:11,319
picking things up and moving them over

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,150
we now had automation doing that into

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,460
the information revolution or the

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,340
digital revolution which is where we are

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,969
today this is a great graphic that I'd

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,219
love to show you we now know that you

00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:26,319
can see down here the routine cognitive

00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:28,900
workers and manual workers and some of

00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,169
the non routine manual workers you can

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,449
see I think it's probably around 1885 or

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:37,930
nine 1885 really that was a wee long

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:41,380
time ago 1985 is about where the digital

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,639
revolution is starting ish it might have

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,770
been a little bit earlier a little bit

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,330
later but you can see the rise of the

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,849
knowledge workers starting to happen

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,190
there and if you didn't know you are all

00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:54,520
knowledge workers and knowledge workers

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:57,009
are people who have to do unpredictable

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,430
things and somebody has a problem and

00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:02,529
needs a solution and from the problem to

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,930
the solution it may not be predictable

00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,729
it may not be automatable you have to do

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,069
some thinking and that's why we call you

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:13,150
knowledge workers now the problem with

00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:14,979
this scenario is that while this is

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,599
happening and you can see it's not

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,120
really a whole lot of time here where

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,779
we're talking maybe about 30 years at

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,719
that point

00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,969
all the managers are still managing like

00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,029
they have a bunch of cognitive manual

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:31,000
predictable work and so they're taking

00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,919
those things that really worked to help

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,800
people who were doing repetitive tasks

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,990
so the value of somebody who's doing I'm

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,650
going to create this one piece of a

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,810
machine and I'm going to pass it down

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,220
line the value that they provide is

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,530
output right

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,009
how many cogs can you get through the

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,960
machine and a day for knowledge workers

00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,250
it's not necessarily the cogs that

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,650
you're passing through the machine that

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,910
is the value but the managers are still

00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,300
in that space where they're

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:01,990
understanding that output was what they

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,850
were measuring before and unfortunately

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,070
well while social psychology and

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:10,370
organizational psychology knows that we

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,690
have to change the research hasn't

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,710
really had a whole lot of time to

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,940
actually figure out what that means so

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:21,440
back to this guy again

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:23,270
so we still have the situation today in

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,039
the workplace a lot of the managers that

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,130
I work with on a day-to-day basis really

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:33,080
don't understand how to incentivize or

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,639
or help folks like like you learn or get

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,430
better at what you're doing and so we're

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,080
still really in a place where

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:43,639
unfortunately we have a lot of command

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,669
and control management the good news is

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,320
is even in 2014 Forbes pursued this

00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:51,190
really great article if you ever want to

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,510
read it the link is in the slide deck

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,690
managers are realizing they do need to

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,639
change so you can see on on the

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,110
left-hand side that is really the the

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,849
management style of the past is very

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,099
similar to some of the things that you

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,080
would expect from autocratic management

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,150
or somebody saying do what I do what I

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,550
tell you to do and do it now we're

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,050
really kind of in in the present for for

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,620
a lot of the managers certainly at Red

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,270
Hat I see I see the an evolution of

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,099
where we were on the left before and now

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,500
we're kind of starting to take a firm

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,780
step into the middle it's not Universal

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,380
of course but we're starting to see that

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,870
maybe instead of using authority to

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,029
motivate people we're trying to coach or

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,680
move them in a certain direction by

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,630
influence or by having a conversation

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,599
with them instead of yelling at them to

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,510
get something done in this space we

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,330
really want to focus on improvement and

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,010
so it becomes less of a job of a manager

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,930
to focus on the output that the employee

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,089
is producing but rather on their health

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,010
and well-being as an individual so the

00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:54,530
conversation might look like

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,970
so I have two of my associates in the

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,700
room right now so I'm gonna pick on them

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,240
so Pavel if I was in the autocratic

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,550
management space I might say to him okay

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,640
so you were working with two scrum teams

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,370
over the last you know here where are

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,170
all the reports to show their velocity I

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,500
want to see the output of your work so I

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:18,680
can really know that you are doing

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,560
something it but but in reality what it

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,390
looks like for I hope and he can he can

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,220
tell you after after the session whether

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,380
I'm doing a good job or not what it

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,910
might look like is Pavel what are your

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,740
what are your goals for the year what

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,390
would you like to achieve is there

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,580
anything that you might want to learn or

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,830
is there anything that is troubling you

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,800
at work that you're really not sure what

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,320
to do about that we can help find either

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,880
a mentor or find some training or find

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,830
something that will fill that gap that

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,460
you have and so that is really where

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,170
management is moving into the future and

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,490
it's it's amusing to me that this the

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,650
the future part of this the

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,480
right-hand-side almost looks exactly

00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,120
like what I would expect a scrum master

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,980
to be doing for a scrum team this is

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,310
really where the future of Management is

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,810
going it's somebody who looks for the

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,790
thing that is going to block that

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,830
knowledge worker before it even happens

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,150
and so they're kind of they're laying

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,540
the tracks I don't know if you've all

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,860
seen me the video of the Train that's

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,060
moving and the people are in the front

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,100
and the Train they're laying the tracks

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,650
right before the train is going what

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,210
what I'm suggesting is the manager is

00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,980
kind of laying the tracks in front of

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,480
the employee before they get there so

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,900
that they're constantly moving in the

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,520
direction without being disrupted by

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,320
things that might prevent them from

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:39,920
being able to reach their overall

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:42,320
potential okay so now we're in the age

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,630
of technology I'm excited to be in the

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,040
age of technology I feel like I've been

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,180
in the age of technology since I was

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,430
born and the interesting thing about the

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,970
age of technology is everything that we

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,940
do

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,880
that looks repetitive can be automated

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:03,680
and business is moving faster and faster

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,080
and faster and so now where we are is

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,140
you know look 30 years ago or even look

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,690
five years ago there really wasn't a

00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,839
huge reason why a manager would have to

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,630
change their behavior because quite

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,700
frankly it was still possible to manage

00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,950
a team of people and to manage a

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,600
business without changing the behavior

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,940
of the management team it was quite

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,640
possible to continue to have the same

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,550
type of earnings the same type of

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,130
experience the same type of customer

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,250
engagement that you might have had in

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:40,550
previous you know years but now we're in

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:43,310
a situation where if you are in to the

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,890
fastest to market if you aren't the

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,140
fastest to get your idea out the door

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,150
you are now in a situation where your

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,060
competitor can come in and sweep right

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,220
into where you are and essentially do

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,320
what you were planning on doing and so

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,690
it's not there there's no crunching

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,540
there's no shouting there's no there

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,370
there's no you know looming over someone

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,800
to get the output that you need it

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,589
doesn't work and so management styles

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,020
have been pressured in the recent years

00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:16,279
to actually find what does work because

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:17,870
the shouting wasn't working and and

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,080
unfortunately they're now in a situation

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:25,209
where fiscally speaking they they have

00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,209
no choice anymore they have to change

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,860
okay so now now we know why we are in

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:33,950
the situation where you might you might

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,170
be at work and you might have a manager

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,600
or you might have a leader who is

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,209
interested in your output you understand

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,450
where they are you understand the the

00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:47,450
progress and quite frankly the fact that

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:51,410
there is there is really not much social

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,060
science not much research that shows

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,450
them where that what they should be

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,130
doing

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,740
and how they should be doing it and

00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,240
quite frankly if you want to learn how

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,640
to get better as a manager you're

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,950
looking at like a I was looking for

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,560
classes in the United States just as a

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,750
curiosity I found some leadership

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,060
classes and it's like $10,000 for you to

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,820
go for a week to learn how to be a

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,410
better manager and so it in some cases

00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,880
it can be quite outside the reach

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,590
if you want to go and improve the the

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,630
classes that you could take are just so

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,860
outrageous expensive that it's unlikely

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,220
that you're going to be able to afford

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,920
them and quite frankly knowing is half

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,230
the battle because if you know why your

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,050
manager might be asking for a particular

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,180
thing or you you know where that style

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,160
of management came from you might be

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,830
able to then see it from their eyes and

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,830
know how to actually combat or how to

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,990
actually push that type of request away

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,030
what what would you respond with that

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,280
might help them to think about your work

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,470
differently I'm gonna play a little bit

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,480
of a game when we're talking about

00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,220
behaviors and so you can pull out your

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,450
phones or your laptops or whatever you

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,310
have that will connect you to the

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,730
internet because and I'm hoping this

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,970
works

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,620
it was slow before so who makes the

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,990
decisions this is the scenario we're

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,970
talking about so a project you are

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,070
working on keeps getting stalled each

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,410
time your team gets to a critical point

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,860
you wait a few days until your manager

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,450
has the time to decide the direction one

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,570
time the team couldn't wait and made a

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,430
decision it was the wrong one time money

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,850
and effort was spent on something that

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:32,430
got discarded your manager was upset and

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:38,720
so let's do this it's got a load a

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:42,960
little give me a sec okay all right so

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,240
using your poll is active activate okay

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,240
if you can do me a favor and respond

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,880
doesn't show the actual there we go

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,270
great and I'll leave it open for a

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,270
little bit

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:07,140
it's interesting it doesn't tell you

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:13,020
what a B and C is in my when I made this

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:17,160
slide a was always be was sometimes and

00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,540
C was never once you do the first one it

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:28,800
will be easier every single time

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:31,680
afterwards oh I love to know

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,790
thank you you knows I love the fact that

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,010
some of you have not been in this

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:40,800
situation before but this is about what

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,620
I have it was I'm expecting to see and I

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,030
am amused that it does not do a full

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,530
screen even though it's a full screen

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:52,770
over here it's about what I expected and

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:54,840
and it's interesting that we see the

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,090
polarity between the nose and the esses

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,670
see the fact that the sometimes isn't as

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:07,380
big as I was you know it's not like a

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:10,500
fully 30 33.33% of each pie but what

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:14,460
this shows me too is that some of you

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,380
have situations where your management is

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,930
still firmly in the autocratic way of

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,640
working where they require all decisions

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,380
to be passed through them or they

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,120
require that they are a touch point to

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,370
prevent you from making a mistake and

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,200
about 35 percent of you are saying

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,820
that's not actually true that you can

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,680
move forward without having to wait for

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,290
that for that question to be answered

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,630
for that decision to be answered and you

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,270
have potential buy-in from your manager

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:42,210
that if you do make a mistake it's okay

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:47,070
because we'll just recover from that a

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:49,470
little bit of a tip - the reason why the

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,180
reason why that scenario occurs and in

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,280
fact all of these scenarios are from

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,200
previous job that I used to work at the

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,030
reason why the manager would want to

00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,370
have that decision made in my particular

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:03,240
instance was because it would take us

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:06,150
between I would say on a good on a good

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,809
project nine months - on a bad project

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,269
18 months - ax

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:13,509
get something to production and so that

00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:16,120
that period of time was so long that

00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:17,919
they wanted to prevent mistakes so they

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,720
required the decisions to go through

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,699
them because they didn't want us to get

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,350
to 18 months and find out we had

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,860
deployed something that no one could use

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:29,679
which is a pretty usual thing but as we

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,899
as we shortened the delivery time we're

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,509
getting faster feedback which means it's

00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:36,700
easier for managers to trust that if you

00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:39,370
do make a mistake it's easier to recover

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:44,110
and it's not gonna take 18 months to fix

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:46,869
what it was that happened okay so the

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,369
behavior change that that is functional

00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:50,649
and real in this space is called

00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:53,889
decentralized decision making it is

00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:56,200
really hard to change an organization to

00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:59,919
take that manager who makes all those

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,299
decisions to a model in which anyone can

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,909
make a decision within a certain

00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:05,860
guidance and so for individual

00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:08,110
contributors what this really looks like

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,929
for you is listening and communicating

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,700
with your management structure with the

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,710
people who are defining what it is that

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,049
you are supposed to be working on it

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,869
might it might manifest as a community

00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,240
of people on open-source project that

00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:24,519
you're working on it might be your

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,740
manager who is defining the technical

00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,049
direction for the team it may be a

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,210
product manager or a product owner but

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,549
it's the when they're talking don't just

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:37,090
go the you know all they say is bla bla

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:39,179
bla bla bla bla bla go Oh what is it

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,279
you're talking about let me listen to

00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:44,049
understand and then ask questions if I

00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:48,159
don't that's what listen and communicate

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:51,100
means consistent delivery helps right so

00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,749
if you have a manager who is anxious

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,049
about knowing what it is you're working

00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:59,019
on be if you say I will have that done

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:02,080
by this day and you continue to fail to

00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:04,749
deliver it on that day over and over and

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,970
over again that person is gonna be more

00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:08,889
likely to say well okay it's clear that

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,919
I can't trust you to do what you said

00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:14,350
you were going to do so I'm just going

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,240
to have to make all the decisions now

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,570
consistent delivery also implies that

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,480
you somehow can magically know how

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:24,809
something's going to take right which is

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,950
which is false and oftentimes severely

00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:30,809
untrue however perhaps they'll listen

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,789
and communicate part also wraps around

00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:35,100
that consistent delivery so if you know

00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,809
you're not going to deliver or you know

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,490
that you said the wrong thing like I

00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:41,130
said I would be done next week but it's

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,570
I looked at the code or I opened up the

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,460
document I had to write and I realized

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,009
that was far more work than I would have

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,929
ever thought it to be don't just suffer

00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:50,940
in silence you know don't just say well

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,529
I'm working on that thing you know

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,480
tomorrow we'll be working on that thing

00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,710
again you should say something that

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,690
looks like well I'm working on that

00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,220
thing and I looked at the code and I

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,899
realized that when I'm looking at this

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,730
code there's all these other things that

00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,200
need changing in order to support this

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,929
over here so it might take a little bit

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,389
longer than my fall and if they say well

00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:12,269
why then you can show them right it's

00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:14,460
just about making sure to inform them of

00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:17,759
an updated in a piece of information

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,710
that you have and then finally and this

00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,200
is the hardest one I find with engineers

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,879
is the understanding and connecting the

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,490
Y with what you're doing and so

00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:28,740
oftentimes we have some someone up here

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,860
on high saying you know bloody lofty

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,870
goal this is the direction please go in

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,269
this direction and then you're down here

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,009
fixing a bug and you're going that bug

00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,059
has nothing to do with that thing that

00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,679
they just talked about

00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,970
therefore I'm just going to forget that

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,700
they said anything because it's not

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,519
really an input into what I'm doing

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,230
and oftentimes teams have a really hard

00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,659
time connecting what they're doing up

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,090
here but that doesn't mean you shouldn't

00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:55,500
try and it doesn't necessarily mean

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,419
you'll be able to connect all the work

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,309
you're doing but you might be able to

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,500
say this is the ecosystem of all the

00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:04,350
things I have been working on how do I

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,389
fit in that larger picture so understand

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,299
and try to connect the work you're doing

00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:11,100
and even better if you can understand it

00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:16,049
and let me let me turn this off like

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:18,659
seriously seriously why is this on thank

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:20,460
you if you can if you can finally

00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:22,259
understand and connect it then you could

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,269
probably help the people around you by

00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,159
being able to communicate it and so

00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:27,690
oftentimes business people speak in

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,550
languages that you don't understand

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,500
right they use words that make no sense

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,030
better probably buzzwords so you can

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,230
look up them up on the internet and read

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,210
the definition of what they are and

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,140
still not understand what that means I

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:44,650
am in the same boat okay it's all the

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,360
time so but if you can take if you

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,610
finally get it and you can finally

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,880
connect it with whatever's going up here

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,830
and you you can communicate it in your

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,840
own language to the person sitting next

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,910
to you who may not get it then you're

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,090
helping that person also connect so

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,680
level up and try that so now let's talk

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,810
about the manager or the line manager

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,500
role that middle manager the guy the

00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:10,180
pointy-haired boss it's my favorite boss

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,830
so obviously they also need to listen

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,720
convinced are there any managers in the

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,700
room I don't want to like out you yeah I

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,090
know I see some of them right you're

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,800
like don't ask me to raise my hand you

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,890
also need to listen and communicate and

00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,500
so this is this is hard because of one

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,210
very specific reason oftentimes

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,740
especially in your if you're in that

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,270
position of just please get something

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,490
done because you've not done anything

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,040
and somebody says well I don't know why

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,920
I'm working on this you might go not

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,200
again right but the reality is is that

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,760
it's your job as a manager and I'm not

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,900
making any eye contact with any of the

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,000
managers now it's your job as a manager

00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,490
to make sure those people who work for

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,740
you understand what it is they're trying

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,000
to do and understand where the company

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,240
is going and understand how that

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,800
connects that that and actually if you

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,240
stay for the next talk we have yawns

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,580
Alania who's going to talk about that

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,840
stuff talk about connecting the Y with

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:10,990
the work provide the what not how we

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,210
often have especially in technology what

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,460
winds up happening is our software

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,850
engineers take a career track right it

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,180
could be up through you know I am the

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,190
most

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,460
uber engineer that has ever lived on the

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,440
planet career track or it might go up

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,180
the I will now go into management and

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,970
management and then manage other

00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,220
engineers and oftentimes when they take

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,680
the career path into management they

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,870
take all the things that they knew about

00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,600
doing technology with them which then

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:43,010
manifests as I will tell you how to

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,430
write that code or I will tell you

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:48,110
what equipment to buy for your situation

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,060
meanwhile quite frankly they are not

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,310
coding they're not keeping up with the

00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,650
new technologies they're not maybe they

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,720
are but they may not be learning just

00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,000
like somebody who's in it is learning

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,830
every day and so they might be mint they

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,880
might be saying things that just don't

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,130
make sense anymore

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,630
right I've seen it happen not with the

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,930
people in this room but I've seen it

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:12,170
happen so just just understand you're

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,180
you're helping your team understand what

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:17,660
it is they're trying to do not how

00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,640
they're trying to do it and be clear

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,680
about delegation don't hover so what I

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,180
mean by this is that there are gonna be

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,650
certain decisions that you're gonna be

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,270
ok with the team making there's gonna be

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,880
certain decisions you're not ok with the

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,340
team making a really basic example of

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,960
this is you're probably gonna be ok with

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,180
the team making decisions about when

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,180
they go to the bathroom right you do not

00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,430
want to say here's your hallway pass to

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,810
go to the toilet that is not something

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,510
that you're gonna want to help them make

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,520
a decision on but you may not be okay

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,310
with them making a decision as certainly

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,470
if you're in a support role to take PTO

00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,420
all at the same time leaving you the

00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,940
only person to answer you know the

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,380
escalation that comes in at 3:00 a.m. so

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,200
that might be something that you choose

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,600
not to allow the team to decide but if

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,920
you're not clear about that and gosh if

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,930
you're if you're asking for permission

00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,700
to go to the restroom I really want to

00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,770
have a conversation with you but if

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,550
you're not clear about the fact that you

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,560
want to talk to the team when a certain

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,330
holiday is coming up and organize who's

00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,940
gonna be on and who's not gonna be in

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,110
the office then then like what's gonna

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,970
happen is people are gonna submit their

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,560
PTO and then when you get you know a

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,170
wall of PTO submitted and you have to

00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,270
say well not everybody can take PTO then

00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,430
you're gonna look like the jerk and so

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,290
you want to actually be clear hey in

00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,950
this particular situation before it

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,080
happens

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,430
before we have emotions before we've

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,230
bought plane tickets before we've done

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,390
all these things we need to have a

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,150
conversation as a team so we understand

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,070
who is out who is in and then decide

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:53,000
together who you know just decide

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,710
together and then finally the open and

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,010
transparent one of the things that I

00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,020
learned very early

00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,590
in my management career was that with

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,990
the travel budget that my team has

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,090
hiding it from them looked bad and so

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,400
they would say hey could I go or hey

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,780
could I you know do this and then I

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,510
would have to say yes or no based on

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:16,200
information that I had it was better for

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,910
me to say hey look I we don't have the

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,980
money here's the money that we have

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,419
here's the thing you're asking here's

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,309
all the things that we planned on doing

00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,410
is that thing more important than any of

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:27,179
the plan things and just show everybody

00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,220
what it is that we planned

00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,200
because then that changes the

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,570
conversation for me making the decision

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,250
with information in my head to me saying

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,250
hey look at the information that y'all

00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,900
gave me and see what we plan for the

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,400
year and then make a decision and if

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,500
it's if it's more important than the

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,090
other things then let's talk about it as

00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,080
a team and figure out how we can make

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,570
that other thing go away

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,480
it's just it's easier to be open and

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:55,020
transparent it really is and then of

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,590
course the executive or leader my lovely

00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,150
CEO Kat again listen to communicate I

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,340
don't think we have may executives in

00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,690
the room right okay but they might

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,960
listen to the recording so I can't say

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,870
anything bad okay also to provide the

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,690
what not the hell I again if you follow

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,299
the same logic that we were following

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,950
the line manager it's oftentimes that

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,540
your executives have a technical

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,790
background and they're even further

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,679
removed from the days that they coded

00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,559
something or they installed something

00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,990
and so they might say well you know I

00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,429
used to code in COBOL back in the day

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,020
and that sounds like a good programming

00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:32,790
language for you to use

00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,740
you know what I mean like that might be

00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,299
what you're hearing and so for

00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,760
executives we definitely want you to

00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:42,330
focus on the what absolutely not the

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,549
hell and again be clear in delegations

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,679
and the same thing applies and also be

00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:49,350
open and transparent that's can be

00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,210
harder to do as an executive there's

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,320
gonna be absolutely decisions that

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,340
they're not gonna be able to share with

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,679
you a common and popular one would be

00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,360
mergers and acquisitions it is likely

00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,190
that they're not going to announce to

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,470
the company we are planning on buying

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:08,190
this thing because it is against the law

00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,779
in most countries and so I have noticed

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,340
Engineers still have a hard time with

00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:13,309
that but that would be an example of

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,110
something they wouldn't be able to share

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:18,389
okay so another scenario so who does the

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,029
most work

00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,899
this guy is drew drew toothpaste if you

00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:23,490
don't know who he is you should

00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,809
definitely follow him on the Internet

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,309
he's pretty funny

00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,649
your manager pulls you aside and says

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:29,759
you're having a good year but I ran some

00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:31,559
numbers and it looks like you're doing

00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,990
less than the rest of the team let's

00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,100
talk about that in our next one-on-one

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,779
meanwhile you go off and you're having a

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,970
heart attack right oh god like you're

00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,919
sweating I and you're dreading that next

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,590
one-on-one how many have been there I've

00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,389
been there right it's it's that next

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,190
one-on-one where you're dreading all of

00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,360
you didn't raise your hand I love that

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,629
you didn't raise your hand or you're

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:57,929
just not being honest right okay so

00:28:51,629 --> 00:29:01,379
let's vote a is yes a B is sometimes Oh

00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:05,750
let me reset the poll sorry guys their

00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:05,750
results there we go all right vote

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,410
oh I love that you're saying no this

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,820
this actually is a really good exercise

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:25,230
for me because it's good to see had I

00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,840
have asked this question at previous

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:31,740
conferences and in earlier years and I

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,530
have seen a much different skewed skewed

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:43,590
result it's definitely gotten far more

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:45,419
yeses than knows in the past okay so

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,740
that's really good news for everybody so

00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,350
we're we're moving away from an

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,700
autocratic management style as shown by

00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,970
this poll we're not necessarily

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,220
interested in focusing on comparing you

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:59,370
to others which is good we're not really

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,960
interested in focusing on the number of

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,620
things you do compared to the number of

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,780
things somebody else does which is good

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,750
okay so evaluate employees against

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,880
professional goals so it you might feel

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,070
like that that behavior change does not

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,080
apply to you as an interval individual

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,500
contributor but the reality is is that

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,080
it does and the things that you can do

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,150
is is simple like so say I say to you

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,850
hey what are your professional goals and

00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:31,020
you say and that's what you say right

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,130
how many of you are gonna say that to me

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,280
if I ask you what your professional

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,289
goals are okay a few of you yeah it's

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,179
okay there's like I'm just coding for a

00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:43,799
living that's my professional go living

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:47,340
the dream right well you know it was a

00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,320
dream I would recommend finding a mentor

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,240
maybe somebody who is further along in

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,610
their career who can talk to you about

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,409
what living the dream looks like after

00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:58,650
they've been in the career for 20 years

00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:59,850
right some folks really do get energy

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,710
from writing code every day and they

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,360
really just want to write code other

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,470
folks actually do want to have

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,030
progression they want to learn new

00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:08,010
technologies they want to learn new

00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,990
things and they want to actually move

00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,850
forward in their career or figure out

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,309
how to get on that new hot technology

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:19,320
instead of coding bugs and doing the

00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:20,880
same thing day after day proactively to

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,290
find your professional goals so don't

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,190
wait for your manager to tell you what

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,409
your professional goals are

00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,669
of an opinion before you show up that is

00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:30,460
a really important thing because

00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:32,620
otherwise that manager is gonna go well

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,240
I got an HR goal to meet I've got to

00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,309
actually have a professional goal for

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,960
every video reports to me this person

00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:40,179
doesn't have a freshman goal so here is

00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,250
your assignment now and that may not

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:43,809
look like what you like I've known

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,919
people who have assigned a professional

00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:49,360
goal to engineers of public speaking and

00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,980
I'm like that's not a good professional

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,179
goal for an engineer that might be a

00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,519
good professional goal for you as a

00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:56,679
manager but maybe not necessarily a

00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,350
universal professional goal for somebody

00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:00,940
who doesn't want to stand up in front of

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,850
a crowd of people and do professional

00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,620
speaking so you want to be having an

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,259
opinion before somebody tells you what

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:12,070
it is that you want to do and I swear

00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:14,409
this thing stop bringing up the it will

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,389
go away and the last thing is if you

00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:17,649
were at a point where you actually feel

00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:19,840
comfortable and you know what your

00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,669
professional goals are find somebody

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,860
who's looking for a mentor and help them

00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:25,600
out because very frankly there are a lot

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,129
of people out there who are very junior

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,200
who are looking for somebody who's a

00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:30,789
little bit senior who can help them kind

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,610
of guide through the miasma of all the

00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:36,190
tech that's out there even Dan Walsh

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,570
will tell me he cannot keep up and so if

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,090
you are somebody who can keep up with

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,679
all the new things that are coming out

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:45,220
then you have some sort of superpower

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,710
that I don't have for line or middle

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,059
managers this is this is really you

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,639
really need to listen and communicate

00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:54,279
here the last one was like listen

00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:56,169
communicate this one is really listened

00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,570
to what your employee is saying if they

00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:00,730
are saying to you I don't really have a

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:04,840
professional goal I just want a cone

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:08,379
then just let them code right they don't

00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,850
it it's okay it's really okay don't tell

00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:13,360
them what they want to do that's not

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,549
healthy learn to ask what the employee

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,350
wants don't tell them what they want I

00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:19,120
can't tell you how many times I've been

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,769
in a conversation with a manager where

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,059
they've said well I you know I had a

00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:23,500
conversation my employee the other day

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:25,029
and they were telling me that they had

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,799
two paths they could take and I just

00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:28,480
said this path looks better go there and

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,179
I'm like do you know what they want to

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,009
do did you ask them why they were

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,869
interested in this path why they might

00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:35,360
like what what did you ask them what the

00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:36,740
pros

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,750
cons are did you ask what they were

00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,309
thinking about and oftentimes it's

00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,290
shorthand management room just said just

00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:44,179
go with the one that looks sexier or or

00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:46,880
how we'll have you know more people over

00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,710
there or will make better benefit for

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,770
the company that's also shorthand

00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,230
management and then don't like this part

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:57,170
of your job learn to love it or leave

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,150
that job because you are a people

00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,000
manager you're not a technology manager

00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:04,010
you are not a product manager you are a

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,410
people manager and there's a reason why

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,760
we call you people managers and then

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,619
finally for the executive or leader

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,230
again working on listening and

00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:14,030
communicating I really want us to move

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,760
away from annual performance reviews as

00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:22,010
an industry because they are yeah I mean

00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:23,840
seriously thank you and here's the

00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,210
reason why because I really want us to

00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,310
evaluate team performance not individual

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,590
because most of you work on teams most

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:34,060
of you work on a with a with some other

00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:36,619
person normally right and so if you are

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,290
dependent on a team of people to get

00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:43,730
something done why are we evaluating you

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:45,889
individually really I don't know why we

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,240
do that we we the industry I don't

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,909
really know a whole lot of companies

00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:53,030
that allocate bonus based on a team

00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,220
situation so we tell people work as a

00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,920
team collaborate as a team get work done

00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,859
as a team here's your bonus individual

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,230
employee it creates a little bit of a

00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:06,080
weird situation right there's a limit

00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,700
between the two things okay

00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,760
last scenario and we're gonna speed up

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,690
here so I am bored with my job every day

00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,460
you come to work

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,960
open your work you you pick up an item

00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,910
at the top of the work queue and you

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,010
work on that you get distracted and you

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,990
work on something else then you go back

00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,359
to the first thing you do this seven and

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,670
eight hours straight and you go home you

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,000
do this next day again there's no end in

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:32,359
sight and nothing will ever be done has

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,100
this happened to you in the past I mean

00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,480
okay everybody's really excited to

00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:40,700
answer this one let me clear the results

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:42,859
first and I'm a pretty emotive speaker

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,609
so I was trying to talk in monotone it

00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:45,609
doesn't work very well

00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,030
whoops

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,369
okay yeah sometimes we have more yeses

00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:00,760
and sometimes then we have nose again

00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:03,210
you nose or live in the dream you really

00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,069
live in the dream

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,510
well after after thank you after class

00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:11,099
we're going to find out where you're

00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,099
working so we can come work with you

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:18,220
okay so we have a lot of yeses so it's a

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,109
behavior change that you need to do here

00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,780
is finding the Y the goal the objective

00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:24,069
so again the individual contributor this

00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,750
is going to be a repeat of what I said

00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:27,849
before you really do need to connect

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,410
your work with the Y you really need to

00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:30,940
understand what it is you're doing it

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,290
may not be every piece of work that

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,420
you're doing that is going to be able to

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,420
be connected to a Y but you really

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,910
should try to connect something to why

00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,829
you are working for that company I think

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,660
the reason why that bar keeps coming up

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:47,319
sorry limit your work in progress

00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,849
so this is a really hard one for

00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:51,069
engineers because we often like to have

00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:52,630
more than one thing going at a time but

00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:53,980
if you're doing more than one thing at a

00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,690
time and it feels a little bit more

00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,490
harried where you're not able to spend

00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,589
or focus on that one other thing over

00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,000
here and you save yourself gosh I really

00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:02,440
wish I had time to work on that thing

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,869
over here but I'm too busy over here

00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,030
with all these other 15 things maybe you

00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,470
should take a step back and say maybe I

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,069
should like you don't have to do one

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,770
thing at a time

00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:13,960
I give you permission to not do one

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,119
thing at a time even though I've made my

00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,619
my two employees in the room incredibly

00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:18,990
uncomfortable by saying that they're

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,690
like what are you talking about Jenn

00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,490
maybe maybe you do only two things maybe

00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,200
you do only three things and maybe you

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,609
shut off all of your notifications for

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,369
email chat and all those other things

00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:33,670
for a period of time and focus for just

00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:35,170
a little while and then ask yourself

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,640
what should what could you change to

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,349
make this better and so if you really

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,000
are in a situation where you're doing

00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:41,980
they'll slog through the same thing

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,079
every day and there's really no end in

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,549
sight you're creating counts you're

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,970
fixing the same bug over and over and

00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:48,010
over again

00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,630
what could you do better to change that

00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,980
is there some automation that you could

00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,170
be doing is there some way that you

00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,200
could improve the situation that you're

00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,140
in maybe a co-worker has the same

00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,969
problem and you can work on it together

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,130
so line or middleman

00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:04,539
I really want you to measure the

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,430
throughput of the work not the

00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:08,739
individual and really what this means is

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,319
if you watch a piece of work go through

00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:14,469
a system so it's to do doing and done

00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:16,660
every section of that system will have

00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:18,369
an overall average of how long it takes

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,019
that to get through the system so

00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:22,180
instead of looking at every piece of

00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:24,099
work and knowing when it goes out the

00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,289
system you want to look at the high

00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:28,089
level like the overall of all the work

00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:29,589
and you know what you'll find is

00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:31,539
there'll be a band in the middle that

00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:33,339
will show you what looks like normal and

00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:36,039
then there'll be outliers things that

00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:38,859
take far longer to fix and things that

00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:40,660
take a lot of less time to fix and what

00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:42,279
you want to focus on are those outliers

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,229
you want to look for the things that are

00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:45,519
stalling look for the things that are

00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:47,289
breaking look for the things that are

00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,739
not getting done and find out why that

00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,839
is

00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,849
maybe there's missing equipment maybe

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,130
there's lack of skill set maybe people

00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:55,779
just don't know how to fix it maybe the

00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,880
team is waiting on another team who is

00:38:55,779 --> 00:39:00,630
not answering questions and so you

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,890
really want to focus on those outliers

00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,829
you want to ensure the team swarms so

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,779
contrary the opposite of the work on how

00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:09,459
many things you want to work on if you

00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:12,969
have a really important thing that needs

00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:15,039
doing put more than one person on it say

00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:17,079
this is a really important thing we need

00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,299
the entire team to rally around it is

00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,430
there anything we can do together to get

00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:23,049
that done faster now

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,289
the mythical man-month states that it's

00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:28,479
probably not true that you'll be able to

00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,339
get through it faster but there might be

00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:32,319
some things that somebody can do that

00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:34,930
someone else can't while they're working

00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:36,400
on the code and then ensure that the

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,930
team understands what the priority is

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,489
and why you've said it that way

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,430
so maybe they can do the priority

00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:45,009
setting themselves ok executives are

00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,749
leaders you really want well-defined

00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:48,130
product roadmaps that people understand

00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:50,410
where you're going and if you don't have

00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:54,009
them the organization is doing something

00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:57,099
wrong you want outcome or that cost

00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:58,779
creating customer value you that is what

00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:01,930
you want to insist on from your teams

00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:02,829
they can I I'm out of talent time but

00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:08,170
I'm gonna keep going

00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:09,459
sorry I'm bleeding into my Q&A now you

00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,709
really want to make sure that people

00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,960
understand that they can do some work

00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,150
that doesn't

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,900
benefit the customer but you really want

00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:21,750
to focus on getting most of the work for

00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,730
customer value and then finally 10 this

00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,670
is my level up accept strategy pull

00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:29,220
requests if if you say this is the

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,720
strategic direction of a company maybe

00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,890
you want to listen when somebody says

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,260
that doesn't really make a whole lot of

00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,700
sense because of these reasons they may

00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,620
be saying something you already knew and

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,210
you've discarded but they might have an

00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,300
idea of something that you didn't see

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:44,070
before so you probably should listen

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,500
okay we're going to go through this next

00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,810
session pretty quickly and so the

00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,700
dangers of outcome or output over

00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,820
outcome and how many of you remember

00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,670
Qwikster anybody

00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:58,680
it's a Netflix hooha right Netflix in

00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,390
2011 I'm going to briefly tell you what

00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,190
happened announced that it was going to

00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,680
separate its streaming services from his

00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,120
DVD delivery service I'm not sure that

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,340
it was here in the Czech Republic at the

00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,280
time but what they did was they said

00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,110
you're paying $7.99 a month for Netflix

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,270
and you can either do DVD or streaming

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:18,450
it's just one price then they announce

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:21,270
you have to pay $7.99 for the DVDs in

00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:23,430
the mail or and $7.99 for the streaming

00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,410
and the reason why they did this is

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,210
because they knew the future of their

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,670
business was streaming and they needed

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,500
to get rid of the physical DVDs the

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,810
problem was is that the customer base

00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,100
wasn't ready people in the US didn't

00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,290
have the Internet they didn't they

00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,840
couldn't pay for the Internet it was too

00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,880
expensive at that time in 2011 so

00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,310
streaming really wasn't a thing just yet

00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,440
it was a very small group a very small

00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:50,280
part of their user base was interested

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,110
in streaming and it sparked - it sparked

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,240
what what you can go back and look at

00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:56,130
the dear Netflix Twitter trend it was

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,850
like the number one Twitter trend for

00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:02,430
many many months so here here's the

00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,750
thing in October 2011 it was the first

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,690
quarter in which they announced earnings

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:09,650
after the announcement of quickster they

00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:13,500
lost 30% of their stock price and

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:15,390
800,000 subscribers so had huge impact

00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,800
and the reason this happened is because

00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,420
they didn't actually ask their customers

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,450
what they wanted and there's actually an

00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,500
anecdote online in which the CEO talks

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,660
about the fact that he had a

00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,460
conversation with a friend and explained

00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,930
what they were going to be do

00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,130
before they did it and the guy said

00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,630
that's the stupidest thing I ever heard

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,270
you shouldn't do that

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,760
and they did it anyway now the funny

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:36,290
thing about this is in 2012 right after

00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,760
they announced the earnings Netflix

00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:43,099
acquired DVD com

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:45,500
and in 2016 they slowly without telling

00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:47,780
anyone pushed their DVD subscribers over

00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,270
to DVD com and now they're talking about

00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,700
retiring it completely and so if they

00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,260
had just waited a little while they

00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,760
could have done this in a way that would

00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,050
have been acceptable to the years abase

00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,119
and they wouldn't have lost all that

00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:05,300
money okay another example block-post

00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,190
her this would be an example sorry that

00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,869
you got a sneak preview of my next

00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,330
example this is a sneak preview this is

00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:13,609
a this is a company that just didn't pay

00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,140
attention that what was going on so in

00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:17,710
comparison that was going on in Netflix

00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,270
they were trying to push us too too fast

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,460
blockbuster was completely ignoring what

00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,500
people actually wanted they've got two

00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,349
retail stores open in the US now and I

00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,839
think they're gonna close one this year

00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:32,210
who wants to eat watermelon cookies yeah

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,740
so like if they had if they had even

00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,910
asked a customer focus group like if

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,290
they had made these cookies and gave

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,540
them they would have known that this

00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:40,000
wouldn't have worked this is another one

00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,260
like they could have asked their kids

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,760
like this is disgusting could you

00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,740
imagine being on the french-fried line

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,220
outside and getting purple ketchup I

00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,599
don't want purple ketchup like I don't

00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,030
think kids want purple ketchup either

00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,710
and then finally this is the the worst

00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,660
one and I'm gonna be really careful here

00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,820
so these were a product and I hear

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,700
something cuz we know in the US this is

00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:05,000
a product that lays put out in the US

00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:07,400
that used a fad called olestra and they

00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,530
they didn't do product testing they

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,119
didn't give them to humans to say here

00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:13,670
have this chip and let me know what

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,560
happens because if they had done that

00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,420
they would have known that I think was

00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,780
like about 70% of people who ate this

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:23,420
olestra had politely put

00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:26,900
gastrointestinal distress as a result of

00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,790
eating it and so this is an example of I

00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,290
didn't ask my customers they probably

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,849
actually did ask their customers they

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,400
probably said what would you like a

00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:36,109
fat-free potato chip sounds great but

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,550
they did do quality testing so this is

00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:39,940
an example of what happens when you

00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:43,120
don't ship what quality product

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,920
okay so if outcome equals goal then what

00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,440
and so understand and connect the Y with

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,780
your work deliver the outcome with the

00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,400
least amount of outputs that's a really

00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:55,370
important key to this you don't want to

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,220
charm you don't want to say the customer

00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:00,200
needs this one little thing so I'm going

00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,880
to give you a million lines of code to

00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,290
do this thing that is not a good idea

00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,450
and that will give you complete success

00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:14,930
okay so thank you but one last example

00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:27,040
of a product failure so thank you very

00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:27,040
much any questions

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:52,550
it's it's yeah it's a universal yeah its

00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:54,350
universal when you're talking about

00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,310
limits to work in progress you probably

00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:59,810
should have the conversation up and down

00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,540
the other thing with work at work in

00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:04,190
progress limits sometimes it's not

00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,590
possible to limit work in progress

00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:09,410
because you have an executive shouting

00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:12,800
that his laptop is broken so oftentimes

00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:16,100
what teams will do is have a I can only

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,140
have one huge fire going on at a time so

00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,210
I will only take in that one at a time

00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,010
or maybe two it's up to what the team

00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,720
can really accommodate but it's a

00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,340
conversation that you need to have up

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,490
and down the organization so they

00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,920
understand that it's not it's not

00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,750
helpful or healthy to work a little bit

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,430
at the time and all the things because

00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:40,370
you're not actually delivering anything

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:42,860
at that point yeah wrap up oh I'm sorry

00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,890
the question was should work in progress

00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,450
be something that is limited up and down

00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,670
the chain so individual contributors

00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:51,260
managers and also executives should all

00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,200
be included in the conversation and

00:46:51,260 --> 00:47:01,820
should all respect the WIPP limit if you

00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:04,930
would any other questions all right

00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:08,770
thanks everybody for coming

00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,770
