Description: 
	Presentation name: Issues are dead. Long live issues, goals, actions!
Speakers: Fernando Colleone, Adam Šamalík

Description:  Running an open source project but work tracking feels tricky? Is your issue tracker too messy? Come and learn about Agile and a specific approach using issues, goals, and actions to organize and track user feedback, objectives, and work to be done.

We'll also have two specific examples of open source project using this system to organize what they're doing — Fedora Docs and Fedora Modularity.

You'll learn what an Agile mindset is, and about one specific approach you can take.

	00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,170
so hello everyone my name is Fernando

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,110
Colleoni I'm a Aitu practitioner at Red

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,660
Hat and this is Adam Shah Malik a

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:23,159
software engineer at Red Hat and today

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,050
we are going to pretend there's right so

00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:27,949
now we're gonna talk about

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,820
long live issues goals and actions and

00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:37,080
we're gonna show how to be how we could

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:41,670
be agile in the open source environment

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,370
right so this is an agile talk so I'm

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,710
going to start showing you this raise

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,840
your hand if you know or heard about

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:54,330
agile manifesto please

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:57,900
oh so many hands great so I do manifesto

00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:01,050
you raised her hand so do you know what

00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,860
this is number four does it relate to a

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,890
joke manifesto yes or no he doesn't know

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,150
but he knows the agile manifesto and

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:16,770
this twelve so he heard about agile and

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,450
fast and 12 yeah no all right so we

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,250
always talk about the agile manifesto

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,750
and people don't remember or have no

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,920
recollection that the agile manifesto

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,990
was based on four values right and

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,620
twelve principles I'm not going to go

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,630
through them here but it's just

00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,860
important that when we talk about agile

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,760
it always started in 2001 with 17 19

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,130
years that discussed better ways to

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,270
develop software and they came up with

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:56,340
four values and twelve principles and

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:58,400
what is the problem that I see sometimes

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,710
it for example Red Hat

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,500
it's with the word I joke right

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,470
sometimes we say add you to some teams

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,670
it's like oh no not here

00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,069
sometimes we say add you and teams think

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,430
only about scrum right I'd you easy

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,940
scrum oh we are doing spray

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:23,379
and we are and you so the word add you

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:28,540
is like have some interpretations that

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:31,360
are not the best I would say and to me

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,299
as an agile practitioner I would say

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,930
that I don't care so much about really

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:41,590
the word agile scrum we could call I do

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,810
potatoes it's it's fine if we think that

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,879
we are delivering something valuable to

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:50,049
our customers if we think that we are

00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,920
delivering working software right well

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,319
at Red Hat

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,739
you know if we discuss agile scrum

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,319
potatoes people speak up at Red Hat

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,959
a lot right think they give a lot of

00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,690
feedback so they might not like potatoes

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,120
so let's call it Tomatoes I don't care

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:14,470
the thing is we need to stop thinking

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:17,920
about the roles and the things that's

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:22,299
for example scrum say and remember on

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,660
those four values and those twelve

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:30,250
principles and it all comes to you the

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:32,260
mindset right and everyone knows here

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,230
what mindset is real we talk a lot about

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,599
agile mindset Frank but everyone here

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,519
might have a different definition what

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,639
really mindset is and if we google it we

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,290
might find a thousand different

00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:51,299
definitions and you know what I did I

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:55,000
googled it mindset and I found one very

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:57,250
interesting definition that I think it

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,660
makes a lot of sense in the agile world

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:05,949
because and this is a definition from

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,790
psychologists from Stanford University

00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:12,220
and at Caltech and she says mindset are

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,169
just beliefs they are powerful beliefs

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,799
but they're just something in your mind

00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:20,889
and you can change your mind right so I

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:25,870
have cases where some people at Red Hat

00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:28,290
they had the very powerful belief that

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,700
you know scrum

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,860
doesn't work or a Jew is not for us or I

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,320
don't know for this team don't talk

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,000
about retrospectives because they they

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,100
worked with the scrum before it didn't

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,520
work so you need to come up with a

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,070
better name for it perspectives so that

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,230
they don't think that they are doing

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,150
something related to a scrum more agile

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:55,890
so the thing is we have this idea

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,760
mindset and again you have to remember

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:02,520
of the four values and the 12 principles

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,880
which is basically this these are the 12

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,820
principles summarized right which means

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,810
that when you think about being agile

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,820
right satisfy the customer you don't

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:20,220
need a sprint to satisfy the customer

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:23,040
right welcome change it so the way that

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:27,600
you are doing your work either you are

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,580
able to welcome change or not deliver

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,390
frequently it doesn't say that you need

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,190
to deliver every two weeks you have you

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,370
have to define or you can define what

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:41,400
the liver of delivery frickin is so this

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,370
is being and there in the other side is

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,220
what you are doing some agile stuff then

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,640
you have the Sprint retrospective daily

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,430
stand-ups the reviews and all of those

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,160
things that you have seen in scrum or

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,940
Kanban or extreme programming right so

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,130
what is important is that you understand

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,130
this too

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,840
because if you are only doing that only

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,330
doing sprints and new perspectives and

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,830
daily stand-ups but not understanding

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:17,070
where there is coming from then you know

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,470
it will it will be difficult for you to

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:24,270
really deliver something valuable to

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:26,360
your customers or you know to work in

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,560
software that you need to deliver and

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,950
all of this right we talk is would say

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,320
focused on small teams co-located but

00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,290
it's not so much anymore we are in a

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,110
really cool global environment red head

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,500
works on

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:48,630
with the community and Adam here is

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:52,330
gonna show us how his team is working

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:56,560
with you know I think in Fedora with a

00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:02,040
real live example on how he's he and his

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,040
team's trying to really be agile so Adam

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,560
thanks oh hi I'm Adam I'm cold and I

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,360
work on a real team and I have an

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,270
example of how we actually proceed with

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,910
agile and I think the first the most

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,490
important thing was it's a mindset and

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,370
that came from dummy overhang over there

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,530
and that's quite a powerful thought

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,910
right it's not just like sort of rules

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,010
that you have to follow it's not some

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,890
kind of framework it's just it's just

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,980
man said and so we took this and we were

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,640
thinking so how what can we do to

00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,890
actually be agile and we have team in

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,050
Red Hat we work for federal with Fedora

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:48,430
and there are external contributors as

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,440
well so and community contributors are

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,740
usually people they can contribute in

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,270
their spare time and they can just come

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,580
to like every meeting and be just like

00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,860
hundred percent percent and so we need

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,570
to be kind of inclusive so we were

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,740
thinking what's the most important thing

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,980
was the first most important thing we

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,830
have to do and we realize that it's the

00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,350
way we try to work and we kind of came

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,790
up with this so usually if you have an

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,440
open-source project you have like an

00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:17,020
issue tracker with everything and

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,330
there's like buck reports and ideas and

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,000
like everything at once and it can be

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,860
kind of messy so what we saw is that if

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,800
we have these if you break it down its

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,700
into these three sections so its goals

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,160
and you might hear them epic in some

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,470
kind of in the agile scrum or whatever

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,260
and these are basically our goals so we

00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:40,860
say what we want to achieve and this is

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,170
like a strategic view at the project

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,040
then we have actions and these are items

00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:50,710
that take us closer to the goals and

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,360
then we have issues we still keep issues

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,000
but use them from feedback or feedback

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,010
and there can be basically anything

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,780
mess people can do like this doesn't

00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,700
work I have this idea let's discuss this

00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,770
and anything can be there we just go

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,440
through and we somehow make them into

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,710
goals or actions or we discuss them and

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,560
decide what's what's going on so this is

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,630
meant to be like a light demo and I was

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,130
trying to go through and I wasn't really

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,720
lucky with the Wi-Fi so I made

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:20,130
screenshots of the website so it'll be

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,620
funky but we can go through it so the

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,980
first thing we did is this project page

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,380
so it kind of explains how we operate

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,900
and it's like this long so it's not that

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,290
long and we say that our work is tracked

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,530
in Kanban board we have the issue

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,720
tracker so people can just go here and

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:43,110
whatever and we also summarize the goals

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,790
actions feedback how it works then how

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,440
we operate and I really like this

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,910
sentence it says because agile is not

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,670
because it's not making things up as we

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,590
go but it's about to be working toward

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,570
specific goals the first thing that

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,150
needs to exist is to go definitions

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,040
right and this also some pieces like

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,540
criticism I heard from people like

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,250
actually it's just like yeah we have no

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,130
idea what to do so just think different

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,910
things right No Oh have 10 minutes long

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:16,470
um so we talked about how it goes so

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,600
this is like strategic view yes then

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,910
making progress so that's actually how

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,380
we take actions on those cars or

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,450
whatever and how we make it forward and

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,220
how people can report issues so anyone

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,850
can read it and they basically know what

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,210
to do so if I click here on the

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,710
modularity working group Kanban board I

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:39,170
actually get to here and this is taiga

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:42,150
this is open source tracking thing and

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,610
we have this epic view and this is

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,010
basically a prioritized list of goals

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,620
for our team and it's really really long

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,110
we have like I think 30 different goals

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,330
and they always have an owner and it's a

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:58,140
person who somehow drives that forward

00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:00,270
and I can drill down into that into the

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,740
goal and for example I have this content

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,690
discovery and these are some actions I

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,850
can take but this is not the important

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,530
view actually if I open it the most

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,310
important thing is here

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:14,190
so it's why is it required what is it

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:17,190
and definition of done so this is done

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,680
when this this list is this what's kind

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,380
of nice about this is that even I don't

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,080
have to know what I need to do in order

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:28,320
to get there I just need to know where

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,570
to get and then I'll scroll a little bit

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,370
down and I have some actions defined

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,350
here and this is not like hundred

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,020
percent coverage for example I have no

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,700
idea how to do something so I have this

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,890
word spike which means like a research

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,590
project so I just have a question like

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,700
can I do this and this and as you can

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,740
see it's assigned to me and it's in

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,590
progress when I figure it out I can make

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,390
another cards and this is also nice when

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,770
people come to the project I have no

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,620
idea what to do about how to contribute

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,750
they can actually even find one epic

00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,880
that will just describe what needs to be

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,890
done and even they can think about

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,490
things that needs to be done so that's

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:08,340
quite that's quite powerful mechanism so

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,830
I don't know what this means

00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,140
oh yeah that just opened one of the

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,480
cards and this is like again description

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,670
what I need to do and again acceptance

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,520
criteria AC definition of the amanda

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,040
card is done um so this was the

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,780
strategic overview and this is when we

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,970
prioritize we have like a meeting every

00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,770
week and we try to prioritize discuss

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,640
what we need to achieve and then we when

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:34,350
we work actually we go to this view so

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,820
this is the Kanban view and these are

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,890
the actions so it's none of the goals

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,440
these are the actions and I can actually

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,690
just come this is no one so I can just

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,400
assign to myself move it into progress

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,260
and start working on it and this is

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,350
super important communication tool for

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,020
people in distributed teams or people in

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:57,480
the community so we actually see what's

00:12:52,020 --> 00:13:00,240
happening right now all right I went

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,520
back to the website and I can also show

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,200
the issue tracker which is like a

00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,300
standard issue tracker and just like

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,220
yeah please make clear bla bla bla this

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,920
is wrong and just let's discuss this so

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,620
it's unstructured input that we can work

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,180
with but it's not it doesn't tell you

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,440
anything about the project that's why we

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,650
have the board and that's why we use the

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,460
hughes tiger

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,110
so goals for girls actions the gas goes

00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:31,650
to the goals and then issues for

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:35,050
feedback ideas and input we have so I

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:39,310
think that's all we have now um I don't

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,170
know how many how much time is left we

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,080
have time all right so let's just finish

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:47,710
with the slide agile is mindset it's not

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,050
a set of rules and just have the mindset

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,060
and just try to think about what work

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,810
for you the best and do whatever you

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,990
want actually just have a mindset that's

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:04,030
all any questions or yeah I do have a

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:06,820
question for you so yeah so this is you

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,370
see that this is like open source when

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:13,120
we think about agile we tend to think

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:15,370
about you know teams co-located or

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,580
distributed but maybe the same company

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:26,500
so what is interesting in in this is

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:29,590
that anyone here could go take a card to

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:34,500
work and help this team so how they

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:36,610
really how can someone who get engaged

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,920
that's a very good question so I would

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,630
so if you want to contribute to our

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,840
project you can get to the documentation

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,450
which is somewhere here so just Google

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,920
for our modularity and that will be one

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,230
of the first links and we just click on

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,690
community and I don't think I have the

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,580
screenshot here but if you click here

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,950
you would see an IRC channel you can

00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,350
reach out to us you would see a mailing

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,210
list you can write us and just get in

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,860
touch or submit an issue actually you

00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,810
can submit an issue with an idea and say

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,540
you want to work on it and then we can

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,400
add you to the Kanban board and what's

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,990
the difference also between the Kanban

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,730
one and the issue tracker anyone can

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,310
submit anything into the issue tracker

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,780
but the Kanban board is just for the

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:21,700
team so we somehow distinguish between

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,770
what the team does and then what are the

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,580
issues and whatever four different

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:29,830
components so yeah just reach out and we

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,350
can you can we can add you to the board

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,660
you can have a goal you can own a card

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,320
or an epic

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,970
make progress I think that's fine thank

00:15:37,320 --> 00:16:01,590
you you're welcome

00:15:38,970 --> 00:16:03,540
any other questions yeah so the question

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,030
was if we use ending other issue

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,980
trackers like for subprojects did I get

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,450
it right yeah so all right I'll try the

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,150
Wi-Fi let's see what's gonna happen

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,790
because I don't have that here but for

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:19,470
example I have a I have one epic here

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,720
that is DN f-distribution upgrades with

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,120
modules and it's not showing because I'm

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:30,540
not mirroring my screen which is amazing

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:33,110
all right there we go okay so again I go

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,580
to the epics and I have one here and

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,330
this means something to some people but

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:42,600
I have the description I have everything

00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:45,060
and what's great about this I can put

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,550
comments on the gold level or I can put

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,950
comments on the issue level so I can

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,780
either like put a comment here that we

00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,760
need to fix something or this it's

00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,140
relevant to other project and I can use

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,420
that you should record I for example

00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,100
have like a card here so waiting for

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,770
word had Bugzilla bla bla bla ain't get

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,000
implemented and that's how I can somehow

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,000
they link to things and

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,189
oh so if I have to take the work

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,069
manually input it again not necessarily

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:22,679
so this was just one issue so I just

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,929
like in copy and for example track but I

00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,089
think what's great about this if I have

00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:29,880
an epoch it's the goal I can just say in

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:32,010
the epoch hey this work is tracked here

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,830
for example in this issue with this tag

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,000
or whatever and I think the most

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,220
important thing is that we have

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,840
centralized place for the strategy view

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:56,190
but we can then link to other places and

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:57,809
I think that works quite well so this

00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,520
makes sense for things that you are like

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,809
you have some idea you define it to

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,429
finer grain details and then you realize

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:06,899
that some you know DNF has to implement

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,909
something so we created bugzilla for it

00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:11,159
and so on and so on but I'm wondering

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:13,350
like if any of your products you know

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,029
has is getting customer feedback or

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,010
users feedback through bugzilla or

00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,630
through you know github issues and how

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,110
you incorporate that to your work like

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,250
your maintenance work basically I

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,610
finally got it I'm not slow I'm just

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,110
taking time so the issue tracker I

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,000
showed you it was like a general issue

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,679
tracker if people know where to actually

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
contribute we can have it's like we

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,279
treat it as an inbox and we can have

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,899
multiple inboxes so if we know that we

00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,120
need to follow this other tracker for a

00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,940
feedback we normally would people can

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,740
also just like email or write on IRC and

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,740
I think it treats the kind of similar

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:57,200
it's just like whatever place people can

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:57,200
give a simple so yeah that works yeah

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,000
so the question was if we turn issues

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:14,250
into epics so it depends right if the

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,510
issue is about some something that we

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,030
like a proposal that we need to

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,790
implement and we as a team decide yeah

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,350
that's a goal we can make an epic it can

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,450
be about something small and it's just

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,820
we card in one of the existing epics or

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,820
we can just have a discussion and then

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,590
close it so clarify so that's not like a

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,930
rule that issue needs to become an ethic

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,730
it's just yeah it's just an input and

00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,710
definitely can become an epic and then

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:50,730
we close the issue and say hey it's

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:52,560
right here as I go and your question if

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,880
we have a car if if cars that don't

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,620
belong to any epic definitely um so not

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,410
everything can be made into an epic for

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,490
example I just realized that if I open

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:08,160
this communication page it lies we don't

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,870
have this meeting anymore so if I want

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,180
to remember this I can just create a car

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,530
don't put it in an epic because that's

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,940
not like a huge goal for the team I just

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,650
like it shows up on the boards can

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,520
someone can pick it up completely close

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,310
it and we're done

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,170
so definitely we have cars outside of

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,170
epics yeah

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:41,430
right yeah mm-hmm

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,480
so good question so the question was um

00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:47,730
well most fish that um if the if all the

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,250
cars are organized into epochs it'll be

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,130
like less chaotic right but it really

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,980
depends so it we need to think about

00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,190
what we use the epics for so we use the

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,350
epics for full extra logic view and

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,300
prioritizing and also communicating with

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,760
others this is our team priorities and

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,070
this is what we're gonna do so they need

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,030
to be like closeable right like this is

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,250
what I want to achieve and they just

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,930
closed the epic if I have an epic just

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,480
like general issues I think that would

00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:19,350
be that would make sense

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,330
but also if I have like just a car to do

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,740
something I don't need it need to see it

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,090
in the strategy view I just like have it

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,220
on the board and it's actually just an

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,080
action item someone can take and do so

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,930
but it really depends on your team like

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,300
it to us it works nicely maybe for your

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:39,000
team it wouldn't that's its mindset it's

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:40,620
not a set of rules yeah we have question

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
for Fernando because he's the expert I'm

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:52,350
just a software engineer I'm making this

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:57,510
up I'm lying to you basically any other

00:21:52,350 --> 00:22:00,770
questions for joke's on Fernando all

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,770
right so thank you for coming

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,970
