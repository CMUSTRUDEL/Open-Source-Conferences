Title: Processes & Tools over Individuals & Interactions
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: Processes & Tools over Individuals & Interactions
Speakers: Fernando Colleone, Pavel Najman

Description:  Agile nowadays might mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. You might ask 10 times what it is, and get 10 different answers. Because of that, enabling teams to be more agile becomes even more difficult. Different perceptions, different problems and lack of understanding what really Agile is significantly contribute to misconceptions.

When thinking about Agile, some people think about : “too many meetings”, “micromanagement”, “too complex”, “not flexible enough” or ”not having the opportunity to fail”. Plus, it is impossible with remote employees. 
Not only because of these perceptions, Agile gets bad reputation.

In this talk we want to share our view of what Agile is and what Agile is not based on our experience working with several teams at Red Hat.

okay so hello everyone thank you for

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,160
coming staying a little bit longer for

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,990
us

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,720
my name is pavani Minh this is Fernando

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,600
: we are both agile partitions in Red

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,939
Hat and today we are going to speak

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,519
about why processes are much more

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,730
important than people and you may ask

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,980
why we think that we think that because

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,930
it's one of the values of our manifesto

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,620
you see right or oh it's actually other

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,680
way around

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,150
of course it's other way around it's

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,730
individuals and interactions over

00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,530
processes and tools and don't get us

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,840
wrong we don't think that the processes

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,610
are not important of course every

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,980
project or work needs are processes

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,130
definition of dance go budget and cetera

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,490
etc but we should not forget that the

00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,280
people are delivering the product people

00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,230
are defining the scope the definition of

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,810
done people are using the tools and

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,030
infrastructure and people are defining

00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,720
the very processes we are using every

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,880
day so only if you develop if you focus

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,490
on developing teams and individuals and

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,130
you are paying interactions paying

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,150
paying attention to interactions we are

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,659
having every day

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,590
then this makes you set up the project

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,470
for success much better but sometimes we

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:33,630
don't do that sometimes as if we forgot

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,310
that individuals are over processes and

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,970
sometimes we don't do that because it's

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,870
not easy people are complex and

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,930
sometimes the interactions are not

00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,869
comfortable so we are avoiding this but

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,110
luckily we have the agile manifesto who

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,150
helps us remind us that individuals

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,240
interactions are over processes and

00:01:51,150 --> 00:02:00,299
tools it was already mentioned in the

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,119
finals first presentation that the scrum

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,460
and agile manifesto sometimes are used

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,740
interchangeably but obviously it's not

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,170
true the manifest of agile software

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,300
development speaks about values and

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,330
principles and the people who wrote it

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,770
and sign it belief that when you follow

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,870
the principles and even

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,840
you live the values that is the better

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,420
way how to deliver software on the other

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,690
hand we have a frameworks like scrum and

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,720
Kanban or XP and is our system with

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,330
specific rules and rules which helps us

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,730
create environment in which we can live

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,700
the values and practice the principles

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,040
easier but they are not the same thing

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,380
obviously roles and rules are not the

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,900
same as values and principles and we

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,990
should keep that in mind so the

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,370
implication of this is that you can

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,410
leave a value of values without actually

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,240
using any specific rules so there are

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,550
teams which are not using scrum or

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,410
Kanban or any things particular but they

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,920
can still pursue the agile software

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,470
development unfortunately it can be true

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,300
also other way around you can follow

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,250
order rules of any specific framework

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,860
but you can still do not leaving a value

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,200
right you can have all the retrospection

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,620
all the ceremonies but if you don't

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,060
understand what they are for you are not

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:31,230
pursuing the agile software development

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:33,300
anyway very descriptive slide so there

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,850
are two typical mistakes we are doing

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,670
with this pursue of agile software

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,910
development so first we tend to impose

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,030
the frameworks on teams and the second

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,880
we impose that without giving them

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,370
support so they understand how they use

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:55,050
it and then if statute things happens

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,390
the framework is only administration for

00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,959
the tomb for the team and it's perceived

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:04,770
as as something additional right and

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:09,870
it's got a bad reputation and then your

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:12,180
team fails and we're going to blame the

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,330
framework obviously and it makes sense

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,459
because the framework is the thing which

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:22,200
brought us all the meetings on the rules

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:25,110
and on the roles we do not understand so

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,900
when we impose a framework on a team

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,510
without additional support it's very

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,430
likely that the framework the

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,160
change we brought will get the bad

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,840
reputation and of course I can ask I

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,660
mean while you're blaming the framework

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,960
the framework is only a tool you choose

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,930
the tool but do not forget that

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
unfortunately sometimes the people are

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,070
not the one who choose the tool someone

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,020
choose the tool for them and didn't give

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,890
them in an additional support to

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,810
understand how to use the tool and

00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:01,020
Fernando is going to speak about are the

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,100
consequences of this so we work with a

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:10,530
lot of people at Red Hat and we talked a

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:13,250
lot to them about agile and it's very

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,800
interesting that they always have some

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:20,580
complaints or know some not-so-nice

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,740
feedback about it and I will show here

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,220
some typical things that they say about

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:29,730
scrum about agile in general and I will

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,880
go quickly on maybe what's behind on on

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,370
those things or those complaints so the

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,500
first one is from from software

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,890
engineers in general the Red Hat that

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,140
piece talked about too is that we have

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,450
too many meetings right they are saying

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,570
we have too many meetings or you know

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,030
the the meetings are just too long why

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,640
scrum is telling us you know we'll have

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,820
planning's and retrospectives and a

00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:00,000
listen why why we have so many meetings

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,930
but the fact is that if a team is doing

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,990
working with scrum for example if they

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,120
are working in a two-week sprint they

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,720
should be spending around I don't know

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,560
two weeks 40 hours a week 80 hours they

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:22,290
should be being these scrum meetings for

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:26,280
seven hours eight hours so 10% if they

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:28,590
are having these more meetings then the

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,290
problem is not with scrum this is not

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,470
with the meetings or the things that

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,240
scrum saying that they they should do

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:39,960
Mabley maybe the problem is elsewhere me

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,930
but the problem is with that very messy

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,289
product backlog maybe the problem is the

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,809
tea

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,309
does not know why they are doing the

00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,059
things that they are doing they don't

00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:50,909
know the goal

00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:53,699
so it's elsewhere so this is one of the

00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:56,129
things that one of the software in

00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,659
software engineers tend to talk about

00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:03,779
when we are working with scrum

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:05,969
specifically the other thing that some

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:10,409
of the software engineers thing is like

00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:13,949
micromanagement right it's like you are

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:16,369
always asking for things but don't

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:20,099
confuse micromanagement with

00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:24,930
transparency right when we want everyone

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:29,490
to talk to each other show the results

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:32,639
and when we have the scrum meetings the

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,919
scrum ceremonies it's not for the scrum

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,219
master it's not for the product owner

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:41,129
right it's really for the team to

00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:45,059
communicate and understand where they

00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:47,399
are right for my team's when I don't

00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:50,759
know sometimes I don't go to a daily

00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,159
stand up and they say you you didn't go

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,430
I said yeah I don't need you did you go

00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,879
yes I don't need to be there I need just

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,649
make sure that the team is having those

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,569
stand-ups and communicating with out to

00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:07,199
each other so that's another thing that

00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:09,659
they say another thing is that all of

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,719
this is too complex for me oh my god I

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,769
just want to code right living the dream

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,110
right

00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:18,149
I just want to code I don't want to

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:22,139
think about value I don't want to think

00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:24,539
about you know other things I don't want

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,680
to oh my god talk to other people I

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,979
don't want this

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,860
I just want to code and this environment

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:36,620
seems to be so complex and you know what

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:43,199
the agile software environment agile is

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:45,839
more its health care in in the complex

00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:47,970
environment right it works best in a

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,459
complex environment and software

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,670
development is a complex environment so

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:56,460
you know these are the things that

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,830
software engineers would have to

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:03,029
to deal with you are in a very complex

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:05,190
environment the other thing it's a kind

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,990
of complaint is that frameworks and

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,860
methodologies are not flexible enough

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:14,070
right so you think about scrum oh my god

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,700
15 minutes stand up if you have a two

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,540
weeks brain everything is time boxed but

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,790
the thing is is that with this

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,279
frameworks with these methodologies what

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,740
you're getting is you're getting the

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,430
short feedback cycle if you were here in

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,750
previous sessions you saw we're talking

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,149
about it other people talked about it

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,940
because it's very important right the

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:41,550
short feedback cycle is very important

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,570
so you have the time box because it also

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:49,140
gives brings consistency to what you are

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,089
doing and if it brings consistency in

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,810
the longer term will reduce the

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:57,000
complexity of what you're doing the next

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:02,209
one is like we don't have the

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,430
opportunity to fail at all and well

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:08,400
that's right right you don't have the

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:11,160
opportunity to fail if you fail we the

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,029
scrum police we're gonna get you and you

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,830
are in big trouble

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:21,000
no that's not the case in fact you can

00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:24,300
fail and if you fail it just should

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,730
learn young it's not here yeah there was

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,190
a great talk this morning about product

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:33,630
owner and he mentioned this it's okay to

00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:35,550
fail right if you learn something and as

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,260
I just mentioned you have the short

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:44,430
feedback cycle right so if you fail you

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:47,160
can learn and recover fast maybe in a

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,920
two-week sprint three week sprint and

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,680
not in a two-year cycle when you are

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,089
just delivering your product right and

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,899
the last one is that it doesn't work

00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:00,990
with distributed teams well we have

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:04,950
challenges yes time zones no lack of

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,230
personal relationships but we are in a

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,029
global environment and it really it can

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,149
work and

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:16,389
it is and there are ways to to make it

00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:18,939
happen so you know these are the

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:21,309
complaints that some of the complaints

00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:24,579
that we seen and we talked to people

00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:28,179
about and the thing is is that we need

00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:30,519
we as I do practitioners we need to work

00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:32,619
with the people with the teams to let

00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,579
them to find their own way how to be

00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:38,739
agile right so not as Paco said we are

00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:42,699
not imposing anything you're just

00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:46,179
working with them to make them better so

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:49,239
they are defining on their way how to be

00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:52,569
agile and always with those twelve

00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:53,290
principles in mind right to satisfy the

00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:56,079
customer

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,089
you don't need scrum you just need to

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,499
have in your mind that what you want to

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,569
do when you're doing whatever that you

00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:05,230
are doing that you are satisfying

00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:07,779
someone or it's your customer so let

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,179
them work in their own way to be how to

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:14,559
be agile but always keeping this in mind

00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:16,869
and I have an example this is one of my

00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,329
teams they are working with scram

00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:22,029
they are working in two-week sprints

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:25,179
they have their reveals they have their

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:27,429
retrospectives but when I joined you

00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:31,779
know the first planning meeting that I

00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:33,459
went there to experience I think they

00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,660
were in the room for five hours

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:39,309
right five hours they'll remember it's

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,839
like the morning and the afternoon and

00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:43,089
what was the problem there it was not

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,100
that the scrum meeting the planning

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:49,119
meaning that this scrum was the problem

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:52,889
it was because the the backlog was not

00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:55,990
prioritize or they didn't have any goals

00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,600
to achieve and so it's just long

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:02,709
discussions about nothing that is

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,499
related to the planning right so and we

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:09,879
I to practitioners we work with them and

00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:11,949
we try to see these problems and with

00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:15,489
incremental changes we try to improve

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:17,650
them and now paavo is going to talk

00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:23,980
about one of his things

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:26,290
okay okay so another team from axe from

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,089
my experience so they don't use any

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,330
specific framework it's like combination

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,130
of everything they heard I think and but

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,420
they have kind of a monthly planning we

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,130
can say this and I have a weekly

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,870
synchronization meeting when they check

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,839
regularly when they are on the track

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,370
with the plan and one day that they

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,620
thought that maybe this weekly meeting

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,520
is is too much you know it's a one-hour

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,690
for everyone very difficult conversation

00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,580
and maybe it's not fragmented enough

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,490
maybe we would like to have two meetings

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,770
half an hour of age during the week and

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,410
we have a discussion and we came to the

00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,570
conclusion then we have I have no idea

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,960
what's better because we couldn't

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:07,540
foresee all the implications which it

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,100
might have so we made experiment we try

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,510
it for a month and after a month we came

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,820
together again and decided whether it

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,430
works for us or not the decision was

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,270
that it doesn't work so we went back for

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,880
the one we committing what we are trying

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,089
to say is that we are borrowing this

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,040
stuff from Stuart so thank you Stuart

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,290
so you should pursue incremental

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,660
improvements what does it mean that you

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,420
should always strive to be better but

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,560
only small steps do not change

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,560
everything at once

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,390
because then you will first go right in

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,490
the heels and the second you will have

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,490
no idea which change brought you to

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,940
benefit and which change make situation

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,770
worse

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:53,380
and yes please experiment you have to

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,150
admit that you are not going always to

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,360
see all the implications of a change you

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,850
are proposing so it's always safe to try

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,400
for some time days weeks months

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,400
depending on the change and revert back

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,100
if that doesn't make sense make your own

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,890
way how to achieve what you want to

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,010
achieve and the last thing is please

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,870
revisit if what you do currently still

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,360
make sense because sometimes we forget

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,580
that the environment around us changes

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
and the people are changes but we are

00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,709
still keeping doing the same thing over

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,140
and over again because we always did it

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:31,990
so revisit what you did what you do

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,380
whether it still applies for this

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:38,279
and the last thing before the end a gel

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:41,170
has no brain so please use your own and

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:44,740
keep in mind that the frameworks are not

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,509
here to solve the problems for you they

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:51,250
are here only to make the problems more

00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:53,470
visible so that you can solve it ok not

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,660
every time it's comfortable thing you

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,660
know not it's not easy to look at

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,970
ourselves and see our priorities are

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,329
unclear our scope is unclear we don't

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,899
have no vision but otherwise how else we

00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:10,060
are going to improve and so this is are

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:13,449
the key takeaways from the presentation

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:17,560
if you forget already so you can live

00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:19,540
values without any specific rules let

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,230
people define their own way how to

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,920
pursue agile software development pursue

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,839
incremental improvement experiment and

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,250
revisit if the practice you are using

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:36,029
style makes sense for you now thank you

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,029
thank you thank you

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:42,690
[Applause]

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:12,030
for a team that has no basically any

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,490
kind of framework what would you suggest

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,490
where would you suggest to start with

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,110
because you said to do something

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,110
incrementally so where to start from

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:30,570
so if you want to pursue agile software

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,580
development start for example with the

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,230
principles start with the values and

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,860
take a look at what you are doing now

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:40,230
whether it's reflects there or not and

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,690
if you have some stuff which you think

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:47,310
down reflect there pick one and try to

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,650
change stuff and that's all important is

00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,930
to have the discussion about it with

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,990
your team so that you have to buy in

00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,910
from the team then they would like to

00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,290
experiment especially if you are new and

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,420
you don't have any you know agile

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,040
practitioner or anything most likely you

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,070
are going to make some bad choices but

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,650
that's normal but you just still need to

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:13,190
try to make things different so that you

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,190
see what fits for you ok it was helpful

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:29,150
okay so thank you again and

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,150
