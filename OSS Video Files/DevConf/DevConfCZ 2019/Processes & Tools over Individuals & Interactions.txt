	Presentation name: Processes & Tools over Individuals & Interactions
Speakers: Fernando Colleone, Pavel Najman

Description:  Agile nowadays might mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. You might ask 10 times what it is, and get 10 different answers. Because of that, enabling teams to be more agile becomes even more difficult. Different perceptions, different problems and lack of understanding what really Agile is significantly contribute to misconceptions.

When thinking about Agile, some people think about : “too many meetings”, “micromanagement”, “too complex”, “not flexible enough” or ”not having the opportunity to fail”. Plus, it is impossible with remote employees. 
Not only because of these perceptions, Agile gets bad reputation.

In this talk we want to share our view of what Agile is and what Agile is not based on our experience working with several teams at Red Hat.
