Title: Make system administration boring again
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: Make system administration boring again
Speakers: Pavel Cahyna, Till Maas
Description:  APIs strive to make programmer's jobs easier by keeping stability. Less attention is perhaps being paid to stability of system configuration, where interfaces include configuration file formats and various utilities. Ansible is a great tool for system management, but keeping Ansible playbooks across major upgrades can be challenging due to those interface differences. Come to learn how we are solving this problem using standardized Ansible roles - Linux System Roles.

Attendees will gain a practical understanding of how to use Linux System Roles with Ansible to configure their Fedora, RHEL or CentOS systems consistently across multiple releases. The audience is assumed to have a basic understanding of Ansible and experience with Linux (preferably Fedora-derived) system administration.

	00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:12,530
good morning I'm Pavel Tina and the lead

00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,539
developer of the nuke systems project

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,770
that I've had and my clique the mass

00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,830
will join me later in the presentation

00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:22,460
to show you some some examples so make

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:26,510
system administration Boeing again why

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,820
why Boeing actually what I said just the

00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,760
Chinese they're supposed to be at least

00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,309
the Chinese curse may you live in

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,440
interesting times which tells us that

00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,050
may be interesting is not always a good

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,600
thing and what can make system

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,730
administrators life interesting in not

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,220
so positive sense well done obviously

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,090
many things but I will focus on one one

00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:52,310
in this block and this is changes in

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,760
system interfaces because the

00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,070
administrators interfaces are in general

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,329
less stable than for instance api's and

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,420
if you are going to various UNIX systems

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,710
or even the new distributions or even

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,299
say different versions of the same

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,780
radius distribution you will find out

00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:14,330
that you have quite similar user user

00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,640
experience we have just mostly the same

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,260
applications we behave mostly the same

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,360
way but on the other hand the

00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,380
administrator experience will be very

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,790
different and this of course has

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:29,229
negative impact on the administrator's

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,490
life because even when we upgrade from

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,040
one major version to another major

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,470
version of the Sinister our automation

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,570
like shot schedule break and our habits

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,030
will be no longer around

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:46,220
in general it makes our work force

00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,090
sometimes not in so every crosswise like

00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:53,830
in this example

00:01:47,090 --> 00:02:00,520
so in general we believe that linux it's

00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:03,110
simple simple management and because

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,900
it's perceived by the administrators

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:09,319
that linux is too hard to the managed

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,599
environment obama

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,579
instability of interfaces I heard it in

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,950
the previous slide

00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:18,319
and also obviously we need automated

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,000
management before this we have we have

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,609
configuration management tools like I

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,230
constable I do by if you are interesting

00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:29,590
more in the interactive experience and

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,510
less into automatic by automation

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,640
there's a tool called patent there was

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,989
designation just just before me about

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,969
about the carpet object

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:44,269
anyway how can this automated management

00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:48,680
systems help with interface evolution

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:51,769
Tobin I believe it's a great way to

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,209
address this problem because in in an

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:58,010
sabalan you declare system state the

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,590
desired system state instead of lighting

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,109
shell shell skills you delight in using

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,510
PI books but this is just a beginner of

00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:08,090
course because the PI books can break if

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:15,709
this interface is change just as this

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:18,229
the shops can do so how to address this

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,530
this program again ansible provides all

00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:22,879
these some some mechanisms and for

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,629
instance ansible

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,669
has some modules actual action plugins

00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:31,940
which can abstract away the differences

00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:34,819
like the package module can abstract the

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,840
differences among the actual package

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:40,370
management implementations like young up

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,299
there is a service module which suffered

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:48,680
abstraction above systems like system D

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:52,010
up status system for any skips those are

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,169
very very targeted by targeted modules

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,659
by purpose because models in possible

00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:00,819
are targeted to one specific one

00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,819
specific case and for more general

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,790
marginal cases for more extensive

00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:12,830
systems in ansible we have those so we

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,720
decided to address above using use

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:20,500
and simple house and we created the

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,900
project called a Linux system rolls in

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,480
rail we called our system house which is

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,090
a collection of unstable holes which

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,530
provide stable and consistent

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,480
configuration interface to support to

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,570
support it a version of operating

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,560
systems which now include health

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:42,560
centerÃ­s and federal and they are

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,920
designed to manage various subsystems of

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,840
those operating systems and with a

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,810
consistent experience intensity of light

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,780
once the pie book and it were a know

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,960
against multiple versions and subsystems

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,830
that we manage are now time

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,370
synchronization

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:03,740
kadam network postfix and phoenix we

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,890
have a better version office storage all

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,620
and we have logging in kogas in future

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:15,290
we made it at the house like 500

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:17,840
management so how we do it actually some

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,850
in some cases the interfaces don't

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,810
evolve so much like in the case of

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:28,100
Scylla nukes and they maybe just changes

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:31,220
in the names of packages so well this is

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,570
quite easy to to handle but in some

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,770
cases we have more drastic changes and

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,020
for this we have the concept of

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,120
providers providers are different

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,470
implementations of the same of the same

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,630
functionality for instance for time

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,110
synchronization for the NTP protocol we

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:56,120
have two implementations ntpd and chrony

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:58,460
and in well we have heist and TP d by

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,710
Connie and of course this means that the

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,320
configuration file formats and the name

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,320
of the utility is not now I've changed

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,150
and this is a perfect example how we can

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,400
handle this this change so we have a

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:16,430
time signal which we just to providers

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:18,290
and TP other similar cases network

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,700
configuration because in all the

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,750
relations of Tyrell a fedora

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,270
we had escaped systems were

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:31,340
configuration files were located in EDC

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:34,220
and edited directly in newer versions we

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,669
have network manager again to two

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,259
providers for the network in the case of

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:41,120
logging we have just our sis what

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,520
collided but there are multiple organ

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,979
beam also we may add support for free

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,660
and if just interest for instance and

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:52,220
the point of those colitis is that

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,710
different varieties of the same role

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,520
have as a common interface or at least a

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,729
common common subset of functionality it

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,409
means that you write a play book using

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,830
this common interface it you don't have

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:08,389
to worry

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:10,370
which rider is actually being used the

00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,580
role chooses the activate provided for

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,970
the given operating system version so

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:21,610
now some examples some simple examples

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:24,289
now selling honks let's say you need to

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,259
configure some settings boolean's and

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:29,569
some scenic spots so those are the

00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:33,530
variables for the Sevenoaks world to do

00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:38,000
this and then you execute the selling

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:41,719
external to configuration variables for

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,960
one for boolean's one for parts settings

00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:46,639
boring spurge parts approach if the add

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,770
and all this means that those

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,820
modifications are a bite on top of

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:54,169
existing new modifications and if the if

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,969
the yes

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,110
this means that previous modifications

00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:01,430
would be dropped and only those

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,199
modifications would then exist on the

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,710
system so you would return to a clean

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:11,509
state and abide by those this is

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:15,199
actually quite important point so in

00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:18,319
case we said courage now we declare just

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,090
changes to the system and if yes we

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,750
declare the complete state in our Bible

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,759
while the purge variables are default to

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:29,120
know what would happen if they were

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,840
defer to yes let's imagine for the sake

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,419
of example that we want to configure

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,430
serving house using somebody like a pie

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:43,700
book in the pie book we need to switch

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:46,279
some select bullying on so we put it in

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,380
my book we execute sign up stall and

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,230
then we want to serve some tiles of NFS

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:54,380
so again we writer by good for NFS

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,130
configuration we switch some salient

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:01,310
going on in this in this pie book and if

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,010
we have the 30s in those PI books and we

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,620
applied to play books again the same

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,710
host which is not an unlikely scenario

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,130
that we would use NFS and somehow on the

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,900
same file server we would just in the

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,150
second try book collaborative

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,050
modifications in the first by book which

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:29,000
is what we don't want so the spy this is

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:36,080
defaulting to now this was a very simple

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,630
example and we have done much more

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,000
sophisticated over network configuration

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,520
and I will invite my colleague Tomas

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,230
with the maintainer of the network hole

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,440
which is almost most complex all

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,830
actually you will show you some example

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,800
and some demo thank you very much puppet

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,050
so this is just an example of the

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,440
configuration for the network world and

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,240
there it happens in the one very

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,700
variable called network connection and

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,520
the important thing here is that instead

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,330
of configuring the interface

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,760
configuration

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,589
it's about configuring connection

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,380
profile so this could mean for example

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:19,280
in the beginning there's the connection

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:24,290
eth0 and there's just a name and then it

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:26,089
defaults to using the interface name the

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,550
same as the connection interface but for

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:30,050
example in this case the profile is

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,880
called we're pointing a and then you

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,390
have to specify what's the interface

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,390
name and this makes it more powerful to

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,630
configure several possibilities and also

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:44,420
one other important thing is that it

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,860
abstracts the one-time stage resists the

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,380
persistent state so this means

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,329
you can specify whether or not the

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,160
connection profile is active

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,110
individually from whether or not it's on

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,529
disk so for example if you would like to

00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:00,200
remove a profile from your system it

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:02,360
might be that you still need it up until

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,630
you want to reboot and then reboot in a

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,850
clean new configuration therefore you

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,680
might not want the profile to go down

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,500
when you just remove this and there's

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,079
something that it's only possible if you

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,200
have more than one state because you

00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:21,740
cannot express all these combinations

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,510
and the wall itself it supports all the

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,329
important configuration options

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:30,740
so of course Ethernet interfaces with IP

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:34,100
configuration dhcp thetac and network

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,260
set in s settings and of course virtual

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,329
interface types like bonding bill and

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,810
Butch's and there's also support for

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,970
InfiniBand and vic make vignette and

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,550
you're probably wondering what this

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,700
actually configure so that's the next

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,699
step I will show you what will happen

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,529
when I apply this configuration so all

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:59,000
the important thing is it works on all

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,750
values at the same time it would be

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,209
currently six seven and eight beta and

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,910
the idea here is to configure DHCP on

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,980
eth0 two for example as a management

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,199
interface and at the same time have a

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,949
bond interface called the bond which is

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:18,050
used for the application and then for

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:20,810
the bond we also need to specify which

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,149
members are part and that's a th1 and

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,890
th2 and the configuration is basically

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,610
the same except for the interface name

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:32,839
and another possibility that the network

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,730
world provides is to ensure that the

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,550
only the configuration that you specify

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,959
in your plate is the configuration

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,560
that's on the system so you can really

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,940
rely on having the whole network

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,810
configuration in your configuration

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,800
management system when the system still

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:55,250
works after you apply this role and as

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,110
the last item in the list persistent

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,450
state absent so it doesn't state the

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,790
name for the connection profile

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,950
why's that just everything else that's

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:13,430
not specified will be removed and now I

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:18,020
will show you a short to live demo so

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:27,530
this is now a fedora host with these

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:29,870
system was installed I will just work on

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:34,450
this playbook and then it will run on

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,450
all three machines we're at 6 7 & 8

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,840
figure out what it needs to do because

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,450
for example device 6 system uses inner

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,660
script so back end and the other systems

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,780
network manager and replies at the end

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:55,010
we see all the three systems we applied

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,650
successfully and for example you can

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:01,850
also see that it used init scripts for

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:05,810
OS 6 and network manager for 7 to 8 and

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:10,190
you can just take a quick look someone

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:12,050
the way 7 machine and see that the

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,390
weapon was created successfully with

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:19,610
both slave interfaces now I will head it

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,290
over back to Pavel who will show us the

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,150
challenges that we experienced and that

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,080
might our life interesting so your life

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,080
can be more boring

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:39,660
Thank You dill and some changes have we

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,600
encountered so you may ask whether we

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:46,020
are not just creating another standard

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:52,350
to add to the audio listing a long list

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:55,010
of standard the infamous 15 standard to

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,810
some extent this is of course true but

00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,270
when we are adding answer by automation

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:04,230
we are always doing this side we we

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:07,200
always specify some some variables to

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,510
also apply books which are kind of a new

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,790
standard so it's a great opportunity to

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,700
actually create a more abstract standard

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,800
which will which will cover more

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,600
versions of operating systems and shield

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,800
us from from the from the changes

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:28,350
there's a more serious challenge though

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,300
for instance the postfix so we may have

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,700
noticed that we have a posting so and

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,000
you may have asked why why postings and

00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,490
why don't you mail because it would make

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,610
great sense to have email all with

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:45,300
multiple trials like post race and and

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,610
send mail maybe even exam or Kumail and

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,089
we were thinking about this but we we

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:57,240
found out that just the concepts are too

00:15:51,089 --> 00:16:00,300
different and it's it would be hard to

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,760
do just email which which would have

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,440
like sometimes that concept of routing

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,620
translate to the postfix source and mail

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,900
to my concert so in some cases it is

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,610
just not practical

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,990
no not practical to do an abstraction

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:20,820
because the underlying systems to while

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:23,839
the divergent so of course just always

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,480
limitation to this to this approach

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,580
another change was the granularity of of

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,790
changes I explained in the synapse

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,560
example that we have the ability to just

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:38,820
add it to the previous modifications and

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,040
expect them but this is not always the

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,590
case the Salukis examples

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,940
kind of a perfect example of this for

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,270
instance in the network law we have a

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,760
connection like one always must specify

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:54,420
complete connection one cannot add or

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,860
remove IP addresses or change on a link

00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:01,140
settings with keeping the IP

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,920
configuration intact except for the

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,690
taking the connection down or up and

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,660
this may be a limitation in some cases

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:12,540
so we are thinking of possibly extending

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,310
this model in sync with unstable

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,329
networking which which is a network

00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:21,630
management for network devices like like

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:24,300
switches and actually today at 1:00 p.m.

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,730
there will be a presentation about an

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:30,890
estate project which provides an

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:34,170
interface to network manager which is

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:36,360
compatible with a simple networking in

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:40,530
which house to do those incremental

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,320
updates to the network configuration in

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,820
the case of time Singh and P dump

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,750
we always surprise the complete

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,670
configuration except for preserving the

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,080
previous provider because I'm sinkhole

00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:58,610
detector currently and provider and

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,440
keeps gives the country running one

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:06,390
because we just thought it it would not

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,790
be ethical to do for instance either new

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:12,270
NTP service to the list of servers and

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:14,640
so on on the other hand storage role we

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,580
have will have finitely generated of

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,400
course because one doesn't want to try

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,080
to remove and recreate born with file

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,140
system just to change one one attribute

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,970
so this one will have final final

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,770
generality of changes so we took a

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,700
pragmatic approach and the generated of

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:37,680
changes corresponds to to the use case

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,480
that we are addressing Oh conclusion a I

00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,490
would I would say that administrators

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,490
right we'll of course never be

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,750
completely boring there will be always

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,059
interesting things most in the positive

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,359
and negative sense

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,149
I work at least I think can help with

00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:57,479
addressing one of one source of negative

00:18:54,149 --> 00:19:01,080
surprises this is those changes to the

00:18:57,479 --> 00:19:04,379
system interfaces and especially if you

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,229
if you are using ansible anyway give a

00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:12,210
try to all if if they address your your

00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:14,340
scenarios because they provide us a

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,009
simple interface to the system as well

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:22,229
as abstracting away those those defenses

00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:24,029
so it's fully supported on l76 and later

00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:27,830
except for the postfix form which we

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:31,710
consider student review and it's

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:35,159
available as a p.m. and for users of

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,580
other systems you can use ansible galaxy

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,950
to install the roles from from galaxy

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:45,179
and they will be soon also available as

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:47,639
an RPM similar well in infographic this

00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,859
is our homepage and select links to the

00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:52,979
github project page and ansible galaxy

00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:56,239
page so thank you John for attention and

00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,239
now it's time for questions

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:05,230
