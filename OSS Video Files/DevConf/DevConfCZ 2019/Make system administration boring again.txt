	Presentation name: Make system administration boring again
Speakers: Pavel Cahyna, Till Maas
Description:  APIs strive to make programmer's jobs easier by keeping stability. Less attention is perhaps being paid to stability of system configuration, where interfaces include configuration file formats and various utilities. Ansible is a great tool for system management, but keeping Ansible playbooks across major upgrades can be challenging due to those interface differences. Come to learn how we are solving this problem using standardized Ansible roles - Linux System Roles.

Attendees will gain a practical understanding of how to use Linux System Roles with Ansible to configure their Fedora, RHEL or CentOS systems consistently across multiple releases. The audience is assumed to have a basic understanding of Ansible and experience with Linux (preferably Fedora-derived) system administration.
