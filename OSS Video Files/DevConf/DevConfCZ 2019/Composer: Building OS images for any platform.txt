	Presentation name: Composer: Building OS images for any platform
Speakers: Jenn Giardino, Will Woods
Description:  ntroducing Cockpit Composer, a new tool that lets you create, edit, and manage customized OS images over time. Create blueprints with custom selections of packages and modules from different source repositories. Then generate images from those blueprints for physical, virtual, and cloud environments. Learn about what features are currently available in the web UI, including how to select the content you need and how to create images. As part of this session, we want to take some time to get feedback from the audience on the flow of features presented and their image building needs.
