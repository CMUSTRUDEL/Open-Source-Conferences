Title: WiFi & Privacy treats what NetworkManager can do
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: WiFi & Privacy treats what NetworkManager can do
Speaker: Francesco Giudici
Description:  When a network connection is attempted, some unique identifiers must be disclosed (namely the MAC address and the DHCP Client Identifier). If they are not properly managed, it could be really easy to track a user.
After a brief overview about these unique identifiers, you will learn how to tune NetworkManager configuration in order to achieve your desired level of privacy. You will see also in which way that could affect your connections.

hello hello everyone I am Francesca do

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,030
DG I'm a software developer at reddit

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:21,920
and I'm also a team member of the

00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:24,200
network manager project have you ever

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,690
stopped at a while thinking what kind of

00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,730
information people may leak when they

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:34,520
connect to a free Wi-Fi network

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:37,820
welcome to be around I I did I did and

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,410
in order to really understand what this

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:47,030
information could be I got a trip to the

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,790
mall I usually go with my wife and that

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,190
time since I knew that there would have

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:56,059
been a free Wi-Fi network I brought

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,450
there my laptop the first thing I did

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:02,780
there was to turn my Wi-Fi device into

00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,290
monitor mode this means that it will be

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,000
able to capture all the frames that will

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,580
be there without may need to be

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,970
associated to any network or difference

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,310
that will flow in the air and also it

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,950
will be able to show me management

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,880
frames which basically argues it to

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,710
discover wireless network nearby and

00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:31,180
perform the association to the Wi-Fi

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:34,070
network when when I was there basically

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,170
after putting a team on remote I started

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,200
Wireshark to do a capture of all the

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:43,220
frames I left my laptop running for 10

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,830
minutes then I shut it off and went with

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,490
my wife me shopping because I care about

00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,630
Wi-Fi privacy but I'm more concerned to

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,630
not make her upset

00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:59,980
so here the capture roughly I captured

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,490
45,000 frames

00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,950
they're not that much and I started

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,860
looking what was there that could up to

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:13,240
identify me as a person or out to track

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,430
people I don't really need it to see the

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,590
capture to understand that the very

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:24,070
first thing that I have to take care of

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:26,980
if the MAC address we know that which

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,110
Wi-Fi device is a sign under a MAC

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,739
address in a factory this is called a

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,780
burn in MAC address and this is unique

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,420
in the world so this could be a really

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,360
sensitive if we leak this we'll try to

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,270
connect to a Wi-Fi network but where we

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,590
find what we leak or when we expose our

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:50,620
MAC address well as we said in every

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,070
frame that is transmitted so you will

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,380
always see it in the earth but what

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,200
could be not trivial to understand is

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,820
that it could be on silicon when you are

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,709
not connected to a Wi-Fi network as we

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,870
briefly introduced there are some

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,320
management frames which are called probe

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,049
request that the West Wi-Fi needs to

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,390
send out to discover if there is some

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:21,610
access point nearby and this will

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:25,209
contain the address - so what can you do

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,980
to deal with this you can switch off

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,730
Wi-Fi that's trivial

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:36,670
but of course they could not be the best

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:40,870
solution you could just randomize it and

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:43,510
so how could you do that Network major

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,920
first of all you will be very happy to

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,660
know that network manager already does

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,880
randomization of your MAC address for

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,450
the probe request frame so when scanning

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:59,319
for our other look for nearby networks

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:03,969
so one less problem to deal with

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:06,640
but from association and in word you can

00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,890
control which kind of Mikado's will be

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,939
disclosed it with the colonel the

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:15,099
cutters property and you have a bunch of

00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:18,519
values that he could put the jar of

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:23,470
course you can put a castle MAC address

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,000
or you have some preset value that will

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,990
determine the behavior or network

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,520
manager for you namely you can see

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,770
preserve means don't touch MAC address

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,720
maybe you're ready to care of it with

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,240
another external program or you're ready

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,460
to change it and not sequential will not

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,070
do anything with that when enabled the

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,229
connection you can ask himself to use

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,690
the Bernardin MAC address of course this

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:50,139
is not for privacy but maybe you have a

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,699
good reason to have a MAC address to

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,000
disclose your real MAC address maybe in

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,919
a corporate Wi-Fi network you can pick

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,370
up a stable MAC address which is

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,570
basically this table values that will

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,470
find a network manager configuration

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,680
means to pick up a random value but that

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,289
will kept stable each time you activate

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,680
that specific connection this is good

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:19,210
because you can run method while keeping

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,280
a stable behavior over across random

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,139
this means that each time you activate a

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:30,130
connection the MAC address will be

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:33,220
changed are you changes well the the

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:39,400
easiest way to change it is to use the

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:42,669
annum CLI to it's as easy as writing on

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,909
July connection modify your connection

00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:49,599
name cloning Mac is the property you

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:54,130
want to change and a value that you

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:57,190
choose if one prefers instead graphical

00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:01,810
user interface you can do that also

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:05,440
with the name connection editor you can

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,930
fire it up you will have just a

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,520
graphical user interface and you have to

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,340
pick up

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:16,050
they will fight up there there will be a

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:19,830
clone of my god res fill to fill and you

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,289
have a drop-down menu where you can pick

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:27,289
up the presets or just clicking and put

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:30,419
your own MAC address so make a dress

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:33,539
it's not that a big deal we are just to

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:37,729
randomize it let's see what else it's in

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:43,080
our whaleshark capture probe request

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:48,780
again we said these are used to discover

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,849
nearby Wi-Fi networks here

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,320
it's our capture filter about four

00:06:50,849 --> 00:07:00,229
requests it's around 10% of the packets

00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:02,550
i'll call exeter and you can see that

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:08,810
among all the probe requests there are

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:12,449
few that contain a specific SSID what

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,900
that's what if you kept broadcasting

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:19,470
your Wi-Fi ccd it will be easier to

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:23,460
track him let's take one in particular

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:28,080
to see what happens i think this i took

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:31,050
this as noted by this as SSID i'll here

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,750
anonymous it because I want to be

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:38,039
legally fluid I don't know if it would

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,409
directly SSID Lou something family there

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:43,199
is a station that is broadcasting this

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:46,229
for all the 10 minutes and we can see

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,199
that that MAC address is changing is

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:53,880
random Alice is trying to not be a

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,969
tracker but if we are able to see this

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,219
broadcast of the especially of this on a

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:03,110
specific SSD variable anyway to

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,110
understand that that is the same user

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:12,719
what about 10m well network manger but

00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,570
what it will not put a necessity in

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:19,250
probe requests that's great if you don't

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,250
trust me ask you this together

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,340
what happens then

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,500
after Association once you are

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,980
associated to the associated to the

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,130
Wi-Fi network you will have to get a new

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:38,940
address in order to communicate so you

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,840
will start DHCP request and with ESP

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,360
request request common DHCP options and

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,680
some could lick some Sun sensitive

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,200
informations the first one of course is

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,850
get CP client identifier this is a

00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:00,450
mandatory option and as disappear for

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,490
specification States the client identify

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,680
must be unique among the client

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,170
indentified use it on the subnet to

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,580
which the country is attached so the

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:15,210
perfect palette is for attractive maybe

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,130
it's even worse for this pv6 were the

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:20,870
option which has the same name but it's

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:25,940
a different option because it's for ipv6

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:30,240
carries DCP unique identifier the UID

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,720
which basically is meant to identify the

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,540
Aust

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,630
not that particular disappear request

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,270
that is sending out so and this is

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:43,140
required to be permanent so it means

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,300
that announced that will use its p v6

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,410
for every connection every interface we

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:57,450
will use we will sum out always the same

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:59,520
do it and in order to differentiate this

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,500
P request coming from the same most may

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,770
be on different interfaces on different

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:09,090
connection another option is used in get

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:12,050
CP 6 or a specification where you put an

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,070
identity Association ID and basically

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,140
binding the DUID

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,610
and the identities of Association ID it

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:24,720
tells you to to identify basically a

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:28,290
single disapper request North makes

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,390
things more current there's another

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,140
specification

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:36,980
that is our c43 61 let's write to convey

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:40,060
to a more current description of the

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,769
Coyotes identifier let's suggest to use

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,709
for the client identified net repeat

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:50,300
before a combination of the DUID

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:54,790
and over the identity Association ID so

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:58,690
we said the DUI ID is unique perast so

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:03,019
what can we do with that also people

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:05,810
also people dealing with the

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:08,990
specification came up with this question

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:14,269
and the solution was another

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:16,640
specification FCC 78 44 they told me

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,760
it's called anonymity profiles for DHCP

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,750
clients they basically told you okay if

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,200
you need privacy maybe the the common

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:31,279
standard doesn't work for you so if you

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,010
want really to be an anonymous user a

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,709
profile where you use a random Akkad

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,250
rest as we already seen and you base

00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:43,279
your DHCP client identifiers on that's

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:48,070
random mic address so we you not like

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,070
any any particular sensitive information

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:58,670
let's go to our capture let's see if we

00:11:54,529 --> 00:12:02,690
if you look just an example here the

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:07,010
client just puts his MAC address in in

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:10,510
the community 5 there is nothing new

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:14,120
than what he already is leaking with

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:17,500
exposing is through MAC address but what

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,500
about network man

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:27,240
well you can take care of the property

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,610
DCP client ID to our whatever you want

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,630
of course you can put the custom value

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:37,750
or you can put Mac the Mac label

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,500
basically it will allow you to use your

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,779
current MAC address and this is what

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,260
Monday it's the anonymity profile

00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:48,880
specification all you can have the

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,370
permanent MAC address there if you want

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,650
to somehow you're in a corporate network

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:58,089
and you want that you're trying to be

00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:02,170
identified by that stable as usual that

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:05,020
stable identify which is randomized but

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,839
it's kept stable for the connection

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,779
return it is activated or you are also

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,410
the option to pick up the recommendation

00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:17,610
for FC 43 61 well you have a combination

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:25,029
of the UID over the intussusception ID I

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:26,740
do change it with a CLI easy as the

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,930
Animus I can actually modify your

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:35,650
connection the property to change this

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:39,490
time is ipv4 SCP client ID it could also

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:41,950
be changed as a default by applying an

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:47,380
network manager configuration file and

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:49,779
so your default will be better based on

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,580
what you really want if you know that

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:55,630
you have a laptop and you always around

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:58,000
you want maybe to help as a default to

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:02,130
use the atomic APIs as the client

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,130
identify and can change it

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,050
a bit similar for ipv6 the option in

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:16,920
that of my desk is called DHCP the uld

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:20,800
you have multiple options here let's see

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:24,490
that the one that you want to achieve

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,370
privacy al al l stands for link layer

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,820
and once again means base your do it on

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:33,120
the atomic address this is the deal is

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:37,329
compliant see the anonymity profile

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,360
standard the default instead will be to

00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:41,980
add 12 to have to pick up the do it from

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,810
a lease file if the connection has been

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,970
already started any time in the past

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:54,610
otherwise the default frenetic major is

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:58,050
to use ask for the main standard a DVD

00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:03,399
that it's permanent trust so basically

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:05,620
you will revoke their your identity you

00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,850
can change it as usual with atoms July

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,010
the property is ipv6 DHCP do it and also

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:16,680
for each one you can change the default

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,680
configuration in network renderer

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,190
let's go back to our capture what other

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:29,390
get sleepy options under that could

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:33,350
although easily threatened the us name

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:38,000
option basically here we see that the

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:42,710
client discloses its brand and its type

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,410
is way way benign right but what does

00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:49,580
network manager there by the 14th will

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:52,730
send out the hostname the SCP option in

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,100
average ACP requests and the fully

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,250
qualified domain name option for this PB

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,040
6 which is basically the same we

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:05,980
discussed basically the same thing which

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:09,920
is your system of name so you have to be

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,900
to be really aware this that if you want

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,279
to see privacy maybe you want to change

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:20,450
this and how can you what can you do

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,790
with that two options you can drop those

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:26,780
options from the DHCP request they are

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:30,589
not mandatory you can just change the

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,650
default and pv6 DHCP Sandoz name - no

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:36,530
it's just a boolean white footage yes of

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:39,710
course you can just put there whichever

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:42,680
name you want that will be used just for

00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:51,380
that connection and the optional called

00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:54,740
ipv4 or ipv6 DHCP post name so if you

00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:58,180
see me around this for me other mode

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,180
what are you going to do

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:04,390
don't it is if there is a less brutal

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,059
option

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,459
and would be to first privacy with

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,040
network manager that's for couple bits

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:16,360
first of all be sure that you mic

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:20,020
address is randomized then you have to

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,990
be sure that what the client ID for DCP

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:30,630
before and in CP v 6 will be neck based

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:30,630
and remember don't say anyone's me out

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,330
if you want a default configuration that

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,120
is targeted for an organization you

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,520
could find it in the network manager

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,970
upstream repository under the directory

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:50,110
examples and an configuration dot d who

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,419
is this dirty anon Kampf configurations

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,799
need that you can change a bit and just

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,610
drop in your network manager

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:59,919
configuration directory and you will

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,559
almost all set it will cover point 1 2 &

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,510
3 but you will not be able to cover

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,820
point 4 so you will have any way to

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,419
remember to disable sending out your

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,419
host name

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,909
that's it questions yes please

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:35,610
so the question is does not work manager

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,310
add any notion about trusted or

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,280
untrusted Network the answer is no is

00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,920
something we we are working on we want

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,420
to make all this process more much more

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,100
easier ideally we want to apply a

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,560
security dispute profile with one liner

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,410
say I want this discontinued this

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,510
network secure and all this stuff will

00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:09,180
be implanted but we're working with not

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:12,450
yet so the question is what are the

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:15,930
implication with protecting the

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:19,640
management frames yeah

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:24,930
a new feature feature from the Wi-Fi

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:27,900
well the MAC address will be anyway is

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:32,100
closer to what will happen yes it will

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:36,540
be it will allow a bit maybe to be

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,670
perfected by people like me just

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,830
sniffing in there but if a people is

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,050
able to associate to the network it will

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,260
anyway receive the broadcast so

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,420
available annually to see all the

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:54,230
disruption that you will have in the

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,230
requests another question

00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:17,270
the question is did you have any problem

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,940
with Association

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,750
if you randomize your MAC address with

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,660
Wi-Fi chips

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,030
that's may have some filters about my

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,280
cameras use it the question is yes

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,730
legacy driver will have these problems

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:35,140
and for this for this kind of drivers

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:38,420
you may want to disable the network

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:51,050
randomization during the scan you could

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:56,660
do that I can show you I guess well

00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:57,980
anyway I just I just want to take the

00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,470
main feature I don't remember the name

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,410
of the option anyway it's easy I don't

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,740
want to disclose and okay anyway it will

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,810
be it will be easy there is an option

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,930
that you can configure network manager

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,880
dot-coms

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:19,270
main configuration file and you can set

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Wi-Fi scanning during randomization off

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:26,120
just for a bunch of chips

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:29,090
that's that file that the directory

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,770
where I pointed you about the profile

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,810
you can not the professor a

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,300
configuration file that you can drop to

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:38,210
change the behavior and initiation and

00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:41,950
so on it will contain also as needed

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:45,350
show you how to disable the scanning for

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,300
this kind of wife returns randomization

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,640
your nest and for this website run it

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:55,720
could be also just for particularly

00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,720
drivers yeah

00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:14,559
yeah the question is it is possible to

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,250
randomize just apart order Mikado's

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,929
maybe to live that are we the first

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,240
first byte or the MAC address to a fix a

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:25,750
certain order that we can just appear as

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,880
a particular device the answer is yes

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,029
there are other properties that I had

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,809
not shown you that all of to configure

00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,240
in detail

00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:38,260
I'll make address randomization should

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,600
happen there is a subnet mask not a

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:45,190
something sorry a mask that you can

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:47,110
apply and to to to pick up just the

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:53,159
bytes that you want to run amass enough

00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:53,159
somebody fix yeah another question

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,460
sorry can you repeat that auditor Oh

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:19,580
what they do yeah yeah yeah the question

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:22,040
is do you have any insight of what other

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,010
operating system do which does not use a

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,440
network manager the answer is yeah I

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,880
know that there is the scanner

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,000
randomization is something that is

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:37,820
applied by many devices also mobile

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,010
phones Android on Apple and gas and also

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:43,340
not putting your SSD in Prague request

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:46,730
is something that everyone is starting

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,920
to do because you need that just when

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,040
you have an Eaton wireless network why

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,679
it's important to you why do you would

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,800
need to put your SSID when doing a probe

00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:02,059
request or in scam if the network has

00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,580
hidden SSID you will not disclose it you

00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:06,110
should come with the probably say I'm

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,620
looking from Disney episode like this

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,900
point would reply and in order to

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,809
achieve this there should be the society

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,059
there and they have an option I saw in

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,070
like latest Android release for instance

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:21,770
that in the basic properties of the

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,160
Wi-Fi configuration you can put this is

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:27,679
what I eat on Wi-Fi network we have the

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,520
same also in network manager you can

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:34,820
tweak it on a connection bit so yes I
