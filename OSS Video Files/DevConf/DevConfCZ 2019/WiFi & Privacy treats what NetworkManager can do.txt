	Presentation name: WiFi & Privacy treats what NetworkManager can do
Speaker: Francesco Giudici
Description:  When a network connection is attempted, some unique identifiers must be disclosed (namely the MAC address and the DHCP Client Identifier). If they are not properly managed, it could be really easy to track a user.
After a brief overview about these unique identifiers, you will learn how to tune NetworkManager configuration in order to achieve your desired level of privacy. You will see also in which way that could affect your connections.
