Speaker: Rashid Khan
Description:  Waterfall model, and tennis match between QE and Devel is so last century. We all have constraints of time, resources, budgets, people, but despite all of that we have reached a state of near nirvana between QE and Development in Networking Team. We would like to share how we achieved that. In this session we will share some practical ideas about how Development and QE can establish trust, collaboration, coordination, and help make our products more robust, and in turn help our partners and customers.
