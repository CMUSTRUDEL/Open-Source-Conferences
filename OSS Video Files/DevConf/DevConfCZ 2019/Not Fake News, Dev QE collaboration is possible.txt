Title: Not Fake News, Dev QE collaboration is possible
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: Not Fake News, Dev QE collaboration is possible
Speaker: Rashid Khan
Description:  Waterfall model, and tennis match between QE and Devel is so last century. We all have constraints of time, resources, budgets, people, but despite all of that we have reached a state of near nirvana between QE and Development in Networking Team. We would like to share how we achieved that. In this session we will share some practical ideas about how Development and QE can establish trust, collaboration, coordination, and help make our products more robust, and in turn help our partners and customers.

	00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,340
my name is Roger time I worked out of

00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,059
the Detroit office

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:28,630
welcome to the networking track I'm

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:30,040
supposed to open the track but talking

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:46,780
about the track on seriousness there if

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:50,409
you click the networking icon we'll just

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:54,749
be in this room until like 3:00 and then

00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:58,329
we have three we have the workshop and

00:00:54,749 --> 00:01:00,969
Wi-Fi in parallel sessions but if you

00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,920
are interested in networking and want to

00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,530
just stick around in a nice warm room

00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,630
next to coffee and bathrooms this is a

00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,780
good choice

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,640
okay with that said so not fake news

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:31,750
development and TV collaboration is

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:33,850
possible how many people so as I said my

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,340
name is Rajesh Khanna I this slide deck

00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,259
is in collaboration with

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,969
people it would have been ironic if I

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:48,210
did not collaborate with Yui

00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:49,710
on the slide deck that I was not on the

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,000
slide deck it was too late so if you

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,789
have questions feel free to ask me

00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:12,180
afterwards so what I mean by

00:01:53,789 --> 00:02:14,630
collaboration is so this guy has picks

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,489
up a flaming tennis ball and lobs it

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,590
across so imagine the first guy is

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,959
development he finds this hot new

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:34,410
feature and then over the net he just

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:36,450
lobs it and the other this is a problem

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,239
that sometimes happens not that it

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,250
happens in Red Hat at all but I'm just

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,850
saying I've heard this happen sometimes

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:54,359
or the other scenario is this that

00:02:44,850 --> 00:03:00,900
development for the people who are we

00:02:54,359 --> 00:03:02,730
call quality assurance to make sure it's

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,709
too early in the morning the other thing

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,650
is oh I'm a developer

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,970
I don't do testing I swear to god there

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,669
was a person who worked for me in

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,440
another company he did quote that to me

00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm a developer I don't do testing

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,340
I was very shocked the company still

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,310
exists where I left them

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,440
I don't do QE it's give me his job so

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,870
that believe it or not it does still

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,330
happen and water for models and all

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,370
kinds of crap still happens so these are

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,360
I just wanted to start with the level

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:44,120
set and I'll be four I started this

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,120
effort a little bit of this was going on

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,630
but we took a lot of journey we'll talk

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,000
about that so what does it result this

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,010
result in obviously it results in

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,290
failure if you just love it over the

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,840
wall QE has no idea or throw them a ball

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,070
of hot feature or what you think is hot

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,420
it results in absolute failure so enough

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,620
of the videos now let's get to the

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:14,510
serious stuff Oh what just when I said

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,510
serious stuff so the front guy obviously

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,590
that we do have the boat running in

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,650
sequence and we are achieving great

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,620
results so with that said yes this is

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,990
the last one okay so how did we do that

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,470
if you are here to learn something

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,610
earth-shattering sorry to disappoint you

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,610
I don't have anything

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,729
okay so because somebody pointed out

00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,460
Russia that you have a type on the slide

00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:59,580
so how did we do that

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,389
just level set I don't have any

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,819
earth-shattering stuff but we have a

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,280
whole bunch of small stuff that we did

00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,860
and it has a journey it took a long time

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,379
to get here I would say about five ish

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,530
years so it's a long duration and a lot

00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:16,270
of effort and energy well for issues we

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,729
have been reaping the benefits for about

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,949
two years now but three four years so

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,620
the fundamental thing is openness and

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,539
Trust I know it's easier to say then

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,699
I'll show you what I mean by that but

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,370
the two fundamental things that I would

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,800
summarize this with collaboration with Q

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,860
is openness and Trust we'll come back to

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,719
it in a second so let's talk about some

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,219
practical things that we did I just want

00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:46,180
to share with you some practical things

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:48,129
but I just wanted to share because there

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,610
might not be obvious so we took that

00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:53,830
lead in doing our own unit testing and

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,259
we created this framework called tiered

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,060
zero testing we call it Ln st but other

00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,370
kinds of automated testing that we

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,940
developed ourselves and we develop with

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,639
QE so what does that mean so earlier

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,770
before we started this effort somebody

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,180
musta patch in the Vice theme or our

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,479
mainline main branch it stood for eight

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,479
months

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,889
[Music]

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,419
gone down the drain

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:33,340
and but the problem also I we found the

00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:35,260
problem this was the strategy months ago

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,699
it was worst day and I said can we

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,780
revert it and the answer was no why

00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,780
because what each month

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:48,970
other times we had cascaded on top of it

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:50,770
and now on top of it so it was like a

00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,729
slap in the face for me and saying look

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,880
this has to stop so now we developed a

00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:00,010
system in which whatever will be merging

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,800
even before it goes to our main line or

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:05,410
bias team as we call it it's tested it's

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,000
tested very thoroughly and it's tested

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,160
for regression detection is tested for

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,229
any kind of dip it doesn't cover

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,000
everything but at least it covers like

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,460
basic connections and the basic stuff

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,260
that supposed to be working and then if

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,530
there is a problem it causes a problem

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,630
even let's say 5% degradation then we

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,720
just pull the horses hold on a second

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:28,330
this best worst case two weeks worth of

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,789
patches we quickly isolate which patch

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:37,389
and we stop the presses and say okay we

00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:40,510
have to either revert this out so bugs

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:43,630
are squished in days and this reduced

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,360
the bugs going into QE by a tremendous

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:50,580
amount so now when QE starts their

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,500
testing I did they don't have day one

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,860
stop the presses kind of bug because we

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,970
already cast it on so that's pretty cool

00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,620
so there are some quotes that I've

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,120
sprinkled in a presentation I'm not

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,590
going to say them but if you see

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,960
something in blue on the side or

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,450
something that's an exact quote that I

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,960
copy pasted from some QE members who

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,880
look at my slides so see I is really

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,630
revealing bugs even before the code is

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,020
merged this is a merit badge

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,880
is what I would like to make a laminated

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,280
thing and hang around my neck all the

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,140
time because this is exactly what I was

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,090
trying to achieve what our team was at

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,060
I'm trying to achieve when we started

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,070
this effort an unsolicited I got this

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,820
quote from one of the QE person that I

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,770
really respect and when I showed him my

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:45,640
slide hey this is what I'm gonna show in

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:49,510
reply he sent me this code that CI is

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,680
really showing bugs before even the code

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:55,600
is much awesome okay what else did we do

00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:02,080
we created a qualification process for

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:04,330
hardware certification so sorry we

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,490
didn't have that but what we did was we

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,860
one of our developers in our team

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,720
developed some tests for his own testing

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,770
that he is not causing any regressions

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,140
and it was so thorough and so good and

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:21,460
so fast and slow automated that we work

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,710
with we created an automated framework

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:36,040
around it and now we have a whole bunch

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:38,980
of tests even earlier we used to bring

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,560
the mail merge batch code is done send

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:48,090
it to QE you will find issues and then

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:48,090
problem starts now guys we absolutely

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,040
you're awesome but here's a whole bunch

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,810
of automated tests that you don't need a

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,760
traffic generator for you don't need any

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,140
external of the Cookman for you don't

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,570
need any expensive piece of equipment

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,910
all you need to do is one or two one

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,590
senior quality Yui person and Avenue 20

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,430
person can run these tests on the old

00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:10,470
card on your driver on your own and

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,000
output is a result which is a

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,750
spreadsheet which has green and red

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,210
lights like pass/fail pass/fail and when

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:32,150
you have the whole spreadsheet

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:35,279
please bring it in and we will in this

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,279
[Music]

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,630
week so whatever time you need you will

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,570
be part of next release cycle they said

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,980
fine we started a dialogue with them

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:03,360
trust me they found bugs that they were

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,640
surprised with so instead of having

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,620
everybody come in and then toad is

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,290
merged in and then now is the problem we

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,300
said please run this on your own in your

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,160
own environment we'll help you set up

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,080
the environment if needed and then we do

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,550
it Wow time flies I talk a lot so the

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,200
other thing we did was so this was

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,060
development taking the lead the other

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,130
side was QE take the lead sometimes and

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,530
Hughie developed this network manager

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,690
testing which is super Auto magic it

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:34,020
runs all the time it runs in the

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,970
background and it covers 90% of the code

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,580
the allen st that i talked about also

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,350
covers a large amount of code it doesn't

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,430
cover everything but it covers a lot

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:47,000
also the other thing another thing we do

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,000
is we

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,819
so if you change the TCP stack in

00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:56,199
fundamental ways sometimes we have to

00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:02,049
because there's a lot of innovation

00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:04,119
upstream and we bring it in we do our

00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:10,989
own testing but then we ask you it can

00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:14,170
you please run your on this code that we

00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:15,639
are about to bring in before it's part

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,379
of the white stream and that works out

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,839
very well also so it gives you either

00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:26,079
preview and there is no flaming tennis

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:28,209
balls we look at their test plans and it

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,980
works out quite well we start a dialogue

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:35,220
they tell us the deltas between release

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,220
to release and we do a thorough thorough

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:40,839
investigation / feedback loop on the

00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:42,489
test plans and we said oh this maybe you

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,069
need to do this a little bit more you

00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:47,110
need to do this a little bit less and it

00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:48,699
works out very well again a direct quote

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,649
I would really like to stress out the

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,129
devel collaboration and willingness to

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,929
help anytime and I didn't even change

00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:58,149
the font this is the exact quote with

00:12:55,929 --> 00:13:02,579
that font in there which is awesome this

00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:02,579
is a merit match for me or our team

00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:10,439
develop rise QE with features so we have

00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,439
a major release coming out

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,740
by non-red factors but what we did was

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,180
we said we did an audit of the whole

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,730
release what we are bringing in from

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,130
upstream and we created an MVP list who

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,560
are most important to test or etc and we

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,110
told key we hate you please watch out

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,120
this is the new stuff coming in a lot of

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,829
it is not touched by us but it will be

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,930
part of the release please make sure

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,660
your test plans and everything is

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,519
prepared for that so again not like

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,829
logging it over the wall and go figure

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,800
it out QE all the man pages are upstream

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:46,600
no we don't do that we say okay hold on

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,920
it's we are in this together let's work

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,910
it out together take pre do sometimes we

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,910
don't know all the answers

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,679
[Music]

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:11,110
we have customers testing it partners

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,940
testing it and then once so there are

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,550
two aspects to it putting in tech review

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,440
is pretty cool and everybody agrees he

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,199
we understand that but what we did was

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,660
me collaborate with Yui to say hey are

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:28,930
you we are going to not take this out of

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:30,250
they have to test it much much

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,529
thoroughly because it's a supported

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:36,519
feature so we have a dialogue we discuss

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:40,980
it together and we figure it out boss if

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,449
I started at 9:30 then I have some time

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,899
okay okay okay

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:54,130
I your reminder threw me off a little

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:58,319
bit but I have some time okay so now so

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,319
this was all more of a technical stuff

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:09,219
[Music]

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,019
bottom line is mutual respect and Trust

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:21,200
so the at the lower right of my next few

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:23,630
slides you'll see this so we we provide

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,470
career path for qet members we have

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,720
about from my account four or five

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,250
previous QE team members were part of

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,250
our development team now

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,250
sometimes they reach their limit QE and

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,050
but there's not much that they are

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,540
enjoying in QE anymore there's not a

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,519
challenge so the QV manager reaches out

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,070
to me saying hey I have this person is a

00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,470
little bit bored now would you mind we

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,660
talked to them they like us we like them

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,570
they move to our team we give them a rec

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,149
they hire another QE % awesome works out

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,190
every single time every single person

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,050
was moved to QE from development has

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,450
been a superstar which is awesome

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,490
awesome awesome that number three is

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,959
wrong now that I do a mental audit it's

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,959
much more than three I think it's five

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:35,710
so we want to use it we don't have the

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,320
same equipment or we don't have

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:52,060
[Music]

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:53,860
absolutely and we told you II sang okay

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,290
how about we absorb the cost of the

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,060
chassis and the first car and we will

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,100
share with you you will integrate it

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,530
into your test plans and then from there

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,300
on you can just punch in your cards in

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,580
that chassis and you don't have to worry

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,000
about that the cost of the overhead of

00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,120
the chassis or this signalling and etc

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,580
again

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,770
sounds like the G door why didn't you do

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,050
it before but a lot of time it doesn't

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,600
happen that's why I'm emphasizing it so

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,550
we share hardware as much as we can and

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,140
sometimes they qualify something and say

00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,330
rocket we found this awesome deal in

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,220
Beijing it's really cool we're going to

00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,140
put it in Beijing the latency is not

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,560
that bad the packets can come all the

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,480
way to Westford now that if the car is

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,890
no longer part of iti can say the

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,870
packets are coming from Beijing to our

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:41,260
lab and respite otherwise you would have

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:45,820
closed it right from his phone so that's

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:48,640
pretty cool and then we interview each

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,710
other's candidates because again mutual

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,800
trust and respect we talk to each other

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,900
say so my counterpart calls me I call

00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:00,010
her and say hey do you mind we talk to

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:08,410
each other we even offered money to hire

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:10,630
people don't tell my boss yeah they do

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,250
never took it but again mutual trust and

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,430
respect it's okay you need to hire

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:18,910
someone you are short by whatever 10,000

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:22,200
CZK sure I'll bar you can borrow from me

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:27,880
you can replenish etc so we work jointly

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,770
this is not common gave advice to each

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,470
other for people management team

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:38,110
management project management all the

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:40,800
time in the end hugs and kisses mutual

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,800
respect and

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,690
so I know I rushed a little bit we have

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,210
five minutes left so that's good

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:52,870
and that should be plenty to answer

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:55,240
questions this was by level I did not

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,570
want to start with like a JavaScript

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,570
engine

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:06,220
no heat so just to get the juices

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,680
flowing questions other other things

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:14,160
which were curious that I didn't explain

00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,160
well yes

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:36,710
so five years ago is my example of that

00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,299
eight months ago the batch maintained

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:50,629
that's when I realized we have to do

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:53,710
aside the question and Dmitry asked can

00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:57,679
i highlight some of those steps

00:19:53,710 --> 00:20:02,529
so five years ago to the point when I

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,529
realized that no we have to test sooner

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:09,849
so what we did was we dedicated first of

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:15,649
all we dedicated people to start our own

00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:17,929
wisely so we had some people who were in

00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:20,570
I don't remember I think we hired people

00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:23,539
on board got some people from QE to our

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:26,539
team who started working full time to

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,419
develop this basic regression detection

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,309
test advice and he collaborated with

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,289
many different parts of QE and other

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:36,499
teams to develop the dispersed structure

00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:38,720
that does not a test computer the result

00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:41,629
stores the results or the configuration

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,179
of everything makes it repeatable finds

00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:46,159
the tests which fail creates a script

00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:48,259
just for the tests that spilled and

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,210
gives it to the devil so we start now

00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:52,399
this is the end result but we started

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,759
that this slowly slowly now is so robust

00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:59,269
that now developers can request and lmst

00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:03,799
test even before they hurt we test them

00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:05,900
before going to ice cream but the

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:11,840
evening world we Wesley

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:17,210
people and a small team hardly there is

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,250
deadly and we turned it into our gate so

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,900
those were once it was raining and enjoy

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,190
and we had trust I mean he had

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,800
understanding of the whole device

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,740
forgive that yeah it's working we clear

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,780
turned it into a gate so now to use red

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,020
heck turns in created a sub maintainer

00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,700
branch for networking JD is the

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,040
maintainer for that he collects all the

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,450
patches before going divisor the

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,570
connects on the Majesty it is a bill

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,700
puts it in this st if it won't be he

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,660
merges it to my scheme if it's not bring

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,610
you stop the presses

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,720
call rockets and gosh with your patch

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,670
rope

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,650
do you want to revert or do you wanna

00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:55,610
fix you wanna fix you have a couple of

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:58,130
these so that was step one that we

00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,570
dedicated people for this and they are

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,700
still dedicated and they keep on

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,100
enhancing and keep on expanding the

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,840
coverage of that test and now they're

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,770
doing like advanced stuff like Oh VSD

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,690
PDK the CTP is ready it's really no

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,210
person after them I think the whole

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:17,990
cycle now it takes one day to complete

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:21,140
on four machines and we are thinking of

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,820
paralyzing it on my part was even if it

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,980
takes a weekend like we started on a

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,810
Friday and Monday morning we have the

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:38,570
report still it's fine so I just found

00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:41,300
out it takes a day ago it was already

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:45,250
showing its fruits first fruits and now

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,250
it's just the orchard is growing

00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:39,360
yes yes a lot of times to my utter

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,850
surprise it's what we thought was being

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,250
tested upstream was not as robust as we

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,110
thought somebody had sprinkled few tests

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,600
here and there but it was not as robust

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,820
as we needed and then I kept telling

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,610
people about this my disastrous example

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,340
that hey guys if we go with that model

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:58,500
where we test at the end eight months we

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:02,540
could not revert remember that time so

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,540
we had to use a crisis

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,419
I think that what we did was we said

00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:15,720
this is do you mind I saw on the other

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:18,600
side we did a news report into hi I find

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,770
it up to British power like boss boss

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,140
boss boss

00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:36,090
and we develop a relationship which is

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:41,700
not like you what do you need how can

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:44,029
either honestly that's how I and I'll be

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,360
honest with you it was phenomenal

00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,360
once we you start

00:25:50,290 --> 00:26:00,760
on the other side nose job there's a

00:25:52,970 --> 00:26:00,760
problem business all the time okay

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:12,309
