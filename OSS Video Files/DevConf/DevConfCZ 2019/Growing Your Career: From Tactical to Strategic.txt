	Presentation name: Growing Your Career: From Tactical to Strategic
Speakers: Eliska Slobodova, Jennifer Albertson, Erica von Buelow, Aleksandra Fedorova, Jessica Forrester
Description:  Have you ever considered transitioning from an individual contributor to a leadership role? As you are promoted, your success flows less from your own technical achievements and more from your ability to inspire and guide others. To make your mark as a technical leader, youâ€™ll need to lead, engage, motivate, and influence others regardless of whether they report to you. Our panelists will share insights about their career changes and the lessons they have learned. Attendees who are, or are thinking of, transitioning from tactical to strategic roles will be armed with advice on how to leverage their experience, networks, and unique brand to identify where they want to go in their careers. Participants are encouraged to engage in discussion and ask questions.
