	Presentation name: Challenges of product owner in a new agile team
Speaker: Jan Zeleny
Description:  Product Owners are key in any agile teams that are being formed. They are communication hubs between their teams and all of their teams' stakeholders. They are also important advisors of the team. It is these people that often take the first hit when something does not work ideally ... which happens a lot in new projects. In this session we will take a look into the life of product owners as their projects take off, what hits they take and how do they deal with them.

At the end of the session, the product owners in the audience will have some tips how to make their own lives easier. They will also know that they are not alone. The rest of the audience will have a better understanding of challenges the product owners face which will help them understand how to communicate more effectively.
