Title: Challenges of product owner in a new agile team
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: Challenges of product owner in a new agile team
Speaker: Jan Zeleny
Description:  Product Owners are key in any agile teams that are being formed. They are communication hubs between their teams and all of their teams' stakeholders. They are also important advisors of the team. It is these people that often take the first hit when something does not work ideally ... which happens a lot in new projects. In this session we will take a look into the life of product owners as their projects take off, what hits they take and how do they deal with them.

At the end of the session, the product owners in the audience will have some tips how to make their own lives easier. They will also know that they are not alone. The rest of the audience will have a better understanding of challenges the product owners face which will help them understand how to communicate more effectively.

is this thing on yeah

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,220
it is I can hear myself I'm not sure

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,860
whether that's a good thing that I can

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,690
hear myself but let's let's write it so

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,210
you already know what I'm gonna talk

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,970
about my name is Yann Cellini I am an

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,810
engineering manager at Red Hat but I'm

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,359
also part product owner being there for

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,980
quite some time and I would like to

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,859
share some of my experience with you

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,970
hopefully that will that will help some

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,640
of you

00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,010
but first by the show of hands do we

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,440
have any product owners in the audience

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,920
or product managers ok we got a couple

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,930
they're there they're excellent do we

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,020
have someone who wants to be a product

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,900
owner and is not product owner ok we

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,120
have one maybe two three candidates this

00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,130
is good so for those of you who are

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,280
product owners or wish to be product

00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:02,280
owners hopefully this will show you what

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,199
the role is like for the rest of you I

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,350
hope this presentation will help you

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:13,620
understand why product owners are the

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:16,230
way they are ok so as I said for the

00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,020
product owners in the audience this this

00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,940
is not a comprehensive guideline this is

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,620
not a this is not a guide how to do your

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,390
job

00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,620
this is to show you that you are not

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,479
alone the challenges are transferable I

00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,909
have been in multiple teams where I was

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,750
a product owner and the challenges are

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,960
pretty much the same they often appear

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:43,080
different but they are very similar you

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,750
should know that you know you should not

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,210
panic it gets better if your teams if

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,700
your team is starring there are some

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,390
very unique challenges but they do get

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,100
better in time and the purpose of the

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,310
presentation is hopefully to help you

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,560
understand I want to say two things

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,290
first this presentation will be somewhat

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,880
in contrast to what Jen was talking

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,729
about in the previous presentation

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,039
because ok so so let me ask you this

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,900
have you been in a situation where

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,569
somebody was supposed to make a decision

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,700
and they didn't and they they were

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,430
hiding

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,590
behind I don't know a consensus or I

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,410
don't know somebody else making a

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:29,750
decision or a collective decision any

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:32,269
hands yes okay cool so that's that's one

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,360
thing which I will try to illustrate how

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:38,780
to deal with that and what you can what

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,030
you can expect there and I also want to

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,860
also know make a note here that this

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,890
presentation talks about the challenges

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,769
of product owners which means it might

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,099
illustrate the job illustrate the role

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:54,380
in a slightly negative light please take

00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,680
that into account because the role is

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,209
really not that bad it's just that the

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,430
presentation is really focused on only

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:04,700
one side of the job not not only the

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,290
good things okay so let's take a look at

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,130
the definition of product owner this is

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,680
what wikipedia says or at least loosely

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,360
so product owner represents product

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,540
stakeholders and the voice of customer

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,670
makes sense right product owner is

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,440
responsible for the product backlog at

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,880
least partially there are other people

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,750
who can help you with product backlog

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,670
but it is product owner responsibility

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,160
to make sure that the backlog is in a

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,560
good shape and product owner is

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,049
accountable for maximizing the value

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,459
that the team delivers there's the

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:44,450
theory however when a when a new team is

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:48,170
forming it gets slightly different let's

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,590
take a look at the reality in the real

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,090
work of a starting project the first two

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,519
are still pretty much the same

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,250
the third one however is slightly

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,470
different in my experience you as a

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,299
product owner are not accountable just

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,120
for maximizing the value your team

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:09,019
delivers you are accountable for the

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,389
success of the product you are

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:14,480
accountable for a survival of the

00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,180
product and a team and if you as a

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,620
product owner have what have just one

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,099
thing to take away from this

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,039
presentation let it be this one you own

00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:26,930
the product and in a good way I don't

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,350
mean it like you you you are you should

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,840
control what happens and

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,820
product but you are the person who is

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,980
ultimately accountable for anything that

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,560
happens if every other instance if

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,750
everything else fails in the team or in

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,970
the product you are the one to make

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,130
decisions if they need to be done let's

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,980
take a look at what does it mean to

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:56,580
start a project every project starts

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:58,080
with an idea every single one and I was

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,110
kind of thinking about how do you define

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,470
the project being started like where's

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,940
the end of the start phase when I

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,570
thought about it and what I want to talk

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,210
about today is the first release as the

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,050
milestone which kind of ends this the

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,180
starting of the project so and yeah

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,340
there is there is this red section on

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,260
the left-hand side between the first

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,270
idea and the first people on the project

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,240
I'm not going to talk about that because

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:30,120
it may or may not be you to convince all

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,550
the stakeholders the sponsors to to give

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,920
you someone to work on that it is

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,680
effectively at this point or where the

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,560
project gets started so this is what I'm

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,420
gonna go what I want to talk about

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,890
between each two milestones there are

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,070
different phases so I want to talk about

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,680
those and the challenge is specific to

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,530
those and we'll end with the first

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,500
release of the product so you get your

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,440
first people or you were assigned to a

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,780
team that works on a specific project

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,160
and you were asked to be a product owner

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:08,130
so what's first research we're not

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,520
talking about academic research here we

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:14,610
are talking about the state of the art

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,980
in this phase you want to know where the

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,630
idea is even technically feasible

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,360
because whoever came up with the idea

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,040
might or might not know or they might

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,870
think it's feasible but you need to be

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,950
sure before you start working on it

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,080
right it's also about the state of the

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,940
art and whether it whether you can reuse

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,520
the state of the art because obviously

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,620
you don't want to reinvent the wheel so

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,200
you want to you want the team to first

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,550
spend some time you know exploring the

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,120
field and what's out there what

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,069
what they can use what they can build on

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,560
all this ultimately leads to initial

00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,470
implementation the first code that you

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,830
can push into a git repository and the

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,610
team can start working on it

00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,870
let's take a look at some of the

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:02,400
challenges the first one being

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:05,400
motivation or the team Y motivation is

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,460
or can be a challenge the thing is that

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,389
this research phase it doesn't have to

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,970
be one day to day to weeks it can be it

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,620
can be as long as a couple months or or

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,419
half a year something like that

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,599
depending on how challenging your

00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:26,370
project is or how big of an idea at the

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,919
beginning was created and in this

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,669
research phase you're basically trying

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:37,289
to solve different problem but from

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:38,909
slightly different angles it might feel

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,530
to the engineers it might feel like

00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:43,289
they're beating a dead horse just with

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,330
slightly different sticks that's not

00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:48,000
what you want right that's what that's

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,789
not what the engineers want they want

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,979
some variety in their job and you know

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:58,650
it sometimes it's just not happening

00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,599
here in this case what you can do as a

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:05,340
product owner you can give them the

00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:07,139
sense moving forward by moving forward

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,400
they need to realize that the work that

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,159
they are doing even though they're still

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,789
at the same at the same place just

00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:16,349
looking at it from different angles just

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:18,449
use your creativity to do whatever it

00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,000
takes to show them that they are in fact

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,190
moving forward you can do like a

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,560
checklist to-do list where they can you

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,979
know check off things that that they

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,229
have done at one point I came up with a

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:35,459
very creative idea that I unfortunately

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:37,469
wasn't able to put in place because like

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,169
a time but I had the idea of creating

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,750
like a battle map right so if you

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,760
imagine I don't know what what computer

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,990
game is cool these days

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,170
Starcraft right so at the beginning it's

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,840
not cool

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,730
right okay so if you imagine if you

00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,290
imagine that you start with a small base

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,270
that's where that's where you are at the

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,160
very beginning of the project and as you

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,320
move forward to you like explore

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,510
different different areas you know and

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,880
you can you can draw the map and then

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,220
you know as you go down that path and

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,780
explore whether it is something that is

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,630
feasible or something that you should

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:18,150
not pursue you can you can somehow mark

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,830
that on the map and the team will see

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,560
the maps growing you know so that's one

00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:25,140
of the ideas I had at one point so

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,980
really the message here is do whatever

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,900
it takes

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,150
use your creativity to make sure that

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,490
the team has the sense that they're

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:38,330
moving forward but there is another

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:43,530
thing about motivation in this face a

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:45,420
lot of work gets dropped because that's

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,510
what you do that's what research of the

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,340
state of the art is all about you know

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,070
scientists say that even negative

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,380
results are still results even twenty

00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,750
thousand of them

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,370
engineers often don't like that if they

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,260
if they do something if they work on

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,360
work on something and then you say okay

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,740
so we're gonna drop this work and we're

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,180
gonna we're gonna go in a different

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:13,050
direction it is it is not exactly

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,150
motivating so what you can do here is to

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,330
teach them with their managers

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:21,540
preferably that it is okay to fail if

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,170
you learn and by the show of hands how

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:30,300
many engineers do we have in the room

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:32,940
all right so the engineers in the room

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,290
and everyone in the room stand up we're

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,290
gonna stretch a little bit

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:47,300
and I want I want all of you there there

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,570
there will be three lines here on this

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:55,810
slide and I want you to read them with

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,810
me it's okay to fail

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,700
it's okay to fail

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:15,089
it's okay to fail

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:16,710
thank you you can sit down to let it to

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,600
let it sink for a little while I will

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,620
add one more thing again I will I will

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:26,190
repeat if you learn if you learn from it

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,110
it's okay to fail the reason why it's

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:32,100
okay to fail especially in agile

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:34,800
projects in agile projects when you fail

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,130
when you when you discover a wane word

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,930
which you should not pursue you waste

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,380
two weeks of your time

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:46,050
not two months not two years it is

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,810
easier to just try something and go back

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:55,920
then spend two months exploring and

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:57,660
analyzing something so another another

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,190
challenge that you can face as a product

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,830
owner you can face a like a like a

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,660
progress when the engineers don't feel

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,110
that they're making progress and they

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,610
can get paralyzed by analysis you

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,750
remember what what the previous slides

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,370
had kind of ironic isn't it because this

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,950
is this actually this is actually a

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,930
vicious circle because you know when

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,700
when your team when they are not

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,830
motivated because you know they're

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,330
analyzing the same thing just with

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,920
slightly different directions you

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,170
motivate them to keep doing that

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,940
eventually they they can get to this

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,790
place they can they can really get

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,240
paralyzed by analysis because you know

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,459
that they lose the big picture and they

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,200
keep focusing on the problem and they

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,230
analyze it from different directions

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,390
and well guess guess where that leads

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,580
they get demotivated because they're

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,860
paralyzed by analysis so you're back to

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,420
square one and it's really a vicious

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,839
circle to you so you really need to

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,370
break it on two on two sides I already I

00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,870
already told you how to break it on one

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,900
side or to break it on this particular

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,860
side is to give the team the guidance

00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,959
and I will I will go back to what Jen

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,930
said in a previous session where was

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,730
here in this case the best thing you can

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,860
do and the

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,680
thing for the team is to have strong

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,959
technical leader who can guide a team

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,940
who can make the decision who can make

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,860
the decisions if they need to be done in

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:29,389
case the team can't make the decision

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,820
themselves but if there's no such person

00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:34,430
if there is a no strong leader among the

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,120
engineers guess what you're the owner

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:40,190
you represent the voice of the customer

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,199
so you can be the leader you can give

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,810
them the guidance obviously I'm talking

00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,910
about guidance not directions you can

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:50,899
use directions as their as the last

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,880
resort if the team is really paralyzed

00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,070
and needs to move forward you can make

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,680
the decision but if anything before that

00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,610
you must give them the guidance that's

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,420
that's what you do

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,240
and by guidance it can be bringing

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,130
perspective to the table which was not

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,209
seen you know something something like

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,490
that that's what you do that's what

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,800
that's what's your role so don't be

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,649
afraid in participating don't be afraid

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,300
to participate in decisions that's

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:23,209
that's the message that's the message

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:25,550
here so as I said this is ultimately

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:28,100
where it leads the research phase leads

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,500
to some code somebody needs to write the

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,959
initial prototype and if you're lucky if

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,260
you're really lucky the team will do it

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,560
collaboratively if you're a little less

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,949
lucky the team will do all the research

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,170
they will connect all the dots and

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:48,050
somebody else there like one person one

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,000
single one single guy or one single or

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,130
one single one will take the lead and

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,709
write the code and here this spot I need

00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:02,569
to thank to all the over the weekend

00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:05,720
heroes who just go ahead sit down drink

00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:07,760
a ton of coffee and write it no matter

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,920
how ugly the initial code is they just

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,870
push it to the repository so that the

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,120
kit so that the team can move forward

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,220
and they can they can get the job done

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,050
or they can build on the code they can

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,699
improve it they can refactor it whatever

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,329
it takes

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:26,460
in in my previous couple teams I have

00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:30,300
worked with with a few of those

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,740
I don't know how they do it they just

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,750
they just do the rest of the team they

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,670
keep they keep arguing they keep doing

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,960
more designs but these people just throw

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,700
themselves and had the problem they

00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,340
write the code that's like okay now we

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:45,390
can work so if you're listening to this

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:47,610
presentation thank you so now you have

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:52,320
the code that means you have the first

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:54,870
prototype what starts is early

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,940
development because now the team can do

00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,270
the developers can do what they do the

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,970
best and what is usually the most fun

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:06,150
for them they write code

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:08,610
however for you your job now becomes

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,980
intense because now you need to take

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,270
care of the backlog I mean really care

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,400
about a backlog because you need to

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:18,300
write a acceptance criteria you the user

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,470
story so that all those things and some

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,480
of these things some of these challenges

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,620
that we'll see here are not specific to

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:30,230
this to this stage of the development

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:33,240
but they start here challenge number one

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,160
teamwork because what can sometimes

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,050
happen especially in a team that is just

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,960
forming is that the team is not not

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,340
actually working as a team I always say

00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,910
that there is a big difference between

00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,820
your team and a group of individuals who

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,020
coincidentally work on the same project

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,230
they don't share they don't share the

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,790
purpose they must they must learn that

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,190
what you can do here obviously you are

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,140
going to work with with their managers

00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,730
with your scrum master or agile

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,310
practitioner who whoever do you have

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,640
assigned to your team Thank You Fernando

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:09,689
and what you can do as a product owner

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,329
is push for higher effectivity and here

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,100
is here's what I mean by that as a

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:18,209
product owner you are an impartial

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,730
person who can observe and who can who

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,220
can point out the implications of the

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:28,380
decisions they that the people on the

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:32,010
team make as an example I once I once

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,890
was in a situation where one of the

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,830
engineers rather junior person he

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,770
spotted he was working on something

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,390
in a code right and he spotted while

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,550
working on that code he spotted

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,570
something that needed to be fixed or

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:49,250
refactored or changed dramatically and

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,280
he realized that it would take about a

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,490
week about a week to do that so he went

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,960
ahead and consulted with his more senior

00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,450
colleague one of the most senior people

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,160
on the team and together they agreed

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,810
that it's a good idea and that it should

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,190
be done straight away because it would

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,880
block them in the next in the next

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,310
spring

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,530
so they got that so they went ahead and

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,170
did that or ordered junior the junior

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:15,050
developer did that however at the end of

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,730
the Sprint I came to the I came to a

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,580
meeting and some of the deliverables

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,600
they were supposed to hand over at the

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,830
end of the Sprint they were they were

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,220
supposed to show at the end of the

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,520
Sprint

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,980
they were not done however there was a

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,320
ton of this artwork that was done and

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,310
nobody in the team except for these two

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:38,720
knew that this work was being done guess

00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:40,880
what as Jen said previously I didn't

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,610
hold the individuals accountable

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,010
I held the team accountable because they

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,720
as the team didn't deliver and I and I

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,000
pointed out to them and that's that's

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,490
exactly what I said I said that I would

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,530
hold them accountable as a team for what

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,500
they deliver not just as a group of

00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:59,810
individuals and at that point they

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,520
started to realize that they really must

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,500
work together because guess what the

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,060
worst case scenario is somebody else

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,650
could have spotted the same issue in the

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,960
code and two people could have been

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,220
working on this on resolving that each

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,730
one each one from a slightly different

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,530
angle

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,650
because well guess what they didn't talk

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,910
to each other right so as a product

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,530
owner this is what you can do this is

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,660
what you can this is what you can tell

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,090
them show them what it leads to and

00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:27,980
don't be afraid to take it to like

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,580
absurd absurd dimensions to really prove

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:34,220
your point

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:35,150
kind of okay so commitment that's that's

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,560
a big one

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,290
there are actually several several

00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,790
different parts of commitment what I

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,920
want to what I want to talk about first

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,800
is part time commitment happens a lot on

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,540
teams that are new because what often

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,309
happens is that your stakeholders your

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,409
sponsors they they

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,389
like give you some people you can work

00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:57,090
with but they don't assign them to your

00:19:54,389 --> 00:20:01,979
team full-time maybe like 50% if you're

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:04,259
lucky I witnessed a manager who assigned

00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:06,570
a person to my team to work there for 5%

00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,809
of their time it's like no thank you

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:14,759
it's really not even that that doesn't

00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:17,219
even cover the meetings so what you can

00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,710
do here is regular planning and

00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:23,879
communication with your with your

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:26,759
sponsors mutual respect is what you

00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:28,919
absolutely need to keep in mind you

00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,379
respect the sponsors and then they have

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,710
their lives and they have their

00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:36,749
recisions to make about about capacity

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,190
planning and they must respect you as a

00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,960
product owner they must understand that

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,489
you are here to deliver something and

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,259
that you're accountable for the success

00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:48,690
of the product and the project so as a

00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,849
specific example in one of my one of my

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,039
teams what we did there was at the end

00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,539
at the beginning of each sprint there

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,179
was there was a meeting where we planned

00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,429
the work that we were supposed to do in

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,219
the sprint at the very beginning of each

00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:05,489
such meeting we we did a quick round and

00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:08,039
each person in the meeting would say for

00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:10,259
how much they can commit to the project

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:13,409
in the next two or three weeks depending

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:15,299
on how long the sprint is and they just

00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,769
worked because you know you kind of know

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,919
what you can expect in the next two

00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:22,289
weeks obviously not in 100% of cases

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,879
because if CVE comes your way you need

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,729
to drop everything and you need to you

00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:29,039
need to work on that CVE so that that

00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:31,080
still happens but even with those in

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,969
mind you can plan up to 90 percent of

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,229
your time and you can work with that as

00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:38,999
a product owner you know what the

00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:41,909
capacity of the team will be our

00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:43,859
commitment that doesn't have to do

00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:46,679
anything with sponsors that has to do

00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:49,139
with the people on the team so there are

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:54,659
two types of Engineers at least in my

00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:57,989
experience those that tend to over

00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:01,649
commit themselves by under estimating

00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:03,580
complexity of the tasks at hand or well

00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:05,750
and/or

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,440
overestimating their capabilities or

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:11,330
well their Derrick capacity and the

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,150
other one is the exact opposite I will

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,610
talk about that on a on the next slide

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,650
so in case you have a team that tends to

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,300
over commit themselves you know put more

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,640
things on there a place that they can

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,710
handle what you can do there obviously

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,930
is a capacity planning and this is a

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,810
long run you need to start by collecting

00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,120
data and in my experience the team

00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,460
typically doesn't like that because well

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,430
they need to do some work on estimating

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,980
and they need to be they need to be

00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,870
consistent in their estimations and they

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,650
need to keep it keep it doing for weeks

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,360
and months but in time you will get some

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:50,180
real numbers that will that will show

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,000
you what is the real capacity of the

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,090
team and if they keep being consistent

00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,050
they eventually start doing the

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,880
estimates right or like if if they if

00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,920
they don't the estimates are still

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,620
relative to the capacity of the team so

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:10,730
you as a product owner can do can do

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:13,010
some real planning under commitment as

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,620
the second type of engineers that I have

00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:18,370
I have to work with in this case the

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:21,340
engineers try to well not try to they

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,780
unknowingly mostly unknowingly

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,610
overestimate the complexity of the tasks

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:31,940
at hand or they underestimate themselves

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:33,680
directly their capacity to do work so

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,310
what you can do here is have solid

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,710
backlog one other if you remember one of

00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:43,910
the responsibilities of product owner is

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:46,430
to build backlog if you don't do that or

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,470
especially at the beginning it is

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,860
difficult at the beginning of the

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,700
project because you as a product owner

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,830
don't know what's going to happen

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,210
exactly the product the project is still

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,740
fresh you should ask for help and by

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,780
help I mean the help of the engineers

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,750
because at this stage at the early

00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,280
development what happens what typically

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,430
happens is that the team is building

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,560
foundation on top of which the functions

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,600
will be built and building the

00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,910
foundation that's mostly technical

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,130
problem

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,260
you know there are technical challenges

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,630
so it very often happens that the team

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,270
knows much better than you what needs to

00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:28,420
be done in the next four five six weeks

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,880
ask them ask them ahead at a time it is

00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,620
much better than not doing them and

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,520
experiencing what I have experienced for

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,750
once or twice that the sprint starts

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,350
halfway through the sprint your team

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:43,420
doesn't have anything to do because you

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,000
know the sprint whatever was planned for

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,310
the sprint it's done okay what comes

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,450
next the backlog yeah there are some

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,520
things in the backlog there are not

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,040
exactly specified so guess what they do

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,340
the engineers do do what do they think

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,690
is best for the team and for the project

00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,790
at Red Hat we have a we have an

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,130
expression for that pizza we didn't

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,870
order product managers like to use that

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,060
and that's exactly what will happen to

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:10,450
you if you're if your backlog is empty

00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,860
and you know asking engineers to help

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,630
you with the backlog it will help you

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,350
with with one more thing which I will

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,450
talk in a little while and that is like

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,550
general communication between yourself

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,530
and the team because you as a product

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,970
owner also need to understand what's

00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,100
going on in the team what technical

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:30,150
challenges do they face because that

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,560
will help you understand their capacity

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,840
so now you arrive to the first demo

00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,770
something that you can actually show to

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,230
your sponsors and to your stakeholders

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:43,000
hopefully it went well

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,880
so you might not you must now push for

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,890
the release your development continues

00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,450
but you have one more one more

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,800
responsibility right now and that is

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,170
communication with the stakeholders

00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,390
because for the first demo you can still

00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:58,000
do that it still makes sense however it

00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,920
is only after the first demo when you

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,200
have something to talk to them about

00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,600
something very specific something that

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,110
you can have conversation about how to

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,090
improve it and also you need to start

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,560
prioritizing more because at this point

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,060
it's at this point where the

00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,110
requirements start coming from the

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,990
outside hopefully which is exactly what

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,120
the first challenge is at this point

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,680
feedback getting feedback it's you know

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,210
that the risk is that you will not get

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,920
any feedback or that you will get too

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:32,890
much feedback and when you are getting

00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,590
back in my experience with what you in

00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,720
the challenging situations if everything

00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,430
goes well you don't need to be too

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,080
assertive about in challenging

00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,070
situations this is the this is the best

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:48,060
answer I will talk about three specific

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:50,380
scenarios that I have that I have seen

00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,530
self-appointed stake holders that's the

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:56,080
first one so by the show of hands how

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,390
many of you encountered people who just

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,280
you know you presented something or you

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,020
were in a meeting and suddenly there was

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,300
this there was this one person who

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,040
raised hands like okay we definitely

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,740
need to talk because we're gonna use

00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,080
that or we're gonna depend on that or we

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,380
want to participate in this or something

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,020
like that so who has that experience

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:20,290
okay so about quarter that's not as bad

00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,270
as I as I thought so yes a

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,030
self-appointed stakeholders the the

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,480
danger there is that many of them just

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:32,830
want to be in everything

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:35,350
it happens now the question the real

00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,540
question is whether they whether they

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,810
have some real stakes in your project

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,620
you know being assertive here meaning

00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:47,260
means calling their bluff

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,450
ask them to tough questions why are you

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,830
my stakeholder what exactly do you want

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,050
to do you want to do with this project

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,820
why are you gonna depend on this what do

00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,680
you want to build on top of this you

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,210
wanna you want to participate great how

00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,280
are you gonna participate you know ask

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,230
these questions to make sure that people

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,580
who say your that there are your

00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,060
stakeholders are actually or

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,460
stakeholders there is another group of

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,490
stakeholders the group that you know

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:15,340
that they are actually your stakeholders

00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,810
but they don't talk to you they don't

00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,750
give you any requirements they don't

00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:23,130
tell you what they want you to do you

00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:26,830
can do here being assertive nag them

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:28,780
keep asking them for feedback keep keep

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,730
contacting them emailing them texting

00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,400
them I don't care having meetings with

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:35,740
them but whatever it works make sure

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,550
that you that they understand that you

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,620
need their feedback and there is there

00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,919
is a third group which is kind of

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,360
similar to this one

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,049
those are the people who who give you

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:54,279
their ideas and I have at least one

00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:57,690
specific person in mind this group will

00:28:54,279 --> 00:29:04,630
give you their ideas but then disappear

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:06,880
anyone experience those right and again

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,990
what you can do their communication over

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,909
communication basically talk to them try

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,549
to get try to get in touch with them as

00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:17,380
much as as you as you can and if they

00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:19,630
still don't communicate any of these two

00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,480
groups warn them that they will be

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:25,659
ignore if you nor if they don't respond

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,940
because like it is not up to you to fly

00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:29,559
to fly blind fold it right you must have

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,750
a direction if they want to be your

00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,980
stakeholders they must be active it's a

00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,750
two-way street but you know it does if

00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,850
all that works for you you should be

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,340
careful what you wish for because you

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,809
might you might get just that I get a

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:49,960
ton of feedback ton of priorities and I

00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:53,230
like I like what what Jen says it is

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,870
always awesome to have just one priority

00:29:53,230 --> 00:30:00,279
number one it doesn't happen that often

00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:02,700
right so there are there are two there

00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,500
are two things here or three things here

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,139
obviously you need you need a team to

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,669
follow priorities what can happen here

00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:13,480
either there they have too many

00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:15,490
priorities or they have no priorities or

00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,059
they're not sure what their priorities

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,889
are so obviously expectations you must

00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:23,649
set your expectations with the team you

00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:25,809
must keep communicating the expectations

00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:28,210
in my current team what I do every two

00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:31,779
weeks I sit down with a bunch of people

00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:34,269
from the team and we review sprint

00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:36,340
high-level goals not like those are not

00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:39,130
specific like what needs to be done in

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,779
every sprint but what I expect to see at

00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,460
the end of the sprint because it there

00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:45,010
are dependencies on something else

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,110
outside of the team for example so make

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,480
sure that the team understands what the

00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,730
expectations are and these expectations

00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,870
can be built up front we're not talking

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,120
like what are what is the expectation

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,980
just for the next spring but even for

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,040
the next one the one after that you

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,559
really go you know as much into the

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,179
future as you want as long as the team

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,830
understands that these priorities can

00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:09,040
change every two weeks that's why you

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:13,000
are agile right also having capacity

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:15,610
buffer helps because as I said in some

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,320
cases your team will not follow the

00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,179
priorities because they because they see

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,120
something that needs to be done to

00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:26,650
unblock them can be for example a story

00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,290
of this week in my team broken CI and

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,750
you kind of must fix broken CI because

00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,570
if you build your process around that if

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,520
your CI is broken you will not get come

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:39,520
you will not get any committing because

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:42,190
it gates your comments so obviously you

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,380
need to you need to fix that the key

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,820
there is that the team must tell you

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,320
first and foremost that you know

00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,059
something's broken and they need to work

00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,270
for it so that you can adjust your plans

00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:55,660
and as a product owner when you when you

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:58,840
plan you can do better capacity planning

00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,309
plan only 80% of team's time to work on

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,549
things that you want them to do

00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:06,850
leave those other 20% to these to these

00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:10,320
things such as broken CI or CVE coming

00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:13,770
in those things that you cannot predict

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,090
so the first change in direction

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,250
that's not exactly optimistic but it

00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:20,559
happens it happened to me every single

00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:23,410
every single time in my Starlin project

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:27,130
at one point the stakeholders came the

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,780
sponsors came and they basically said we

00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,600
don't want you to work on this anymore

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,820
you should refocus on something else it

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,350
does happen

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,179
guess what you're still getting to

00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,610
release there is no way out of it

00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:43,150
because your team hopefully continues

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:46,750
right and how it depends on how big the

00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:50,350
change of direction was you may end up

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:53,559
at the beginning because the direction

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:55,600
changes like really dramatically but I'm

00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:58,210
not rewinding my slides so let's let's

00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,730
assume that does not happen and let's

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,090
consider that the direction moves only a

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,120
little

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:07,720
or like moderately moderately that you

00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:10,299
don't need to drop all your work so

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,269
you're still pursuing the first release

00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:16,989
however your risk now is that the team

00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:19,749
loses motivation cause many engineers

00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:23,259
are on your team because they wanted to

00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:27,339
work on that specific project it happens

00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:30,879
it happens very often it can also happen

00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:32,859
that the that the team is demotivated by

00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:35,080
the by the change in direction itself

00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:37,299
because again it means that some code

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,279
needs to be dropped or some work some

00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:42,489
some research needs to be dropped or

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,409
something like that or they don't by the

00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:46,119
change of direction so there are there

00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:49,269
are two things that you can do here and

00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,889
that you should do here work with

00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:52,809
managers first and foremost because

00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:54,999
whatever you do at this point you will

00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:58,479
be stepping outside of URL a little bit

00:33:54,999 --> 00:34:00,279
so if you work with the managers to make

00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:03,309
sure that you need to understand how the

00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:06,639
team feels if the change of direction is

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:08,289
a problem or not if it is then work work

00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:11,020
with your managers we work with people

00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:14,049
managers so that you understand like why

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:17,849
they are upset what you can do as a

00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:17,849
product owner is showdown value

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,710
communicate why did it happen why the

00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,899
change of direction what's the value in

00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,819
the new direction what's the purpose was

00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:30,159
the new purpose of the team they must

00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:32,169
understand the team's purpose so that

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,899
they can align with that purpose and

00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:38,889
hopefully stay on the team if they if

00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:41,770
they by that purpose obviously in many

00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:43,329
cases the many engineers move away from

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,829
the project because they just don't

00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:48,129
share that purpose and that is okay

00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:50,500
because you typically want engineers who

00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,299
believe that purpose so make sure that

00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,129
you communicate that what's the value

00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:59,140
was the new value what is it that you're

00:34:54,129 --> 00:35:05,609
gonna deliver so you get to your first

00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:10,750
release you did it it's out you must now

00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:12,599
get your customers but as I said at this

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,549
point of your team is well established

00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,710
you know what your goals are the team

00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:21,130
the the team works like a well-oiled

00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,840
machine in which case I can only say

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,610
congratulations

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:34,570
good luck finding customers for your

00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:47,500
project thank you very much any

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:49,810
questions yes I'm sorry Wendy right so

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,030
the question was if I had the customers

00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:56,020
before or when I started the project

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:58,210
right so in those cases it can be

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,730
customers but I would more classify them

00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,350
as sponsors sometimes you do have the

00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,330
customers because you're creating the

00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,460
project for something very you know for

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:09,760
some for someone specific in mind so it

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:12,490
can happen but typically my experience

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,620
is that you have like certain type of

00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:17,140
customer in mind you know some some

00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,270
target group you don't have any specific

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,070
customers you just know who they are and

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,590
who will you talk to when the first

00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,560
release is out or when the first demo is

00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,390
out but it is always good and it's all

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,190
it's always a good idea to keep an eye

00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,470
on those and to make sure that you still

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,330
keep in mind who the target audience is

00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,400
and who are you going to talk to and

00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,990
basically talk to them as soon as it

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,000
does make sense you know many other

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,410
customers they don't want to see you

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,180
know sometimes they want to they want to

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,130
hear about the first idea sometimes they

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,680
want to they want to see the first demo

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,540
sometimes they're only interested in in

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,310
your first release so it kind of it kind

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,710
of depends and if you know who your

00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:57,450
target audience is you know being in

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,450
touch with them is generally a good idea

00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,400
any other questions yes

00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:17,010
right a great question the question was

00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:20,250
how do you decide as a project and/or

00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:24,180
product owner when it's time to call the

00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:27,030
project itself failure so two things I

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:30,980
was talking about mostly about like it's

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:34,650
okay for engineers to fail in a meaning

00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:36,240
finding a path which not to take right

00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,829
so that's that's one thing that is

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,809
absolutely okay to fail if you learn

00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:41,809
from it like I said as the scientists

00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:45,690
say negative results are still results

00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:47,339
however to your question I guess I would

00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,200
say that it's never fully up to you

00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:51,569
because ultimately you have some

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,430
sponsors you have some stakeholders so

00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:56,420
it is at this point it is about

00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,740
collective decision however you

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,750
obviously you are in position where you

00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,660
can give them guidance where you can

00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:05,400
communicate what your position is so you

00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,160
know when I don't see any any path

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,920
forward and I actually did that about a

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,760
year ago or two years ago we had this

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,730
project basically extracting extracting

00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,010
applications into into containers we

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:22,589
call them like giant macro containers

00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:25,980
basically like a BM like a container and

00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:28,710
so what I did there I talked to a bunch

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,799
of potential customers you know and when

00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,510
all of them unanimously said that this

00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:36,270
would have been cool if it came like two

00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,400
years ago now we don't need it at that

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,200
point I talked to I talked to my

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,980
stakeholders I talked to my customers

00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,589
well

00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,990
sponsors sorry and I basically told them

00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:48,089
like hey so I got this feedback I think

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:51,089
it's time to focus on something else or

00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:53,549
invest in to not in that particular case

00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,950
not in macro containers but go back to

00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:58,170
the drawing board and figure out how do

00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:00,930
you split up an application into into

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,940
micro services so that's basically

00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:06,380
that's basically how I did that but it's

00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,380
never fully your decision

00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:26,750
yep right yeah so the question was what

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,880
are one of the difficulties of well my

00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,280
specific case is that I'm a people

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,840
manager of the team as well as the

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,700
product owner of the team so what are

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,000
the challenges of that yeah

00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:41,150
so I would say there are more there are

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,270
mostly advantages because obviously you

00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:47,000
have well yeah you have more influence

00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:51,020
over the team obviously it's more

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,330
difficult to stay away from the from

00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,430
being the authoritative leader because

00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,830
well you have authority of two different

00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:00,980
roles so not to misuse that that's

00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:03,080
that's a huge challenge and other than

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,210
that I guess I guess the time because

00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,340
both people manager and product owner

00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:10,130
those are full-time roles and me being

00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:13,640
in two of them it doesn't make it easy

00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:15,380
so time is the time is the most

00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,840
difficult one and in my case how I

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,600
handle it is just that I try to delegate

00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,770
so I'm not the one responsible so

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,500
they're responsible for the product

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:26,630
backlog i partially delegate it to the

00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,160
team and I just I let them decide I

00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,930
basically give them the high level goals

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,150
for sprints and it's up to them to

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,830
decide how to gather so from that

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,900
perspective it actually kind of helps

00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,920
not to be the authoritative leader when

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,800
you don't have the time to be

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:46,430
authoritative leader you don't have a

00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:49,120
chance okay any other questions seems

00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:52,260
there are none so thank you very much

00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,260
[Applause]

00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,790
you

00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,790
