Title: How to Transform Dev and Test Silos into a Team
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: How to Transform Dev and Test Silos into a Team
Speaker: Stuart Corcoran
Description:  One of the foundations of lean/agile development is the elimination of waste, delay, and low customer satisfaction associated with siloed dev and test organizations. This talk describes how one software organization transformed siloed dev and test functions into unified teams focused on delivering value to customers. Attendees will learn:
-- why siloed teams are sub-optimal
-- how to plan for the transformation
-- the challenges to expect and how to overcome them
-- how the teams can evolve and grow
By presenting this information I hope to provide encouragement and a roadmap to teams facing the challenge of siloed dev and test teams, and call on them to start a transformation journey.
No limit on attendees.

hello

00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:14,750
okay I've got my work gear on you're

00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,250
here to work I've got you for 20 minutes

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,960
I'm going to try to deliver some value

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,400
my name is Stuart Corcoran I'm a

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,950
principal engineering improvement

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,649
manager at Red Hat which is just a fancy

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,649
way of saying I help teams with their

00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:29,779
agile and lean improvements I started my

00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:33,200
career as a developer back when

00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:36,170
waterfall was state of the art before

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,940
agile even been invented and I'm one of

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,120
the rare breeds that gave up a promising

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,640
development career to go into QA not

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,910
even QA but QA management and then I

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,370
spent 15 years building test and QA

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,770
organizations as well as technical

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,960
support boards been an executive

00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,480
management been in consulting in the

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,280
last 10 years I've spent in lean and

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,380
agile because having grown up in that

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,290
waterfall world I see all the benefits

00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:07,189
of lean and agile and I want to apply

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,469
them throughout the world so let's talk

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,149
about breaking down the silos and

00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:15,500
starting with a definition

00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:17,450
so silo or silo mentality means teams or

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,780
groups within an organization that won't

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,510
can't or are hindered from working

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,720
together in an optimal way I'm going to

00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:30,290
talk about why that's bad going to give

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,049
you some ideas about how to break down

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,939
the silos and we're probably even gonna

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:40,189
try to do a demo but you never seen that

00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:42,439
so here are the takeaways we'll start

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,420
with the end in mind as Stephen Covey

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,790
would say here's what I want you to get

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,490
out of it as my customers for this talk

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,920
I want to give you the ideas about how

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,590
to break down silos I want to give you

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,640
encouragement to persist in this effort

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:01,130
because it is hard work and I want you

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,250
to know that it's all about profit so

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,110
you may be thinking great that's the

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,420
name of the talk break down silos I get

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,939
it encouragement you may be thinking

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,129
that's a good thing I'll go for that and

00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:16,819
you may be thinking it's all about

00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:18,830
profit what or if you're like me you're

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,400
thinking when can I get out of here and

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:25,540
get a beer but I digress

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,549
so let's talk about profit the reason

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,709
why I talk about it is because this is

00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:31,780
hard work to break down silos why do you

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,870
want to do it you want to do it because

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,440
there's a profit motive and you want to

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,480
avoid riots I'll get to that so I think

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,150
all of you know this but let's go

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,930
through it anyway most of us are I

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,530
assume paid by companies to do good work

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,329
and keep you off the streets

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,470
companies need profit to stay in

00:02:52,329 --> 00:03:02,049
business cost by definition reduced

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:03,549
profit and delay increases cost delay in

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:07,659
delivering products and services

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:11,709
increases your company's cost and silo

00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:15,359
mentality causes delay so you got all

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:19,690
that logic so let's run it the other way

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:23,620
silos cause delay delay raises costs

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,000
cost reduces profits profits puts the

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,950
company out of business and you're out

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,639
on the streets riding and nobody wants

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,930
that so let's get back to the other

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,459
takeaways persistence I want to

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,530
encourage you to persist in these

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,120
efforts you've heard just the last talk

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,989
and other talks in this tract today

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,910
about teams that have gone through this

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,639
either this or other improvement efforts

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,139
and none of them happen overnight it

00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,120
doesn't happen like this you flip a

00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:56,620
switch the silos are blown up and

00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:01,440
everything's hunky-dory no it happens

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:05,260
more like this hard incremental work

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,169
chipping away at the silos and making

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,329
incremental improvements and that's what

00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,579
we want to do and what I'm going to do

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:15,069
is give you some tools like this big

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:18,549
construction crane to help you do that

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,109
tools on how to start tools on how to

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:24,190
address the challenges you might face

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:26,900
and then ultimately tools to succeed and

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,560
so if you can see down here

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,740
I'm this little guy with my vest and my

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,990
hard hat on trying to help you chip away

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,880
at the big silos and just by the way

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,790
backing up I've been looking at this

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,750
slide for about four weeks now and just

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:47,870
this morning I noticed that guys there -

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,910
odd alright so that's enough of the best

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,320
joke and I wore orange because I didn't

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,160
want anybody getting confused with the

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:58,660
yellow vest errs not one of those all

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,680
right so our next why we just discussed

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,990
why we want to break down the silos

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,910
because of the profit because you don't

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,850
want to be on the streets rioting but

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,639
why do they cause delay well it's

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:14,240
because they lengthen the feedback loop

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,210
a silo lengthens the feedback loop all

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,190
right let's start the demo here now you

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,310
may have seen throughout the the course

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,990
here of the two days people trying to do

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:31,250
demos you know and you think they're

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:35,450
brave doing a live demo excuse me I have

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,669
a cold but have they ever tried to do a

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,460
live demo they thought up in the middle

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:43,550
of the night before being jet-lagged and

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,610
awake and using volunteers that they've

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,860
never even talked to before that takes

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,380
guts but we're gonna do it so I need two

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:57,740
volunteers one for an easy task

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:59,060
and one for an easier task okay I got

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,340
one volunteer here

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,440
well if volunteer there you want easier

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:10,190
easier easy easier task is you're gonna

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,500
time this test loop okay so when I start

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,289
just look at the clock see we're going

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,010
and just when we get done with the

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:20,900
passing of the test that's what stopped

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,539
the easy task is you're the tester I'm

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,630
the developer you're up there near silo

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:29,180
I'm down here in my silo so I've been

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,969
working on my product here here are the

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:36,740
requirements I'm putting them in my

00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:40,640
container

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,950
look containerized and I would toss this

00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:48,230
but my box got broken it would all fly

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:55,280
off so this all goes up here to that

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:58,910
silo and you start testing while I go on

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,240
to the next thing on my to-do list all

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,460
right

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,350
dev and test feedback loops and by the

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,410
way when you're done you know just throw

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:09,670
it back over the side of the wall the

00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,290
feedback loop for Devin testers is

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,030
important because that's how you get the

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,790
best product the best quality product

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,800
just to have good feedback now the only

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,780
reason there are silos between dev and

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,670
tests is because there are testers and

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,820
the only reason there are testers is

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,310
because you can't the developer can't

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,170
get the best feedback themselves it's

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,330
just human nature that if you have

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,940
created something that you are not going

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,730
to be the best one to objectively look

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:41,480
at it that's why you need the tester for

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:43,970
that unbiased perspective so that's why

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,410
we want those guys that's why we need to

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,550
have that information go back and forth

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,860
now when you have a silo it takes a long

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:56,450
time to get that feedback to get that

00:07:51,860 --> 00:08:00,200
information and it causes delay and why

00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:04,420
does it cause delay well because of

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,380
context switching and context loss okay

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:10,120
so when you're in a different

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:13,270
organization as Devin test often are

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,610
they're often not sharing the same goals

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,970
they don't have the same tools they

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:22,990
don't have the same priorities and they

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:26,000
are therefore usually going to have

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:30,760
miscommunication misunderstanding and

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,760
all of this is going to cause delay

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:43,940
really okay well excuse me while I

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:47,280
switch context my product is back sorry

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:53,250
sorry I'm being delayed in delivering

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:55,920
value to you the test failed four sheets

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,530
not three pigs zero and four have two

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:04,830
fuel line segments hmm

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:10,020
okay I don't get it guys obvious an

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:13,770
idiot but he's in another silo I don't

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:17,400
know who he is and I don't care but I

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:23,640
can't move on with a failed so I'm gonna

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:30,120
call him up and I'm gonna say and you

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:33,600
kept my pin to damage I will just have

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,840
to I will just have to IRC not enough

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,840
information

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:49,210
all right I call up my tester say hey

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:51,910
Chester what's your name sweet tee' good

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,990
to know your sweet tea I got the bug

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:58,030
report seemed to be misunderstanding

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,550
here could you could you tell me your

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:05,910
the requirements three sheets of paper

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,910
got it

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,620
each cheat must have symbols on it got

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,620
it

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:22,800
each sheet must have fine line segments

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,800
symbols straight line boy got it and

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,890
know what aren't there isn't there

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:33,690
another one I've got for a circle symbol

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,690
counts as two line segments

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:42,460
what what what version and requirements

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:48,370
are you looking at well weren't you at

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:53,380
the meeting this is v2 all right thank

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:56,350
you you get the point so context

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,730
switching where was I I was on context

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,670
switching just when I had to switch

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,560
context you all know this you're doing

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,540
work you get a bug report you have to

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,730
drop it you're doing figure out what the

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,860
code was that you're working on fix it

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:13,240
send it back go back to what you're

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,670
doing very time-consuming causes delay

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,860
and of course open source world is worse

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,470
because you have the extra benefit of

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,570
another silo if you will

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,790
upstream you you gotta send it all up

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,400
there get the patches are viewed comes

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,990
down then it goes to test and you see

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,840
the point just gets longer and longer

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:36,000
and so we want to do is shorten that

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:39,490
feedback loop as much as possible so

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,680
sweet tea you know I think we should

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,680
break silos come on down

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:58,410
all right I've got a version three now

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,830
of the requirements why don't why don't

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,850
we talk about it work together so here

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,950
they are should be three sheets right

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,990
should have symbol on it right each

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,370
sheet must have seven lines they're up

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,240
and the ante

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:18,480
there should be no zeros and a plus

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,930
symbol counts as three okay so let's

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,930
code again I'm gonna start coding here

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:28,740
you take that and you start testing so

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:34,170
what was our goal seven all right I'm

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:38,460
gonna code one two three four five six

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:42,810
seven why don't you test that one two

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:46,890
three four five six seven don't you test

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,020
that one one two three four five six

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,870
seven

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:58,380
good how about that one one two three

00:12:51,870 --> 00:13:00,960
four five six seven eight oh ah

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,760
there should be no zero some really snow

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,890
zero so we have to do all right

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,430
but we're right here so I can just fix

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:11,880
that how many is that one two three four

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,460
five six seven three sheets I'll have

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:20,370
seven and we're done how long did that

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:24,560
one tape four minutes versus half a

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:30,180
minute all right excellent eight to one

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:33,030
thank you so there a demo a demo of

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,420
breaking silos and how it improves so

00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:39,210
shorten the feedback loop is the key of

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,500
why it causes delay or that's what you

00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,560
want to do it cause the cause of delay

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:47,640
all right on to the tools so how do you

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,220
get started everything is about

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,820
communication understanding each other

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,130
so one way to do that to get started is

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,649
to set a common high level goal

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:02,420
so you want to set a goal that is

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:05,810
customer-centric one such as deliver

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:08,519
high quality software to the customer or

00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:12,149
deliver value continuously to the

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,480
customer or complete all of the elements

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:18,540
of definition done on this feature

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,720
notice they are not goals like you know

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,569
land on the patches upstream a developer

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,569
goal or deliver this feature to test

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:30,209
that's a developer goal or test all the

00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:33,180
code a tester code or find as many bugs

00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:36,389
as possible a tester code now those are

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,300
fine sub goals but you have to have this

00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:42,600
overall higher customer centric goal

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,490
that you both work toward you both agree

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,839
we're not going to be done until we hit

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,069
that goal second tool in your toolbox is

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,410
walk in their shoes

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:59,029
that means understand each other's

00:14:52,410 --> 00:15:02,370
processes their tools their environments

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:04,860
their priorities that they're getting

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,850
from their management and talk about

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,680
those and then the key is just don't

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,170
discover them as you're making this

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,829
happen actually plan to educate each

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:18,720
other on it set down and say here's all

00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:21,180
of our stuff here's all of your stuff

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,579
let's look at them see what is common

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,949
see where we're going to have issues and

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:30,149
fix those upfront or at least try to

00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:34,889
mitigate them upfront and of course if

00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:37,500
you can merge those together as best you

00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:40,769
can especially at the goal level again

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,279
and then always retrospect on a regular

00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:46,980
basis so that you know that your work in

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,560
understanding those goals is having

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,040
effect that you are actually

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:57,829
understanding each other and not having

00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:00,990
miscommunication and finally I guess I

00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:02,029
highlight this one is of course it's all

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,269
about people

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:07,650
so we are not teams of automatons

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:10,220
everyone's an individual

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,720
and again if communication is the key

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,210
then you have to understand how

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,100
individuals communicate you have to

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,470
understand their communication styles

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,660
their learning styles their

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,320
communication methods and tools or

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,529
preferences and ideally understand their

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,960
motivation and again this gets to if you

00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,000
have a separate organization you know

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,089
there might be motivated from above in a

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,640
different way but again be transparent

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,860
get those out in the open to say hey

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,920
this is how I'm being motivated how are

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,589
you being motivated and then do your

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,690
best to mold those into a common

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:52,830
motivation that you can both share and

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:56,100
so the key is just to intentionally be a

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,050
team not just hey we want to be a team

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,230
but you have to do things you have to

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,300
take actual actions upfront to become

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,240
that team and this is some of the ways

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,250
to do that

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,439
it's all next challenges that you may

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,100
face there are many but here are just

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:17,640
three first distributed teams so teams

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,819
in silos are often organizationally

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,829
distributed and usually in an especially

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:27,270
an open source geographically

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,920
distributed I mean that is the

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,400
definition of open source right they're

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,760
distributed teams so some of the ways

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,370
you can address that are meeting in

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,910
person as much as possible now it's

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,640
often a challenge but do the best you

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,820
can at least think about trying to meet

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,700
in person on some sort of cadence if

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,309
it's even annually if but if more would

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,610
be better and that's because of the the

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:59,610
nonverbal communication that happens in

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,860
communication so the degree that you

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,220
can't do that then use video

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,559
conferencing and turn the video on okay

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,440
I don't know how many video calls I've

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,030
been on and there's no video on if you

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,880
turn it on it's not as good as

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:18,210
face-to-face but you still can get some

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,830
nuances of the nonverbal communication

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,610
out of that so I encourage you to do

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,889
that

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:27,669
finally time zone overlap is another

00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:29,559
issue so try to discuss with your team

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:33,070
upfront how you're going to address that

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,950
you can do like regional meetings with

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,700
teams that are timezone compatible and

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:43,659
then have a a communication in between

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:46,110
less frequently my colleagues Neil Smith

00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:49,389
and Chuck Coppola did a whole

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,850
presentation on just this topic so if

00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:54,820
your red hat employee you can find that

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:58,090
link online if you're not Neal's right

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:02,110
there so hit him up for it all right

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:05,500
another challenge management support so

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:09,009
in my experience there's several kinds

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,409
of management support full full semi

00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:15,039
full and semi semi so what I mean by

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:18,789
that is full full you have top-to-bottom

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:22,360
management support of your effort to

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:24,909
break silos and the team sees the need

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,580
for it and is fully supportive of well

00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:31,029
it's the best case scenario I've only

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:34,360
seen it once in my career and despite

00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:38,830
that it still took two years to fully

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:43,059
break down the silos and and realize the

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:46,509
the positive results from now semi full

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:48,789
this is management is not supporting

00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:52,000
this but they're not you know

00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:54,730
prohibiting it either but the team sees

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,610
the need and they're on board and trying

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,950
to do it and that's fine as long as you

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:03,490
have two teams that are going to do this

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,190
they can take those tools on how to

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,929
start and start working on it and then

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,539
start communicating that up to their

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:14,889
management to see tell them see how much

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:17,799
better this is if you do have management

00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,870
that prohibits this effort well it's a

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,200
different talk but it's a much shorter

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:26,139
one get a different job and then there's

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,830
semi semi so this one is there's

00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:32,290
management support sort of there's team

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:36,390
support sort of

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,390
this just means there's going to be

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,800
managers that are very enthusiastic want

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,540
this to happen there are teams very

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,050
enthusiastic and want this happen and

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,970
other others that are like yeah I'll

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,680
participate but I'm not really into it

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,660
that's fine too

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,720
I mean those teams are enthusiastic

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:59,890
again can just demonstrate to the others

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:03,550
how well this is going to work and then

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:06,790
a final challenge is all teams are

00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,260
different that's not I mean it's not

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,780
really a challenge it's just a fact

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,640
right well it's all about people all

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,810
people are different so the teams are

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
going to be different their

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,690
characteristics or interactions are all

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,640
going to be different

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:24,280
the challenge is don't force uniformity

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,890
don't make all the team's do something

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,050
the same way don't make them all break

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:32,200
down their silos exactly the same way

00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:36,580
let them find their way what is the best

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:40,660
way that fits their team so those are

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:45,400
the challenges how do you succeed back

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:47,470
to persistence you just need to persist

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,800
in these efforts because they do take

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,470
time I heard Rasheed yesterday you

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,080
should Khan talked about their efforts

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:59,680
they took its he told it said it took

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,240
them four years you heard earlier an

00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,770
effort that there's ongoing at 16 months

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,130
none of these improvement efforts happen

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:11,620
overnight but one way to persist to help

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,870
you persist is use an improvement cycle

00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,040
and there are lots of different

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,720
improvement cycle names there's

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,510
plan-do-check-act plan do study act

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,420
they're all the same I cut mine down to

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:26,340
just three experiment learn and adapt

00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:30,760
and I like experiment better than plan

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:32,830
because a plan usually if a plan fails

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,960
that has much more negative connotation

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,500
than if an experiment fails an

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,790
experiment by definition is you don't

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,590
know what's going to happen but you're

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:45,059
going to try something you got to try it

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:47,549
short-term and you're going to try it

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:50,480
and learn from it see what you learn and

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:53,159
then adapt excuse me

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,590
adapting can be hey that experiment

00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,889
worked great let's expand it to other

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,950
teams or let's make it part of our SOP

00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:04,350
it can be well it didn't work exactly

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,080
right but it didn't completely fail and

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,679
we see where we could tweak it so let's

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,350
adapt it run another experiment or of

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,049
course there is you know there can be a

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,259
this totally failed but like we heard in

00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:21,539
the last talk you know there's you know

00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:24,830
no experiment as long as you learn from

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:30,080
it you learned a way not to do it okay

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,080
so that's how you succeed just persist

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:39,259
so let me sum up first can somebody tell

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:44,759
me the name of that formula that famous

00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:48,029
formula no I don't know what it is I

00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,509
just googled the sum there it is I don't

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:54,720
think it's a famous formula at all

00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:57,149
summing up breaking silos reduces delay

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,629
which increases profit which keeps you

00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:03,299
from rioting reduce delay by shortening

00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:07,379
the feedback loops between Devon tests

00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:08,240
or any siloed groups and it's all about

00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,509
people

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,460
increasing the communication reducing

00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:17,610
misunderstanding reducing misconceptions

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,220
that all cause delay do that by

00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:23,309
understanding each other's goals your

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,570
processes their tools and try to make

00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:29,820
those common as much as possible

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:34,919
don't force all teams to do it the same

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:38,519
way and in the end persist just keep

00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,619
trying stuff use an improvement cycle to

00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,019
get you there you don't have to get it

00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:46,799
all in one Big Bang you take it in

00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:49,919
little incremental steps so that's why I

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,240
have I'm not gonna have time for

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,680
questions but I will be around if you

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,480
have any and if you didn't get anything

00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,140
out of this or didn't take away any

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,480
ideas then at least we can go have beer

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:10,599
now

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,599
