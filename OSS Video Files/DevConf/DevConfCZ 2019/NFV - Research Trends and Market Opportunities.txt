Title: NFV - Research Trends and Market Opportunities
Publication date: 2019-03-04
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2019
Description: 
	Presentation name: NFV - Research Trends and Market Opportunities
Speaker: Muriel Franco
Description:  Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) decouples packet processing from dedicated hardware middleboxes to Virtual Network Functions (VNF) running on commercial-of-the-shelf servers. In this sense, NFV helps to provide service delivery with accelerated time-to-market and agility while reducing both capital and operational expenditure. NFV has been attracting attention from both academy and industry not only because of its technological potential, but also because of the economic opportunities around such market, which include the offering, distribution, and execution of VNFs. In this presentation, we will review the NFV market and highlight how the academia and industry have been explored this. Also, we will present some state-of-art solutions that can contribute to large adopt of NFV.

hello hi everyone my name is Maria Frank

00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:14,230
I am a jeweler desert at inverse of

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:18,130
Zurich and I have I have dedicated my

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,320
time interest about NF UV issues and

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,589
problem densification the best five

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,749
three years party brazil's part inverse

00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:27,970
of zurich in switzerland and the media

00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:30,599
of this talk is it is literally

00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:36,510
territory and try to to highlight some

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:40,510
research trends in academy about other

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,949
issues and also try to identify some

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,510
Fotolia jaraxxus for NF UV at all so

00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:48,670
here we have a brief agenda about this

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,379
presentation first i will to do some

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,039
basic concepts about computer networks

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:56,079
and NFV

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,050
in to do some general child's since when

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,100
if he was release it that is well

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:06,970
sparked during the last years and I like

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,770
the research trends by using an I'm at

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,880
those two to investigation I also

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:19,000
provide some market opportunites

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:22,600
regarding the the market often if you

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,200
and conclusions try to highlight and

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,460
forecast some some things about how an

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,670
if we can ever root and large adopted

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,280
the next year's so first we need to

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,460
define app based concept from competing

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,990
networks if use what is it looking to

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,810
based I can define that and the trapunto

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,590
is a network node or a fiscal harder i'm

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:51,130
the box or if i define behavior for

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,230
example week it can be a simple IP kippa

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,750
tables

00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:59,340
baited file or also are complex network

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,870
accelerator or compressor for example

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,530
when i use it for yourself connect the

00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,500
network serves google netflix are so and

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,660
so on the the user connection is for

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,900
audit between different middle box that

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,470
can be added gaya fire o

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:21,209
you know our fight ourselves later a

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:24,060
load balancer and so on and what is the

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:26,610
probability the box it most most of them

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,400
is very expensive it's not easy to

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,099
manage and make some configuration

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,680
operations where we have a lot of middle

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,849
bots to manage that you have to expend a

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,840
lot of money with team to to go to to

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:44,700
make some hacks to correct some problems

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,579
in the middle marks are to manage or to

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,549
deploy these know what's the most of

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:53,640
time is very expensive so forth Eastern

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:58,920
if it has immersion as a summative

00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:01,799
technology that not only reduce the the

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,370
cost and simplify the management but

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:08,730
also allow us to make some evolution in

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,890
network or the base in a few and if we

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,519
allow us to neutralize sessiontoken

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,829
choose move down from middle box ditch

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,239
getting robots to run in any kind of

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:23,940
virtualization solution so it is other

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,069
good opportunity about cost reduction

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,389
and provides some agility and

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:32,400
flexibility regarding NFV guide networks

00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:36,060
at all for example one of the main

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,310
benefits from NFV the agility and

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,599
flexibility we can for example make

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,400
available ourselves that service our

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,709
network future to supply some specific

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,340
ambience in few seconds and also we have

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,280
flexibility to such a location and to

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,459
configure network service until future

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,690
to supply a specific demands for each

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,120
user

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,940
I've also still attempt to mark for

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,010
example we can develop the talk future

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,980
and make it available for a customer or

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,829
end users have provided in few second

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,220
houses and of course we have we can

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:17,609
reduce the cost not only the capital

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,269
cost because you don't need to buy

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,270
middle box more we can use

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,629
come come out off-the-shelf service and

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:28,289
had us reducing the operation expensive

00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:31,090
because we can use for example

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:34,270
autonomous astronomer platforms or

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,789
solutions to deal with a lot of food to

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,580
the same time and to deal with a lot of

00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:42,009
information that will be available for

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:47,349
management orchestrate such Network

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:50,379
printers so anything is very nice okay

00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:52,090
we can reduce costs ahead as a retailer

00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:54,610
to mark the spirit but it's not simple

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,789
to do is not only with allies and I took

00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,550
from joined it we works fine to compound

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,259
the service or to provide a complete

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,680
service

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:08,349
so if what I acquired many to provide an

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,719
efficient deploy of such my nads turkey

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:16,030
straight and also manage such via nerves

00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:20,830
yeah physically wait so for this NFB

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,860
each idea was released by a CSI that is

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,130
European Turkish understood so to read

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,360
it as a white paper in 2012 and says

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,849
that a lot of standards and the parts to

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,779
define which we need to implement any

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,870
free environment

00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:40,210
I was really is it I can highlight one

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,599
of the most important in my opinion that

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:47,500
was the first use case for an FV that

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:50,380
was released in 2013 it was basically to

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,009
us five use cases which includes the

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,330
utilization of mobile corner towards and

00:05:54,009 --> 00:06:00,909
content delivered networks so we can

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,919
make evolution the core of networking to

00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:05,560
the edge of the computers of the

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,529
computer networks in the same year the

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,759
concept architecture of an SUV was was

00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:14,979
release it it is the basically it is a

00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,930
stone that we needed to fall to

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,289
employment or to permanent solutions

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,349
that will deal with

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:25,229
and pedantic functions at all

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:28,770
in 2014 the mesh dimension the

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:33,389
conceptual framework was proposed by 80s

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:36,449
nihilism I can see that this framework

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:40,139
is the base for any solution regarding

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,349
management position of Venus both to

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,229
Academy and also to both to Academy and

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:48,659
Industry so we need to use this

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:54,300
framework as base to build some solution

00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:57,569
to to manage the case weight set here we

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,680
have the cattle the concept architecture

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:05,159
of NFV so we had basically NFV future

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,339
that is compounded by a substrate of

00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:12,569
transition layer you have the transition

00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:16,379
resource and the VAF is hosting up to

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:19,649
this any future have a limit management

00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,899
to do to provide some API is to

00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:25,439
communicate other sources with the VNS

00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:28,439
and the most important I can say that is

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,999
the district components that is with

00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,430
compound and management occupation

00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:34,860
manage the physical frame work let's do

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,889
castrate the next manner and the deficit

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,909
or ecological managers the orchestrator

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,709
is in charge of a global management many

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:46,229
focus on resource management in service

00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:50,519
management definitely even if manager

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:54,449
cultures of their life cycle of IVF and

00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,309
the fertilizer super manager this is in

00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,059
charge of call to the resource

00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:01,740
allocation and of the

00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:04,490
refused to do so

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,009
the jockey for example can be

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,499
constructed using different open source

00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:11,610
frameworks and platforms available for

00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:13,800
example you can construct energy

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,939
infrastructure by using open stack or

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,959
open delight or others no solutions and

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,699
we have a lot of well-defined frameworks

00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,309
to manage orchestration

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,159
for example can I can say the OpenStack

00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:30,430
stacker that is a good solution because

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,010
we have a food

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,970
a integration a good integration with

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,590
OpenStack translation so he was up a sec

00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,530
attacker for a separate orchestrate and

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,230
imagined in the ABS that is running

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,720
OpenStack basic transition system type

00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:52,060
of open-source woman that was released

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,940
in 2014 it's a very can see a very nice

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:58,120
project about because about management

00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,700
position of lives have open bottom and

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,310
of course we have all relevant solutions

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,610
for energy beam already available for

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,710
example installation maintain the

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,990
European a 50 project which is a

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,540
collaborative platform for developing

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:17,410
and evolution of an SV is a consortium

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,860
of a lot of a different scope resource

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,220
companies that is trying to provide

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:27,540
Anderson chief the evolution and

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,330
adoption of anything larger scale so

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,030
okay now there is some Chinese for fuv

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,700
that have been sports since it was

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,710
released by think it is this child's

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:43,030
place about magical situations and

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:44,830
security in mind we can and our eyes and

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,640
have some ideas about the current state

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:51,760
of the art about NFP well first of all

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,900
first of them there is a classical

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,610
problem for energy that is the placement

00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,890
basically the question is where is the

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,790
best place to deploy I've been asked

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:05,560
recently way of course for example you

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,170
can change one or Marc

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,100
Venus to build a complete servicing and

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,590
is not a trivial issue because we need

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,390
to know where is the best the best few

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,520
suitry are the best place our best

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,460
technology to use for circuit compound a

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,940
secured cells you can deploy a file a

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,160
dpi on the IPS for example okay how can

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,550
apply search network puntos such

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,950
meanness to construct ourselves so we

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,320
need to take into account some reported

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,900
important issues about latin sequence of

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,850
service e as a resource available and of

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,160
course monetary cost that is one of the

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:46,260
main issues

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:48,450
about us in FB other important challenge

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,470
in general chimes is the mention of case

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,390
manager in the person of Jesus for

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,670
example how perk wrist straight and

00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,610
month or surgery knives we need to build

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,130
some monitoring solutions api's have a

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,940
lot of challenge and space for works in

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,320
such area and when we can be grated for

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,890
example how to identify some his

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,600
behaviors for some problems in the FIA

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,450
as I've seen they're sexy food to Cheney

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,370
to Noah I need to be great search in

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,360
half because this is a bottleneck in

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,340
their selves at all very important

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,710
questions and a lot of techniques to

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,380
identify these behaviors bottlenecks and

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:31,710
other when affinity bubbles have been

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,410
exploited by Academy most of them I

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,940
usually I try to use artist intelligence

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:41,070
and information visualization to the

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,930
detect identify such problems and other

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,120
important question of course as computer

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,360
networks at all is security we need to

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,930
provide tres communication among in a

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,440
few components I mean their case to 800

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,210
F manner for example can be placed in

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,990
our infrastructure and needed to manage

00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:03,750
and castrate the nerves or composition

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,750
of being s that can be deployed around

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,030
the globe in interfaith history solely

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,810
to provide a first communication between

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:15,960
such components it's a issue that I

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:19,620
think requires attention in terms of

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:22,740
security and the table interoperability

00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,560
among different values is very important

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,260
because for example if I develop a

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,780
vignette and iPads develop other Vinnie

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,500
F and I want to use both mean F to

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,960
compound the Sara CE and I need to I

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,330
want to open stack tackle for example to

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,720
illustrate sojanet I need to provide to

00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,740
ensure that different winner

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,779
different winners from different vendors

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,449
will be integrate and have until

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:51,420
we focus extact aphorism so it's a

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:54,120
important passion also we need to to

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,230
guarantee also mental ability interrupt

00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,180
interoperability between for example

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,790
legacy net Network room tools I can use

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,100
for the parameter box to put in the

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,050
middle of a sexy I've been a FM in the

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,129
Box the bayonet for example how it can

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:14,060
works so it is kind of an questions not

00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:16,829
only about security but about others

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:23,639
issues and of course we have treats and

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:26,819
the countermeasures I think as and if

00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,769
they arise as a a solution and a real

00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:33,689
solution I think a lot of new tweets

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:37,019
will be arise and the condom users to to

00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:41,129
deal with such new tweets is a challenge

00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:44,540
to the next few years for for deal with

00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:50,850
some security aspects about energy and

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:53,100
anything environments at all so now we

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,120
highlight some you need files and

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,339
research trends finalize a lot of

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,720
important Congress and conference in the

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,319
computer networks and to protect

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,170
management I can invite three main

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,610
research trends in computer networks

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,750
after his manager frustration related

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,589
issues that is a vast

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:18,329
Avicenna of products will have 5eg

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,750
anything as I enable for 5g networks is

00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:24,809
a really important aspect also there is

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,839
a lot there are a lot of concerns about

00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:32,129
that and business models to to build a

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,410
lucrative and profitable market to

00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:37,740
market on scape to any thievery in the

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,689
future so ok

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,170
one of current research talk related to

00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:46,559
management official framework is how to

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,520
detect when F performers and identify

00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:54,160
bottlenecks

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:57,399
service Foucault changing for this we

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,010
have a lot of works academy exploring

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,040
the album color solutions to take this

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:06,580
problem for example we have an FB perf

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:12,720
that was proposed in fes the end of 2016

00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:16,089
3 years basically it is a solution that

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,850
makes an performance monitor and what

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,459
makes detection to mean NFV in the SF

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:26,589
sees at all it basically is nips packets

00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:30,160
and on our VM to VM communication path

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,630
computes the delays it reports and use

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,990
these measurements to identify

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,940
bottlenecks in real time other solution

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,180
for example is the per track that was

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,610
proposed in your work published in the

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:46,390
network and management conference in the

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,640
past year study team such a work

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,680
monitors the elements of the software

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,079
data plane and provide performance

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,420
reports for example graphs and

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:58,920
initiations to highlight bottlenecks

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:02,140
into the NF l-- it serves other

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,899
conjugates to solve this kind of problem

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,180
that is identify performance bottlenecks

00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:10,510
I can say that is machine learning based

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:16,120
solutions we have a lot of works in this

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:18,220
direction for example this work that was

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,529
published in communication magazine in

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,020
January in the past year so the authors

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:27,959
this exclusive the whole that machine

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:30,490
learn can play the regarding any issues

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,920
the Otto's highlight for example concert

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,810
opportunities by using network

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,589
machine learning to failure prevention

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:43,120
detection of degradation patterns in fvn

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:45,160
able to works and I can say that there

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,100
are a lot of opportunities that you can

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,760
sprawl by using machine learning to

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,709
identify patterns and misbehaviors yeah

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:59,339
I sexy are you

00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:04,490
Venus for example in the other work

00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:09,240
published in the network support in 2018

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:12,150
our work to identify who is beauty the

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,199
SFC was proposed this work proposed

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,600
adapt achievability

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,160
based on linear regression and neural

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,260
networks to adduce the model parameters

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,260
according to environment articles for

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:29,970
example you can use the type of image

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:34,260
the number often veiniacs SFC to to

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:37,830
train to teach the algorithm the how it

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,480
can detect which is the guilty for a

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,150
bottleneck or misbehavior or above

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,080
performs or a problem performance near

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:50,850
SFC so there are a lot of opportunities

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,480
in such a director is it other important

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,040
point that we need to cause there is in

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,910
management orchestration of VNAF

00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,190
services

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:03,330
the composition office services how can

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,490
I create a servicing a composition of

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:13,049
Vienna apps to provide a service in a

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:15,179
secure adaptive way so there are some

00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:18,330
works in academy that are trying to

00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:21,809
solve this problem and for example we

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,820
have we had an additional ET puis

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,860
communications magazine in 2017 a

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:30,360
framework to facilitate the development

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:35,880
of new vehicle components if you focus

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:38,660
on SFC it was proposed as as a

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:44,669
demonstration I also have a scenario a

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:47,220
user case this different algorithm for

00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:49,740
VF placement can be compared by using

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,730
such solution and also adapted to meet

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,900
some

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:57,990
sexy high dynamic demands so it is a a

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,760
very nice world to know about the Nook

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,110
is a critical position other work for

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,120
example is open atrium

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,730
let us publish you seek call thousand 18

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,799
I can say that sitcom is one of the most

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:12,030
important Congress in computer networks

00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:14,900
around the world they open at UVM which

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,360
is an open source in every platform to

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,240
generate the social development of

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,660
software based networks at all was

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,890
presented as a demo also so it was

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:32,100
implemented in the demonstration was

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:35,460
provided and basic open at UVM creates

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,860
abstraction layer over DP decade to

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,559
allow the chain of via apps running the

00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,470
same host I can say that the unique

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,470
invitation limitation all the pin

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:49,890
dependence of this work is the work

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,710
proposed that it's obligatory to use

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,820
docker but its own dependence it's not a

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,160
limitation of course not

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,190
I definitely choose docker can use

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:04,860
docker and create a high-performance

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:07,710
AMSA chains in Fe so all the relevant

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:11,120
issues regarding SFC construction is the

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:16,860
validation of such a substance that was

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,690
created for example I mean when I talk

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:23,040
about validation is how can I validate

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:26,850
that SFC is running as proposal as

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,700
promised it and how to guarantee the

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:34,040
integrity of the packets that are being

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,990
for other between the SFC

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,980
fabulous we had different kind of works

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:42,059
for example head SFC path to excel that

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,360
enables the education of problem

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:49,470
SFC and simplify the configuration by

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,580
using visualizations to demonstrate to

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,690
show the whole path traveller said by

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,289
packets nia given

00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:02,100
SFC such work was developed in the HP

00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:05,130
Enterprise the sofa Brazil so I can say

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,889
that it's a kind of - from industry to

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:13,529
validate the solutions that have been

00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:16,019
developed in HP for example other works

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:18,419
that helps during the validation of

00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:24,000
collation of services was presented in

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:25,230
netsoft 2018 that is contained in at the

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,620
cotillion height was proposed for

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:32,179
support in the creation and low-cost

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:35,669
cushion to validate a hybrid asepsis

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:38,279
composed of both contain debated and

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:41,070
built on machine basis Vinnie F so we

00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:43,169
can create for example assertion yet but

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,710
I petted was bailed fire running water

00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:49,320
and deep irony I will go to Ubuntu VM

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,610
machine for example so it provides some

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:57,629
iteration ability to create SFCC

00:21:52,610 --> 00:22:01,019
different technologies and solutions and

00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:02,970
other important thing about that's a

00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,730
very general problem is placement

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:13,080
migration and resource allocation by

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:15,600
consider s FCS or being apps there are

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:20,039
lot of problems try to solve the problem

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:24,299
of perforation resource management for

00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:26,490
example we have IP hyper energy V that

00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:29,549
was proposed to my mice the lattice ring

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:32,639
when running large numbers of vnf in two

00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:35,490
days it and every fish to tree it was

00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:37,970
published in 2017 and we have for

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,370
example in October

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:45,360
starting with ET puis communications

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,700
ladders we have a work that provide

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,549
algorithm for the cloud and been teefed

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,679
her location would provide me free

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:55,710
environments that was proposed take into

00:22:52,679 --> 00:23:00,100
account different refugee cause this is

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:02,840
authors in this in this paper this world

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:07,510
and provides some some results that

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:11,750
demonstrate that this world can save see

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:17,020
65% more in terms of money to apply

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:20,180
Avenue F in the future regarding the

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,610
main compartment compared with solutions

00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,100
that doesn't doesn't take account for

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,800
the suspects often FEV so we can use for

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:31,460
example algorithm for cloud computing of

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:34,760
course - the solution for Venus but it's

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,710
not so efficient when we can use a lot

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,970
of information about the nf environment

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,590
to try to identify and to provide which

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,530
is the best way to put it in air for

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,540
example so it it's a very important

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,480
question to to do about resource

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:53,210
management for a specific demands and

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:58,430
particular tips Pudge squads of end

00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:00,230
users and vennett demands and as if it

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:04,010
has a strong economic at puke

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:09,410
of course cost and energy savings I one

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:12,050
of the main goes to the next years so we

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:15,140
have different works trying to to

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:18,950
address and your saves and cost emphasis

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:21,770
for nfu one of in this world for example

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,770
the ultra sophisticated how to add a vnf

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:27,590
into a existing service chain you might

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:30,320
not impact negatively in the future cost

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,870
so if you have a SFC for example running

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,590
the same host office which provider you

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:39,350
need to put other vnf in this SFC how

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:44,050
can put this to not impact or not back

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:46,240
to much in the net costs are in the

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:49,510
economic aspects of this research

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,650
provided other works are focuses almost

00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:55,510
injury issues regarding energy physics

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:58,600
for example in there with National

00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,640
Conference on communications in 2018 our

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,250
work that joint authorization of vnf

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,990
placement in the traffic routing for

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:10,120
energy efficiency in telecom networks

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:12,940
will propose it I can say that currently

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:17,290
telecom networks is one of the most

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:19,630
interested in energy savings for by

00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:22,210
using FEV because of course there are a

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,090
lot of opportunities to make innovation

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,280
and evolution the network core that is

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:32,470
directly related to telecom networks

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:36,610
provided so also there are several works

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:40,260
focusing NFV potential as a neighbor to

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:43,120
5g networks of luggage cart

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:46,540
therefore Academy and Industry are

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,440
interested how to use next before

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:53,920
supporting NF e v8 IOT and edge accomp

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,710
you team as well so in this way there

00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,920
are thoughts mainly to to build fully

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:04,600
frameworks for management and deployment

00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,610
of vineyards to sustain 5g networks in

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,190
general view I can say that this works

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:12,730
are splitting networks elements into

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:16,780
Vienna's to address the demands of 5g

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:19,950
Europe for example to provide new travel

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:24,490
rapid applications and dynamic resource

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:26,559
allocation for 5g and IOT devices or

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:29,950
applications in the talk for example

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,610
published general past in the I Triple E

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:36,880
communications others purchases could

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:40,780
discuss a real risk of additional micros

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,420
daily energy as a player that evolves

00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:46,040
the social location and orchestration in

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,110
a cloud enable a to assess

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:53,450
to work they can't account the dynamics

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:59,270
of 100,000 of persons movement in

00:26:53,450 --> 00:27:02,300
account event so season fu v and v EG

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:05,390
the networks are becoming a reality I

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:08,870
think a lot of Newport UNIX and child's

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:12,800
I measured together and one of these

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:15,380
child is how to provide performance to

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,220
to sustain or to address the new

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:25,340
applications v EG yeah it is the year

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:30,050
for example conference our work to

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:32,600
provide Putra ultra high quality which

00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:34,700
media by creating a few basic dynamic

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,060
adaptive streaming season would propose

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,340
it

00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:42,350
we have other works trying to to take

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,210
with some issues about edge computing

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,250
for example this world collages are

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,920
adapted f UV technology form of

00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,280
biological beauty and allocated cloud

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,620
computing features near the base station

00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,160
of edge versus networks which resulted

00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,910
in a extremely fast and a service assess

00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,190
to user equipment and we have other

00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:07,490
proteins about opportunity no chance

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,620
about business perspectives I think

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,820
business models should be included in

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:17,540
the next few years there are a lot of

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:20,210
preserves in such direction the current

00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,630
works I'm trying to propose business

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:26,930
models based on how to fix it price and

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:31,160
pay-as-you-go such models are inspired

00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:33,680
well now crowded models however I think

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:38,900
a lot of new information from being apps

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:41,720
and it users demands must be considered

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:45,710
to explain a few ineffective way to

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,760
create business models and put different

00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:51,410
kind of players to support the market of

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:55,430
anything and if there's a service for

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:58,130
example is a hazard stop right now there

00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,710
are a lot of works trying to provide not

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,320
only

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:05,700
f as assets but also in vista to tree as

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:10,290
a service to support research VDS so if

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:13,110
it's to supply is a position such as top

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:18,060
right now in this bush instantiation of

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:20,610
Venus as a service also is a very talk

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:25,140
we'll have for example two projects in

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:32,370
lava project and fent project was really

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:34,130
easy to do basically to provide aware to

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,720
provide a place where end users can

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:39,060
purchase of any available in a catalog

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,260
for example then the search of an F can

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:45,840
be accentuated in a few minutes remotely

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,410
or yeah if used to be provided by the

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,470
user

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,620
I mean the idea is that end users can

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,620
buy via apps in a similar way that

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,060
currently smartphone users can buy

00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,630
applications in every store or google

00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,870
play

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:04,770
I'm pad a film project is a project that

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:07,830
is supported by Brazilian government our

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:09,630
main main tensions in faint projects is

00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:13,260
to propose a any vehicle system that

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:16,740
simplifies not only the process of

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,680
acquisition in stitch association but us

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,260
the management of within apps for this

00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,080
we introduced the marketplace for Venus

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,170
where inducers can for example by a

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,240
vignette and we can list and change any

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,820
age by using OpenStack stacker you know

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,730
if you suit really provided by us as it

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,990
used to be suitably provided or for our

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,580
draculina future

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:43,410
that client can provide the conditions

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:46,650
for us for example so okay so taking

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:50,190
account these challenges closet and

00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:54,090
search trends and assuming that most of

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:57,030
them will be solved in the next few

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,040
years I can say that then the market

00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:03,520
often if these value what you need for

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:06,610
the future today we have

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:10,120
up to five billion of dollars being

00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:13,779
spent in FEV at all for hardware

00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:19,419
software and so on and based on

00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:24,340
different could parts for NFV in 2024 we

00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:26,799
will have up to 71 billion of dollars in

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,659
NFV market at all

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,880
for example the acquisition of been apps

00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:34,299
others to believe enables if researchers

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:38,770
and operations connected to manage to

00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:42,820
castration of such environments will be

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:45,490
one of the most part of such amount of

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,860
money so a consumer captor should should

00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:52,179
be also invested also four steps

00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:58,770
training for example to be great a model

00:31:52,179 --> 00:32:07,929
as they for to network for NFV models

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:12,970
today we have for example so in this

00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:15,970
table we can see which is the best actor

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:18,000
that is most interested in energy and

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,710
invest more and have good solutions

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,279
first sector of course we have 80

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:27,429
sectors and telecom providers of telecom

00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:29,440
networks followed by bank and financial

00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:31,929
systems and healthcare

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,100
I think us there ask that in the next

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:39,600
years and the government can be a good

00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,490
player for nice vehicles of the IOT

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,149
evolution smart series and a lot of

00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:49,120
opportunities to use in fuv as enabled

00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:52,419
to sustainability communication between

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,529
different different sectors in smart

00:32:52,419 --> 00:33:00,010
cities for example today most of such

00:32:56,529 --> 00:33:02,260
values is explained with hardware of

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,000
course to create native environments

00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,929
which software to management and

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,510
orchestration and not much is spent with

00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:13,029
service but I think in the future this

00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,669
amount which sells can be improved

00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:17,710
because as an SUV

00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:22,389
becoming a reality I think a lot of

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:24,639
innovative services or VF we arise and a

00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:26,470
lot of money can be spent for example

00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:31,090
for developers that create a knowledge

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:32,739
of service it can be paid to network

00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:36,429
operator by such vf2

00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:37,499
to find a specific demand or to for

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:40,480
example

00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:42,759
hands this venoth pay-as-you-go I don't

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,289
know but I think there are produced to

00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,279
developers to create knowledge of

00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:50,049
services in future and we paid for that

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,999
so now I will talk about some market

00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:54,279
opportunities regarding even as a

00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:56,259
service see if you still supply as a

00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:00,789
service between ourselves of course and

00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:04,450
smart cities in nineteen up occations so

00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:06,340
first I believe that and if it is

00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,679
ourselves or vnfs ourselves is the

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,720
defeat tree I can say for example a

00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:16,750
model where developers can develop

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,429
innovative services for example I as a

00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:23,369
researcher can develop innovative

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:26,290
services to view if DDoS attack I

00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:29,579
construct our services by using our IP

00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,960
tables file a dpi by using network

00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:33,909
neural network models I don't know when

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,319
I can create and I can put that in a

00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,799
market place for the baccarat log of

00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:41,859
being yes and one operator that has a

00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:44,859
specific demand can contract

00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:48,069
I don't know can buy or current search

00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:52,780
Vienna have so there is a lot of produce

00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:55,389
to developers be situated to develop new

00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:58,900
new innovation selves innovative

00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:02,349
services and but that available to any

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:05,530
user and use interested in users of

00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:07,420
course can be one of the most benefited

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,160
by that because can contract cells on

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,950
demand on my network is under attack

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,260
right now and I know that the guys from

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,569
the reserves from the MIT develop a new

00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,970
solution that can be deployed as a

00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:22,100
venial to solve my problem ok who

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:25,010
contracts a service for example for

00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,140
it's only to mitigate the attack so

00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,810
there are a lot of poets and when we

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,360
talk about NFV and vineyards we are

00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:35,840
talking about a few minutes two seconds

00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:39,290
to have such Network food to deployed

00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:42,230
and available for our network inception

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,260
providers can explore such market by

00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:47,630
building a bit profitable business

00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,580
models to offer this boot and also

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,590
managers such reenacts for example to

00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,710
orchestrate to the text and problems

00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:57,110
behaviors in tois to ensure that they

00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:00,260
which the inducer will contract will be

00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:01,730
delivered for the such a - such a few

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:07,130
users so there are a lot of cartoons

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:09,830
also and if it stirs supply is other

00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,450
interests report win it because the

00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:16,640
purpose of a suit is to host Bill

00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:18,770
Knapp's is is not a trivial issue so as

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,650
there will be a lot of B&S available

00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:23,510
eventually for example at recuperator

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,270
will not have any free environment

00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:28,580
configure it to the place which Venus

00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:31,130
Durst fvv Sutra must be available as a

00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:35,240
service so can have a versatile provider

00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:38,150
that make a completely free environment

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,970
available to sustain or to host have

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,300
enough contract by individual it is very

00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:46,490
similar to putter form as a Mizzou SS

00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,850
and microstructures root for example

00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:51,530
however Pakistan Navy and if you sue

00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,380
tree should be able to do with others

00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:58,060
metric reasoned aspects to meet

00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:01,280
particular demands of each peach user

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:04,910
and for example if the student profile

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:09,230
it can can make available some specific

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:11,810
military solutions and no plataforms to

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:16,450
a problem identification specific for

00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:21,020
each case or if demand of end users and

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:23,630
so that last but not less important

00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:28,510
scenario that can be spartina lucrative

00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:32,090
way is there are a smart seeds I think

00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:33,460
any produce described it before is valid

00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,950
for this

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,590
as well developer and service providers

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:41,290
if we can provide just a my solution

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:45,400
supply different areas is much see and

00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:48,040
provide ultra-high Motilal a things for

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,790
example occasions inopportune services

00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,100
for example developers can good

00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:57,040
solutions to issue a licensee and

00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:59,890
reliable if you suitors for vehicle and

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,870
towards health care for example we can

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,930
make available solution are in pursuit

00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,670
to sustain vigil surgeries which reduces

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,640
costs so there are a lot of

00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:13,120
opportunities made for developers and of

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:16,500
course for as much series and digital

00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:20,620
sites at all

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,750
so for the future I can imagine that and

00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:26,740
if you will be fully operational in the

00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:29,800
next next few years by integrating FV

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,810
and software file networks as the end we

00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:36,310
can provide for example a lattice and

00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:38,620
dynamic application firstly to end-users

00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:41,350
and semi provides or for the network or

00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,760
to create innovative community different

00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,420
kind of communication innovative

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,310
applications if you do hopefully of

00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,320
course cyber attacks will become more

00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,400
complex and sophisticated when we have a

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:57,910
lot of network food to Victor is a

00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,340
beautiful eyes again a lot of issues

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:04,090
related to security will be require

00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:06,390
attention actually should be combined

00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:10,030
with all the technologies to improve

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:13,060
capacities I can say first of the hype

00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:15,670
of bug chain is a a beautiful finish to

00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,850
take a sum in fuv child's regarding

00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:24,880
accounting and billing for example

00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:27,370
currently I'm working at UC 8 ya option

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,140
basic solution for infrastructure is

00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,290
supplying using block chains mud

00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:37,120
quarters for example if I end user needs

00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:39,040
to contract a vania if I don't have to -

00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,400
horses in the F we can use a kind of

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:47,529
automation solution I use a block chain

00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:51,309
- to realize do not require centralizing

00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:53,569
solution so I think there are a lot of

00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:59,180
opportunity by using blockchain but

00:39:53,569 --> 00:40:03,640
other kind of technologies to be be

00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:08,299
measured with NFV to solve some problems

00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:10,039
is to open and I can say that more

00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:11,599
solutions to simplify okay

00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:18,470
to simplify the management and

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:20,829
orchestration of vnfs NFV or SFC will we

00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,480
arise because we will have a lot of

00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:26,359
number of being apps and we need to

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:29,119
manage and orchestrate such - so I think

00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:31,759
artists intentions is a good opportunity

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,049
and information session as we have in

00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:37,130
computer networks and computer

00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:38,980
management - to provide highlights for

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:42,829
in Jerusalem network operators

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:47,690
identified yeah easily in fast way some

00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:51,730
problems can be a good forum for entity

00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:54,619
in future so that's it if you need some

00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:57,739
system of the reference I will make

00:40:54,619 --> 00:41:02,150
available the conference all the things

00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:05,890
is here and that's it if have some

00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,890
patients who have few minutes

00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,740
yeah

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:24,169
[Applause]

00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,040
[Music]

00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:44,120
so we need to provide

00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:57,590
[Music]

00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,750
yeah we need to provide such a bouquet

00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,750
you can use

00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:04,000
you have cancer

00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:26,750
most of Arsenal's use physical force

00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:29,960
they see me safe see the a unique if it

00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:33,200
suited them but if you for example you

00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,549
need to have VfB run in Brazil or there

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,500
in Switzerland in water cleaning check

00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:48,529
for job and you need to complete that

00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:51,430
how can I do it's a problem I can say

00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:54,380
for health care for example main is to

00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:56,750
to provide a fish to tree to supply

00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,809
healthcare communication I owe t a tower

00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:35,259
so if we will be use it to virtualize

00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:35,259
some some some some 50 pressure I can

00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,389
