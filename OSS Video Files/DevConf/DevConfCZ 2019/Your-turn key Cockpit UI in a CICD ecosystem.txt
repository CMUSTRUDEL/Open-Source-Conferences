Description: 
	Presentation name: Your-turn key Cockpit UI in a CICD ecosystem
Speaker: Martin Pitt
Description:  Cockpit (https://cockpit-project.org) and its builtin set of UIs for system 
services has become an integral part of Fedora Server, RHEL, and is included in
all major distributions.

It has always been very simple to create your own interfaces using Cockpit's
API. But it is a big step from some quick HMTL+JS proof of concept towards
maintaining a production-grade project with proper integration testing/gating
and fully automatic delivery. This talk introduces the tools and services that
the Cockpit team offers for developing your Cockpit extensions, which gets you
there right from scratch.

	00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,700
thank you everyone can you hear me

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,849
alright also on the back roads okay nice

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,369
so yeah I'm Martin fish I work in a

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,349
redhead soccer team and yeah I'm glad

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,730
that so many of you made it here at this

00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:24,119
early hour even though I'm competing

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:28,160
against an wash so welcome to DEFCON Phi

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,439
suppose yeah so I want to start this

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,750
with a 10 second history of cloud

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,149
computing at the beginning we had

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,329
infrastructure-as-a-service

00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:40,679
AKA my other computer as a data center

00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,910
then later on we got

00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,920
platform-as-a-service

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,690
so this must stuff like open shape the

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,050
open stack to manage all these extra

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,079
computers that you had and on top of

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,760
that then we got software servers so for

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,199
example we don't host Alvaro and repos

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,789
anymore like everyone just use this

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,219
github but ultimately undeniably the

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,960
pinnacle of evolution is cockpit

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,480
continuous integration and deployment as

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,159
a service and obviously it cannot get

00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,049
any better because you were just one out

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,329
of breath trying to pronounce it and

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,409
this one is is what I want to introduce

00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,750
today but let's start with the with the

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,159
first world cockpit so I hear that

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,360
there's still people around you don't

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,750
know what it is so let me quickly

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,280
introduce that conceptually cockpit is a

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,829
Linux session that runs in your web

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,840
browser so technically it's very similar

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,299
to what happens when you log into your

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,969
machine with SSH or on the virtual

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,430
machine a virtual terminal or if you

00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,920
have a desktop and log into gdm it took

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,979
No so this is like yet another way to

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,439
work with your server and it is aimed at

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,659
administrators which are new to Linux

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,149
for example they come from the windows

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,320
world and they are familiar with the

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,119
like with the concepts of system

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,850
administration but not necessarily with

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,770
the Linux terminology but it's also

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,850
appealing for experienced administrators

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,890
particularly for doing infrequent tasks

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,109
like if you only set up a radio a once a

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,149
year like you really need not going to

00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,950
remember all the command line for it and

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,710
it's much simpler and safer to do it in

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,690
a graphical you are in it guided way and

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,520
thirdly it is a great troubleshooting

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,450
tool so whenever you have a bunch of

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,830
machines you

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,440
can drill-down into the cockpit

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,170
interface and into all the details and

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,060
see what is wrong with this machine and

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,860
it it's just an apt or yeah more DNF

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,099
install away from like all the major

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,330
distros fedora atomic rail Debian Ubuntu

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:39,120
Arch and others so what does it look

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,500
like so this is the system page gives

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,650
you summary information about your

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,920
system of course you can drill down into

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,870
a lot of extra details here and the menu

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,870
on the left that shows you like the

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,099
available administration pages and you

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,069
can also switch between multiple

00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,890
machines here for example this is a sub

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,569
page anyway this is the sub page of

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,260
networking which allows you to control

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:06,480
the firewall at the UI for firewall D or

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,390
you can interact with your local libvirt

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,060
or overt virtual machines and get

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,209
consoles and configure disks and so on

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,530
and the cockpit team maintains all of

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,700
these pages that you see in the menu

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,709
here but of course there will always be

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,859
things that are missing for your use

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,799
case so corporate was designed from the

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:31,889
ground up to be extensible and we do

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,079
this by offering a JavaScript API which

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,500
you can include in your page and this

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:39,540
offers you API is to and to do stuff on

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,180
the connected machine like run a program

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,400
or connect to a D bus service or open

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,019
files and sockets and like all the

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,850
things you need to implement

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,840
functionality so a very little example

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,170
often-cited

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,450
we want to create a UI for ping so we

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,260
could whip up a little address so we set

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,019
up an address input vine and a button to

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,910
actually do it and here we have a little

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,310
summary status whether it succeeded or

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,880
failed and a little preview can watch

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,150
the output and we can wire this to the

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,729
corporate API so this is the interesting

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,299
bit here so we can use cockpit spawn to

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,220
run a program and whenever something

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,490
happens in standard out you can output

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,580
it to our like streaming elements and

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,990
whenever the process finishes then we

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,940
set like the status field

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,740
of course this is slightly simplified so

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,190
far of course the error handling case is

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,139
missing but this is the gist of it and

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,240
so there's a very similar structure for

00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,150
like doing a D bus call or opening the

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,130
file for example so initially it looks

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,039
like this you have a new menu entry here

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:56,470
you see our input line you click on ping

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:58,900
and you see the result and yeah so it's

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,270
mostly basi expect and it appears in

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,620
that menu with a very little declaration

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,039
thing which we call the manifest but

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,870
it's not terribly interesting here and

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,880
this is actually good enough if you want

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,250
to set up like a little page for your

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,470
own personal environment like you have a

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,509
company specific page or you want to

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,919
have a very cheap way of monitoring or

00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,220
controlling your service in your

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,250
household or whatever but as cockpit has

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,419
become more and more popular like and

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,009
there is more and more extension

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:31,659
projects which are public these projects

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:35,590
they become much larger than this little

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:38,560
toy example for example there is no UI

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,830
for Putman or we have a user interface

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,090
for building installable images

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,940
operating system images which is called

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,099
cockpit composer or there's user

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,469
interfaces for setting up in IPA server

00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:53,110
or fleet commander there's been ideas

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:55,449
floating around for setting up and if a

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,440
server or certificate management and so

00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:01,210
on and if you do this scale then just

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,840
tossing all of your code into a single

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:07,270
HTML is just not good enough anymore so

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,490
in such like public public and

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,310
officially supported projects you want

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,800
to have a clean separation of HTML and

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,530
CSS and JavaScript put split them into

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,880
multiple different modules and of course

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,740
you don't want to cobble together the UI

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,690
by hand you want to use modern

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,870
frameworks like react and pattern fly

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,300
and once you do this then you need a

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,759
whole JavaScript tool chain to compile

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,169
all your files and to essentially a blob

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,930
that the user can understand

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:37,150
and these build systems they get very

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,250
complex very quickly and even for

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,669
experienced developers it's a big

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,710
annoyance to set up shut them up and

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,729
once you have this you also want to make

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,879
causal tests

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:50,979
make sure that your your project keeps

00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:55,360
running over time and you want to test

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:57,219
it on various operating systems and also

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,229
you want to make sure that doing the

00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,809
release is very cheap so that you can do

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,150
it very often so essentially push button

00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:05,800
release process and putting all of that

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,839
together this is a daunting task and we

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,719
know that and it might help might

00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:14,229
prevent you from like starting this

00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:15,969
project so we came up with a project to

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,580
help you with all this which we call the

00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:20,439
starter kit and this does all the glory

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,740
that I was just talking about with you

00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,779
having any video not having to do like a

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,999
thing and without having to learn about

00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,999
all these gory JavaScript tool chain

00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,219
projects so it is essentially a

00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:35,430
collection of best practices for modern

00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,930
JavaScript and for corporate development

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,330
and it provides a little example UI

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,610
which you can just clone and then rename

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,259
and you can start hacking on the react

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,949
pages in the code without having to

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:49,449
worry about all the boilerplate and so

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,249
for example you can run make the eval

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,339
install to run it straight out of your

00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:56,439
build tree or you can of course to make

00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,449
install to put in it to use a local or

00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,959
you can build an RPM and then install

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:04,060
that and whichever way you decide to do

00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,759
if you do this then you're getting UI

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,999
like this of course that's like rather

00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,830
boring looks and spectacular but it

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,479
already demonstrates like the cool thing

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,659
of what you want to do on a cockpit page

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,789
so for example this uses a cockpit dot

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:21,849
file call to read it's the host name and

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:25,300
then show it on the page and so the idea

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:28,149
is that it's ready to hack on react

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,499
component and you can then build

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,349
whatever you like without having to

00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:36,729
worry about the tool chain or testing

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:38,169
and testing is a good a good keyboard

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,000
here because this is something that a

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,039
lot of projects also struggle with and

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,410
this is also why the starter kit

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,199
contains one of contains a browser

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,529
integration test so again if you run may

00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:52,410
check here that looks very simple but it

00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,130
does a lot of stuff for you in the

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,899
behind the curtain

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,730
for example the downloads in the

00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,379
appropriate operating system image from

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,779
our servers like in the

00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:03,759
case it's round seven six but we have

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:08,109
like lots of images for Debian Ubuntu

00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,910
Fedora CentOS you name it and it builds

00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:11,799
your code installs it into that virtual

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,919
machine starts a headless chromium

00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:18,429
browser and runs your tests there and

00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,959
then gives you back the result and this

00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,909
we uses the virtual machines that we use

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,489
in the copper team ourselves to test our

00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:27,099
own product yep yeah own product and

00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:29,259
believe me it's a half time job to

00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,509
maintain all these so if you possibly

00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:35,439
can then we use these images instead of

00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:37,569
trying to maintain your own thanks and

00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:39,659
so of course once you have these tests

00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:42,579
you also want to integrate them into

00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,499
your CI so for example when your project

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:46,059
gets in your pull request you want to

00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:49,539
make sure that these tests actually run

00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:52,419
and you can actually do this so we offer

00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:55,599
it to projects to run your tests on our

00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:57,519
infrastructure of course you have to go

00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,649
talk to us first so that we make sure

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,899
that the project is reasonably sane and

00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,039
of course we need to control like what

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:05,679
kind of rock loads goes on our

00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:09,269
infrastructure but yeah if you ask us

00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:12,759
nicely we will figure this out for you

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:16,959
and the next step would be the automatic

00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,339
release process so the idea of how we do

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,739
the lists in the corporate world is

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,929
essentially that you come up with a

00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:25,149
small list of changes and then put them

00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:26,709
into a sign tag on your project push it

00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:30,419
and then everything else happens

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,649
automatically like for example building

00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,529
released our walls putting them on

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:38,529
github building a source RPM pushing

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,089
them to fedora or copper or updating

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,429
your project page for the latest

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,919
documentation and whatnot or pushing an

00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:47,919
image to dock up and we have a lot of

00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:51,429
little helper scripts which can help you

00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:54,009
with that so for example this is and and

00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:56,439
this is controlled by a little like

00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:57,819
shell script which we call core pitches

00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:59,859
beliefs and that needs to be in your

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,199
project and with that you can tell the

00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,779
released machinery like to which targets

00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:06,549
you want to release your project so the

00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,649
real file has lots of comments of course

00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:12,400
but I hope if you look at it you should

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:15,850
get the gist of what is possible

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,620
and just like with CI I mean you you you

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,900
are welcome to run this on our

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,970
infrastructure if you talk to us and we

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,710
can set this up for you so help you with

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,600
set up the web hook for your project and

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,240
as soon as you push the tag with the

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,779
release out for you but unlike with

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,250
running the tests this part is actually

00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,940
relatively easy to sell first if you

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,860
prefer that

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,200
like in essence it's just a container

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,820
with a bunch of tools that you need for

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,830
doing all this and a bunch of

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,470
credentials so that you can upload stuff

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,300
to copper and github and whatnot and if

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,370
you want you can just run this on your

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,350
own laptop as well so push the tag and

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,270
then just run like cockpit release wanna

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:58,000
point it to this control script and it

00:11:52,270 --> 00:12:01,810
will do that for you as well and if you

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,089
do this you get also some extra bonus so

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,760
in the corporate team itself we do a lot

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:09,640
of routine maintenance tasks in an

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,950
automated way for example you want to

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,260
regularly update keep your NPM

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,740
dependencies up-to-date to pick up bug

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,630
fixes and security updates or you often

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,680
need to upload the latest translation

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,380
templates to Donata

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,360
like the translation platform or and of

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,770
course download the latest translations

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,410
into your project so that you can

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:32,650
actually use them and we have pots for

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,080
all of that so this is an example that I

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,180
bought it again starter kit itself so we

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,550
see there was a new react package

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,529
available and so the bot comes along and

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,770
updates the version of reactant or

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:46,600
package JSON and then runs the test

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,150
against it and we see it's all

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,760
hunky-dory and then in the end the human

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,190
person can come along and say yeah this

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,320
looks sane or maybe well this was

00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,750
pattern fly it might have been visual

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,480
impact so let's give it another manual

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,700
test and then sign off and land so it's

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,279
basically the the minimum human

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,640
involvement to keep your project alive

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,640
and healthy

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,449
so and this this is not a pipe dream so

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,220
the we have a bunch of projects which

00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:24,519
are real life which use all this

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,220
machinery for example as I said Coptic

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,529
composer of apartment / s3 they all use

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:35,319
that independent projects which make use

00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:37,120
of our infrastructure welcome so and

00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:40,060
let's add your project to that list so

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,459
the idea from our team is that we can

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,470
only scale so much so we cannot become

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:46,600
experts and like for all the subsystems

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,360
and technology in the world but instead

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,810
from building all the us ourselves we

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,019
want to help you with building your UI

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,389
for your project and so we work a lot on

00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:59,920
our CI infrastructure to make sure that

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,470
it's scalable and generic to other

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,019
projects and we do cross project testing

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,819
and of course we are very happy to work

00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:08,819
with you to set all of this up with you

00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:13,959
so if you want to talk to us so we

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,750
usually hang out in each cockpit on

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,420
freenode and our project home page has

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:23,079
pointers to the mailing list and to lots

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,910
of documentation and tutorials and of

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,920
course why we are here please come and

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,350
join us in person

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,920
so we have a hack fest and that happens

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,060
Sunday 1430 so it's not that long so

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,860
actually it's more like a meet-and-greet

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,560
but still please tell us about your

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,670
project and ideas and we can answer your

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:47,439
questions there also if we are currently

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:49,420
doing user interface user testing so if

00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:51,639
you want to go down the hall and need to

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,740
lovely people there like Mary and Jen

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,860
for example you can also help us with

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,600
improving the current user experience

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,100
with corporate and composer itself and

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,649
just say hello well thanks for your

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:11,100
attention so we still have some minutes

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:11,100
for questions left so are there any

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:25,730
and hey microphone can I build something

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:28,310
besides react so for example if my

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,570
plug-in would be written with view would

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,140
that be an option where I have to start

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:36,650
changing my packaging and my NPM scripts

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,120
of course I mean you are not tied to any

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,060
of the choices we make in the starter

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,470
kit so if you use like angular and any

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,870
other technology you are of course very

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,270
welcome to do this just the starter kit

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,360
as an example react component but I mean

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:52,040
it's like ten lines of code so and even

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,660
incorporate itself we have like you see

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,300
the history of JavaScript developed in

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,990
the area jquery of angular react and

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,060
whatnot so you can change the frameworks

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,770
you work on you can also change the test

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,400
frameworks you work on like if you don't

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,280
want to use our test api for controlling

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,830
the browser and the different one so you

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,580
are happy to help this you're welcome to

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,600
do this and in fact we also have even

00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,940
tested this but a couple of other

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,130
frameworks of course we know our stuff

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,160
the best so if you have questions about

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:34,940
that we are best able to help you but

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:37,120
yeah is cockpit a linux session in your

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,120
web browser

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:44,140
not only in mind also in yours didn't I

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,140
