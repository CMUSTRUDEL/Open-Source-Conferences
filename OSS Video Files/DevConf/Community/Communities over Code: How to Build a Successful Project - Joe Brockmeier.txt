Title: Communities over Code: How to Build a Successful Project - Joe Brockmeier
Publication date: 2016-02-12
Playlist: Community
Description: 
	Building a successful open source project is about more than code - and some of the best practices are either non-obvious, hard to get right, or often ignored by folks who focus 100% on code.

In this session, we'll talk about things you can do to build community and attract more users - which in turn, will attract more developers, and make life easier (long-term) and help ensure a long life for your project.

We'll cover everything from governance to social media, marketing, and documentation.

okay guys welcome to the saturday

00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:01,960
session here at Def Con the next talk

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:05,830
well the first one of this day is going

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,560
to be about a how to build an open

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:11,620
successful open source project presented

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,770
by Joe brockmeyer who is a manager at

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,560
red head but but has been engaged in in

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,379
many open-source projects and basically

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:29,830
is an open source enthusiast so please

00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:34,090
welcome Joe okay thank you for the

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,810
introduction so I'm just going to jump

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,000
right to the slide that has all my

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,560
pertinent information here I'm going to

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,069
give all this information not because I

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,659
like to fluff up the talk or talk a lot

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,599
about myself but because this is

00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:52,560
relevant in terms of the talk itself so

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,819
I've been a red hat since august 2013

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,219
I've been in a pat i am an apache

00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:59,110
software foundation member joined the

00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:02,110
apache software foundation working on

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,380
the Apache CloudStack project when I was

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,389
working for citrix i'm also a PMC member

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,770
in the incubator which how many people

00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,900
are familiar with the Apache Incubator

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,759
that's kind of where this title comes

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,930
from a little bit okay so how many

00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,770
people are familiar with the apache

00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,629
software foundation okay good we have

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,490
what is called an incubator for new

00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,440
projects basically you don't just walk

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,180
into Apache and say hi I have a lump of

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,819
code and now I would like a project make

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,889
it a TLP and give me resources you come

00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:33,789
to the apache software foundation and

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:35,500
say hi we have a small but hopefully

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,819
growing community or we have something

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,610
that we would like to turn into an

00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,889
Apache community will you please accept

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,240
us and they say okay we'll put you in

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:44,919
the incubator to make sure that you're

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,039
doing things the apache way because

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,899
apache is a 501 C 3 that has rules that

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,210
govern how it releases code and things

00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,350
like that and companies like red hat and

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,660
I

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,730
em actually trust Apache to release code

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,610
that they can count on having already

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,050
been vetted somewhat and have legal

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,260
dependencies and all these other things

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,850
so there is an incubation process for

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,280
every project that they have to go

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,080
through that make sure that one company

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,960
isn't dominating the project or make

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,150
sure that you're not releasing stuff

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,170
that you know everybody expects if it

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,030
comes out of the apache software

00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,850
foundation it's apache software

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,870
foundation licensing right so you got to

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,520
make sure that they're not doing

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,110
something really fun like depending on

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:32,010
LG pv lgpl libraries unexpectedly and

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,870
things like that I was the first

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,620
opensuse community manager I did that

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,599
for two years that was an experience i'm

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,240
also a recovering tech journalist i did

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,280
that for many many years basically most

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,150
publications that cover open source i

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,620
have written for at some point and

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,880
completely unrelated to the talk these

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,470
are many of the things that I really

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,150
enjoy alright so what we're going to

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,190
cover in this talk I talked a little

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,220
fast and I apologize for that although i

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,750
think at least my perception when i'm

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,030
sitting listening to other people talk

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:10,170
is that it's harder to get bored when

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,580
the speaker talks quickly so people can

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,500
actually listen it a much faster rate

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,910
than most people speak that is not a

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,820
problem that most people have when i'm

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,470
talking about things on stage so anyway

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,690
i'm going to talk about why this is

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,580
important i want to talk about defining

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,930
success for a project because i have

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,760
people come up to me all the time it's

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,910
like you know we want to make our

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,890
project successful great what do you

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,180
mean by that okay so we'll talk about

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,340
that we'll talk a little bit about

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,100
governance and community by the way this

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,470
talk is compressing a lot of things that

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,150
don't always go together but as you

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,820
might guess a lot of these things have

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,830
to do with my day job working in OCS and

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,800
we bring all of these things together

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,570
you will also notice that the one thing

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,100
I'm not going to cover in this talk is

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,100
trying to tell any of you how to run

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,750
your projects technically okay I'm not

00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,580
going to have an opinion over Jenkins

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,589
over travis CI i'm not going to have an

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,689
opinion / code indentation i don't have

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:06,569
an opinion

00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:09,449
golang vs. pearl vs. whatever these are

00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:11,899
things that you can decide I am NOT an

00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:13,410
expert in any of those things

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,180
infrastructure we're going to talk a

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,610
little bit about project infrastructure

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,860
and what you actually need to have for a

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,600
successful project I'm going to talk a

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,240
little bit about marketing and promotion

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,069
I am not using the textbook term of

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,350
marketing here we're really when we talk

00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:30,209
about marketing for projects I'm lumping

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,850
in a lot of things from public relations

00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:36,180
and marketing and promotions and

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,709
communications and things but they all

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,870
kind of blend together when you don't

00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:41,220
have a distinct marketing and PR budget

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,389
analyst budget and all of those things

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,490
okay and finally I just want to put in a

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,339
solicitation for how how can we help

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,740
your projects with a and I will

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,230
reiterate this later we do not have

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,999
infinite resources or people but o SAS

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,269
would like to help projects as much as

00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:02,339
we can that may vary between if there is

00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:05,089
a business case to help a project by the

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,589
way how many are red hatters here okay

00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,839
so if there's a business case to help

00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,100
grow your project we can make that and

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,429
I've been through that process that

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,199
process takes a long time another

00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:18,059
important thing is anything that you

00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:20,759
take is that you think is going to take

00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,879
two weeks can take up to a year when

00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:26,069
you're talking about budgets so but

00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,819
anything we can do we will certainly try

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:31,379
to do want to put in a quick plug this

00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,899
is part of the marketing part that comes

00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,839
at the end but remember use social media

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,699
okay so I want to put in a plug for the

00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,170
conference please tweet about this talk

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,269
please tweet about the other talks that

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,939
you're going to these are the relevant

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,649
details right here I'm jzb on twitter by

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:49,589
the way that's a really easy way to find

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:52,920
me later dev cops easy is a conference

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:56,009
and hashtag def comps easy please make a

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,749
point to blog right do whatever to

00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,459
promote the conference and have I said

00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:01,079
that the conference organizers have done

00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:03,800
a great job because if I haven't I want

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,800
to say that right now

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:12,690
so all right so what is community / code

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,310
basically you can do a couple of things

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,930
in open source and companies run

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,910
projects in a couple of different ways

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,850
one way to run an open source project is

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,500
to develop something toss it over the

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,030
wall with an open source license and

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,030
keep going and do traditional

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,460
development as if open source processes

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,040
don't actually exist okay so you could

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,170
basically spend all of your time doing

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,810
things as our tradition the traditional

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,160
way not taking input from other people

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,220
not really trying to build a community

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,020
and you can go a fair a long way with

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,140
that sort of thing anybody remember my

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,300
sequel they did that for a long time and

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,920
they basically for a long time we're

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,690
very popular how many people think my

00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,070
sequel is on an upward trajectory at

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:02,650
this point right not because the quality

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,990
of the code is necessarily worse than it

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,880
was five six seven years ago but because

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,530
the quality of the community has gone

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,310
downhill and people have moved on to

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:15,100
other things okay how you do things is

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:18,700
as important sometimes as what you do

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:22,570
okay this goes against for example the

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,100
the example of the fantastic contributor

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,380
who's kind of a pain in the butt to work

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,560
with okay but he's such a good

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,270
contributor yeah but five other people

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,830
left your project because they didn't

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,820
want to deal with that first thing in

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,470
the morning when they look in their

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,750
email okay so what you have in your

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,760
project you have to always be building

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,520
and trying to make your community better

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,980
you cannot afford I'm going to use a bad

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,660
word but I'm quoting somebody as des

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,880
Donny Burke holes would say you cannot

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,880
afford ass holes in your project okay

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,250
when you have somebody and we all have

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,980
bad days okay that doesn't mean like the

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,840
first time somebody sends a grumpy email

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,490
that they should be booted but when

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,830
there are consistent bad actors are

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,110
people who are consistently hard to work

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,620
with you may want to find ways to either

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,230
coach them or remove them

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,060
your community okay by the way coaching

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,710
is important to don't just don't just go

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,810
straight to like okay well your time's

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,540
up thank you for coming sometimes people

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,279
just don't know okay and you could do a

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,960
whole talk about that which I will not

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:29,750
do but something to think about remember

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,610
that everyone leaves eventually one way

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,690
the other sometimes its feet first but

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,400
hopefully it's because they found

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,430
another day job or something else and

00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,430
you cannot depend on a community

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,130
basically always being around one person

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,500
or a set of contributors okay you need

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,800
to build a community that is going to be

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,870
sustained at Red Hat we think about okay

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,089
if you're at this level of the company

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,880
and you want to move up you need to be

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,260
thinking about grooming other people to

00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,839
take your job so you don't leave a

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,270
vacuum right same thing in the community

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,180
if you are a hardcore contributor to

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,310
something unless you're going to make a

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,500
lifetime commitment and and plan on that

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,790
project not to outlive you you need to

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,970
be thinking about who's going to replace

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,529
you when you move on okay the other

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,089
thing that I see a lot with companies

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:21,170
and I'm not I'm not pointing a finger at

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:24,800
anybody citrix is you know basically

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,920
we'll do it right later most important

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,300
we have to ship now okay that will get

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
you through this quarter that will get

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,420
you through the next quarter it might

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,839
get you through a year or two it will

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,240
doom your project okay now you may be

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,330
able to coast on a good project a

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,350
technically good project for a while but

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,209
unless you're building a community

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,740
around it it's not sustainable okay so

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:50,890
sometimes you need to make a choice to

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,810
think about the long-term future and

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,370
maybe mrs. ship date sometimes or maybe

00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,250
figure out how you're going to work

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,620
around bringing in other actors from

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:06,529
other companies okay pardon me while I

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:09,650
take a so some of the core principles

00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:12,560
that you need to have in any successful

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,240
community communication and openness in

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,620
Apache we like to say if it didn't

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,120
happen on the mailing list it didn't

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,250
happen what this means is in a project

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,510
you can't take decisions in groups of

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,700
two or three people and then

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,160
bring them back as and not allow other

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,700
people to have input when they are

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,470
should be part of that process okay so

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,000
when we go to Apache con we don't get a

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,530
bunch of people sitting together in a

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,010
room and making decisions for a project

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,660
you can talk about things you can come

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,400
up with plans and you can carry that

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,230
back to the mailing list and say hey

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,820
what do you all think of this we were

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,770
sitting in person we were at the pub

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,050
last night whatever and we have some

00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:55,700
great ideas would you have to give other

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:58,370
people ways to weigh in okay mentorship

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,200
you have to spend some time working on

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,850
talent in your community you have to

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,890
spend time bringing people up to speed

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,630
you have to spend some time working with

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,940
people who have been there awhile who

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,670
may have plateaued maybe they're a great

00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,040
programmer but their personal skills of

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,199
plateaued or whatever or their

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,520
organizational skills of plateaued you

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,500
need to always be spending time

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,959
mentoring other people you also need to

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,270
be willing to be mentored and asked for

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,890
help this was a hard thing for me when I

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,320
when I started working with Apache

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,940
because for many many years I was a

00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,920
writer and I was used to tinkering with

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,020
technology and figuring it out alone and

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,840
having you know just a deadline to worry

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:39,410
about but I did a couple of cycles as a

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,110
point release manager and I quickly

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,300
learned my limitations with get and I

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,590
and with doing merges and things like

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,070
that and I could have waited and

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,540
struggled with it or I could just go to

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,400
people who knew better than I and asked

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,470
for help and that's what I did but it

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,630
wasn't the first time it was the first

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,620
time somebody poked me like hey you know

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,070
that thing you said you're going to have

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,050
done yesterday what's going on so you've

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:07,940
got to be got to be willing to do both

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:09,860
earned rights this is very important how

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,080
many people participate in any way in

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,690
atomic or docker efforts container

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,000
efforts or we're just a couple people

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,740
okay how many people work with up

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,330
streams that are relevant to a red hat

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:26,270
product okay anybody ever run into

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,280
problems where red hat needs to ship

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,140
something or we need a feature or we

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,130
need a patch or something like that and

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,290
upstream doesn't want it okay that's not

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:40,140
fun is it no now imagine

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,210
turn the tables imagine we're running an

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,590
upstream project and someone comes to us

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:49,710
and they have the same problem okay we

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,240
have to find ways to give other people a

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,980
seat at the table when we're running a

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,720
project and we want to seat at the table

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,080
when we're participating in the project

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,710
there needs to be a clear path to having

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,390
rights in a project quality is often

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,800
better than speed i think this one

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,660
pretty much speaks for itself right

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,740
another core principle all contributions

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,810
matter if you look at Debian if you look

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,820
at fedora if you look at many of the

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,910
projects that are more than ten years

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,970
old you will notice that their language

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,700
is burdened with like when it comes to

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,650
participation or membership and things

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,070
like that they all center around

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,750
packaging and technical contributions

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:36,060
they do not center around things like

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,070
people who do graphics or people who do

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,020
social media work or blogging or

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,440
documentation or any of the other things

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,860
that make projects go so you need to

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,900
make sure that your community also

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,570
respects and thanks people for

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,060
contributions that are not code okay

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,740
there are a lot of contributions that we

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,520
need from people that are not just code

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,540
and finally users matter how many people

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,090
went to Tim Burke's keynote yesterday

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,100
most of you I hope not as many as I

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,450
thought okay well one of the things that

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,070
he said when he was talking about how to

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,720
be you know an effective developer I

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,500
don't like the term rock star but an

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,630
effective developer is that if you're

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,740
just doing something for yourself it's

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,750
basically an academic exercise and this

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,530
is a problem i had with KDE when they

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,200
did the infamous 3.5 to 4.0 switch was

00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,090
they got a bunch of feedback saying no

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,450
this is not good enough this is not

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:35,250
whatever this is not what we want and

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,690
they were like well we're the ones doing

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,360
the work we don't care what your opinion

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,210
is that was literally what they said

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,860
back to people if you're not doing it

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,600
for the users why are you doing it I

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,340
mean if you why put it on github if

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,260
you're not doing it for anybody else

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,730
right why ship it if it's not for other

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,950
people

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,280
so you have to think about your users

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:57,380
wants and needs and sometimes you have

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,420
to hold back the desire to say patches

00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,980
welcome and instead work on other

00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:05,510
people's problems so defining success is

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,060
another very important part of this by

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,740
the way I'm happy to take questions I

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,480
think i only have 40 minutes so there's

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,250
a lot to cover but i am happy to take

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,050
questions during the during the talk so

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,640
feel free i know you're all very shy so

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:23,630
feel free to raise a hand if you have

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:26,240
something to say ok define your project

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,890
goals you need to know what you're

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,410
building why you're building it in for

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,150
whom again I get called into

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:36,410
conversations where people are like we

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:40,700
want a community okay a community of

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:42,770
whom to do what you know just having

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,290
kind of this nebulous idea that more

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,730
people is better doesn't quite work you

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,860
need to know your target audience you

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,680
need to know what you want to get out of

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,420
that now Red Hat often when you know the

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,350
first goal is we need to continue

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,690
growing and making money but when we

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,330
talk about an audience and who we're

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,330
trying to reach that varies you know who

00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:09,020
we're trying to actually pull in and

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,770
projects differ so for example the

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:15,230
audience for fedora is much larger and

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:19,010
less well defined than say the audience

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:21,530
for overt ok we have a much better

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,390
defined audience for a project like over

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:27,440
or Rdio than we do for something like

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:29,720
fedora and I'm sure most of you have

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,830
watched the last few years as Fedora has

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,060
worked on you know okay we ship this big

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,980
distribution that's general purpose and

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,620
you figure out what to do with it too

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,450
okay the message we're getting is we

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,160
need to do a better job of delivering a

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,970
tailored experience for certain use

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,770
cases okay also has to be measurable

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,600
okay you can do a lot of stuff if you

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,470
can't measure success and trace it back

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,330
to what you've done it's useless okay

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,040
you need to communicate the goals to

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,680
everyone in the project on a regular

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,010
basis ok this is this is one thing it's

00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,930
very easy for people to get

00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,420
tunnel vision on the one thing that they

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,000
work on and lose track of what they

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,760
should be really focused on big picture

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,650
okay so you need to occasionally remind

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,520
people of the mission of the project or

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:21,010
what you are trying to achieve it is

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:27,100
possible to be successful accidentally

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:29,740
docker but it is it's hard to sustain

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,870
okay it's really the linux kernel is a

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,730
perfect the legs colonel breaks many

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,000
many many of these rules and they have

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:39,250
been just tremendously lucky at the

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,080
right place at the right time they did

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,440
some things right they did some things

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,720
horribly wrong but you know they are

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,130
while they are a poster child for open

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,350
source they are also a terrible example

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:56,740
okay you can just stumble into success

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,420
but I wouldn't count on it all right I

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,580
want to talk briefly about governance

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,180
and community and I've already touched

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,910
on this a little bit but one size cannot

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,370
fit all okay so i'm going to pick on

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,680
somebody in the audience Ian runs a

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:15,430
project called image factory okay and

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:19,420
that project has a has a narrow focus

00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:22,060
it's you know its user base is about you

00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:26,560
know this big if the dora is this big

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:29,860
right and so a governance policy or

00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,180
governance set up for his project is not

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,980
the same thing that's going to work for

00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:37,000
fedora it's not the same thing that

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,250
works for dr. or anybody else ok so the

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,720
scope of your project and the mission of

00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,420
your project is going to affect your

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,600
governance but some clear guide things

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,760
guidelines on how things are done is

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:52,300
very important people come into a

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,400
project and i'm always because like with

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,920
project atomic i was heads down in that

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,470
project and had a pretty good idea of

00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,850
what we wanted to do and then a new

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,410
person would come in and say i want to

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,170
help but i have no idea where to start

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,940
i'm like it's obvious right okay it's

00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,100
obvious to me it's not obvious to them

00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,330
okay it's not obvious who to go to when

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,820
you want to change something it's not

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:16,889
obvious where to change something so you

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:19,120
have to have a map for people okay

00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:21,100
you also want to know how does the user

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,749
get rights to become a contributor okay

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,029
how many people have sent patches to a

00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:26,950
project for a long time and gotten

00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:28,450
frustrated because it's like look I've

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,070
been working with you for three years

00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,620
I've been sending patches you accept

00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,899
them but I can't just commit directly to

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,720
the repository that's frustrating right

00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:39,580
okay you don't want to do that I've had

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,679
that experience with like documentation

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,450
it's like you know after fifty sixty

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,519
patches if you still don't trust me to

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,620
do it right and you're not telling me

00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,419
how I'm doing it wrong I'm starting to

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,139
lose faith that you know I'm ever going

00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:55,240
to be on equal footing okay likewise if

00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:57,399
you are accepted as a contributor how do

00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,619
you become part of the inner circle that

00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:01,960
makes decisions about the project how do

00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:04,809
you earn rights you really need to have

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,450
those things be clear sometimes they

00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:08,889
don't need to be enumerated as long as

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,809
you're doing them well and you have a

00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:12,340
culture of that but this is one of the

00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:14,409
things that we work on in the apache

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,619
software foundation and the incubator is

00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:19,480
trying to teach projects that you know

00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,249
you started this project with 12 people

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,559
from your company you've been in here

00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:24,730
for a year we have 15 other companies

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,710
contributing and yet somehow

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,919
mysteriously not a single one of them

00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:34,240
has contribution rights that's a problem

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:36,700
okay we can't Red Hat cannot build

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,080
successful communities if other people

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,509
never feel like they're going to be

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,279
equal other companies are not going to

00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:43,929
put money into participating in our

00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:48,039
projects if they don't feel like they'll

00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:51,100
ever ever be close to equal okay Golden

00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:53,049
Rule treat contributors like you want to

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,879
be treated in another project look

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:58,360
around your projects and ask yourself

00:26:54,879 --> 00:27:02,679
what I personally contribute to this if

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,409
you know it was run by someone else okay

00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,049
how many people for example object to

00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:10,149
canonical clas and won't contribute to

00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:13,720
things because of the clas the canonical

00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:15,309
has okay we shouldn't have those things

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,649
and we try not to have those things

00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:20,619
because we want people to contribute

00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:24,309
okay we don't want to have better rights

00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:26,649
than others for example and finally this

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,970
isn't precisely governance but I've

00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:31,850
already talked about the importance of

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:34,610
you know recognizing contributions from

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,140
others i also want to just briefly touch

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,940
on you need to pay attention to

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,789
diversity in your project both for

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,620
people and skills okay you need to make

00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:45,440
sure that you're not just cultivating

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:50,570
other people like you you need to try to

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,010
broaden your community a couple of

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,650
suggestions again I've already touched

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,690
on a couple of these things everything

00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,419
should happen on a the equivalent to a

00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:02,000
mailing list okay if you have I RC

00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,890
meetings at a certain time guaranteed

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,630
it's two o'clock in the morning for

00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,390
somebody who might be contributing to

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,549
your community right if you live in

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,169
europe and everybody else participates

00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:14,630
in the project is on the west coast of

00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:16,490
the United States you are going to have

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,500
a truck trouble participating in

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,070
real-time meetings if you're in

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,809
Australia and you know whatever it just

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:27,890
holds true across the world and we have

00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:30,350
a lot of things like that I'm not going

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:33,140
to advocate sometimes projects try to

00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,940
balance this by saying okay once a month

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:39,140
everybody in North America is getting up

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,730
at 2am to have this thing no people

00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,429
don't do their best work at two in the

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:47,539
morning maybe find an asynchronous way

00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:51,020
to communicate instead okay I offer

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:52,850
these these are often also you know my

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,059
experience and apache that I think works

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:58,120
very well try to give people about 72

00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:01,760
hours on a mailing list for feedback

00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,730
that's about 72 business hours not like

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,919
don't send something out at 8am friday

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,919
and then monday morning call it good you

00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:13,240
know give people some reasonable time to

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,309
communicate but also hold to that window

00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,159
okay set the expectation that if you if

00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:21,140
you open a discussion on a mailing list

00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,270
and by the way if you're going to open a

00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,510
discussion on a mailing list make it

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:29,179
obvious use a good subject line and hey

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:31,220
maybe even put discuss in front so

00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:35,570
people can identify those things versus

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,700
random missives to the universe but

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,230
basically give people time to comment

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,570
and then hold them to it don't let

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,790
people come into a community and say

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,620
I just wasn't paying attention to email

00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,300
for three weeks I'm sorry but I want to

00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,880
go back and reverse this decision that

00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,440
we made you know you have to have a

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,830
community where you can make decisions

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,110
effectively and move on I like lazy

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:01,280
consensus for decision making is anybody

00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:03,050
familiar with lazy consensus hands not

00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,950
many many all right lazy consensus is

00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:10,160
basically with certain exceptions you

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,170
send something to a list and when people

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,970
don't reply you're just assuming that's

00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,820
assenting to whatever it is that you

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,220
want to do okay now obviously there are

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,710
things that you can't do that for you

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:25,640
can't lazy consensus a license change

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:28,700
from ASL to gplv3 you need you know

00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,280
direct descent for that but generally

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,590
speaking lazy consensus and an Apache

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,720
for example you can't add a PMC member

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,300
based on lazy consensus or do a release

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,930
on lazy consensus you actually have to

00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:44,030
get strong plus ones from people but as

00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:47,090
far as like well I would like to change

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:50,060
this library to this library in this

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,500
tiny little part of the project you want

00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,570
to send that to a mailing list and give

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,190
people a chance to look at it but you

00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,610
don't want to hold the decision so long

00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,950
that it holds everything up leave your

00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,900
hat at the door pun intended when you

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,910
are participating in a project you

00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,620
should never be taking the position that

00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,590
my opinion matters more than yours

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,300
because i work for red hat you should

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:14,030
never take the position that you're you

00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,010
know if somebody from pick whatever

00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,840
company in your heads is the direct

00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:20,780
competitor to red hat or the most evil

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,830
company on the planet comes into your

00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,360
community and wants to make a

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,130
contribution they should not be

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,630
dismissed because of that as long as

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:31,400
they are participating in good faith

00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:33,200
they should be treated equally okay I

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,690
already said the part about make

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,350
decisions stick and finally document the

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,840
hell out of everything please okay find

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,430
a way to when you make decisions put

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,710
them somewhere they can be found and

00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,240
revisited so that you know this is a

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,270
thing I see over and over again in

00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,490
projects and frankly just general human

00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,370
interactions when it involves groups

00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:58,150
that have rotating people in and out

00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,770
is decision is made time passes six

00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,150
months later people forget about the

00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,710
decision and want to revisit it or

00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,480
people didn't like that decision and use

00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,120
an opportunity of time passing to bring

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,670
it up again and sometimes that's valid

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,740
sometimes things change but usually it's

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,540
just a disruption so if you make a

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,210
decision that you're going to do X Y or

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,460
Z you need to document it and refer

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,100
people back to that decision okay and

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,620
not just keep reliving conversations

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,410
over and over again any questions on

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:31,540
that is any of this helping or making

00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:33,190
sense okay all right infrastructure what

00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,920
I like to call the care and feeding for

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:38,020
community okay these are pretty obvious

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,660
but these are things that in OSS we set

00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,850
up over and over again mailing lists for

00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,230
projects you should have a user list you

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,050
should have a developed you should have

00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:49,059
a private list more than likely you

00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,309
should have a security alias that goes

00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:54,190
to somebody who is going to be

00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:56,830
responsible for security things for the

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,750
love of all that's holy please do not

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,640
have a security alias if no one pays

00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,790
attention to it just send it directly to

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,429
red hat security okay the worst thing in

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:09,790
the world is when someone actually sends

00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:12,580
you like you have a zero day and nobody

00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:14,350
notices okay so have somebody who is

00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:19,750
responsible for paying attention to

00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:22,660
those things depending on the project it

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,760
may or may not merit having a forum it

00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,559
depends on the audience that you have

00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,410
and whether they like to interact on

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,900
forums and this is a really important

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,580
part whether you have someone to man the

00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,460
forum or woman the forum sorry I don't

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:39,580
want to be but people the forum and

00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,350
watch for things coming in okay because

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,540
if you have a forum where people are

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,660
asking questions or spamming it and no

00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,400
one is watching that's bad this is a

00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,510
this is a thing that we've had lately

00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,130
with project atomic which in you know I

00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,780
was running project atomic as the

00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,370
community lead and then I got promoted

00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,260
and had other people and all this other

00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,730
stuff and then suddenly like I don't

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,860
have time to go look at the forum every

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:07,070
day but we didn't back fill the position

00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:12,109
for six months so it's tumbleweeds and

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:14,750
and spam lots of spam and so please pay

00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:18,440
attention to that bug tracker pretty

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:21,710
obvious right you need one documentation

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,839
and maybe a wiki wiki czar where

00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:29,030
information goes to die but people still

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,619
like them forget what I said a few

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,119
months ago it got retweeted a bunch with

00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:34,099
something like there's there's no better

00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:54,020
way to see the broken hopes and dreams

00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:55,609
than a wiki you know yes that's that's a

00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,890
that's a legitimate question I mean it

00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:00,020
they can be useful but also I mean if

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,180
you go through i'll pick on fedora if

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:07,089
you go through the fedora wiki it's not

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,089
maintained well and who has the time

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:14,660
sorry sure sure sure but but large areas

00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:20,079
are not i will assume that the QE

00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:22,910
portion is lovingly maintained all right

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,650
code repositories clearly you have to

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:29,599
thank you clearly you have to have those

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:31,880
probably just pass around the tarball

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,710
sure whatever works no more than likely

00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,290
your code repository these days is going

00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,130
to be get maybe on github maybe some

00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:41,770
other pager one of those other services

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:45,020
how many folks know about fedora pager

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:46,940
fisher okay fedora actually provides a

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,550
service for people who want to host code

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:53,240
and do not want to be on a proprietary

00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:56,150
service it is not as fancy or you know

00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,250
whatever is github but it's maintained

00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,750
an open source and you don't have to

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:06,250
worry about it turning evil one day when

00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:08,990
oracle buys get up so anybody remember

00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:13,270
the whole kernel thing and why we have

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:13,270
get what's up bitkeeper thank you yeah

00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:21,779
right right it amazes me how people do

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,549
not learn from history I mean it's you

00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,109
know bitkeeper is why we have get and

00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:27,210
now everybody has moved to github which

00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:33,660
is kind of like bitkeeper but you know

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:40,440
all right you may want to provide it I'm

00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:43,049
sorry sure and and in 10 years will say

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,230
without github we won't have whatever it

00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:49,650
whatever comes after it right but but it

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,059
movin on movin on Trello and Kanban you

00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,740
may want to provide these things for

00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,980
people to track things that are not bugs

00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,140
features and ideas and so forth there

00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,329
there's can board there's a couple of

00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,519
other free software versions of this

00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:03,900
that people really like continuous

00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,279
integration this is something that a

00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,109
couple of years ago wasn't really a

00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:08,819
thing but projects are asking for more

00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:10,950
and more is a way to do testing and

00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:12,690
continuous integration these are good

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,309
things you should find a way to do them

00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,440
you should do them early in your project

00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:19,769
before things move to a point where it

00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,329
becomes ugly without getting too deeply

00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,009
into suggesting what you do technically

00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:25,920
I would even suggest i think we had to

00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:27,930
talk about this yesterday about you know

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,690
somebody said no commit without

00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:35,400
documentation i would also suggest no

00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:37,200
commits without tests so and finally in

00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,789
most and very importantly translation

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,970
tools because not everybody speaks

00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,319
English and maybe people in other parts

00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:49,109
of the world would like to have things

00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:50,700
in their language so very briefly this

00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:51,989
thing we're doing here where I can see

00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,690
you and you can see me and we can

00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:56,369
exchange words and beers it's a good

00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,749
thing it's a good way to build community

00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:00,809
and you should find ways to do it in

00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:02,309
your community if you possibly can we

00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:05,190
still do not have a way to deliver beer

00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:09,480
over tcp/ip this is a tragedy but it's

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:12,059
the truth so meet ups lugs daycares

00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,039
probably not daycares but find a way to

00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:16,920
you know meet people in your community

00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:19,170
and talk about your projects and you

00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,519
know most of you probably live in a city

00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,829
where other people care about your

00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,869
technology so get out and meet them and

00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:25,220
talk to them and you will

00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:28,579
learn things and they will learn things

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,140
from you more than likely i come to a

00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:31,670
lot of these things and I do talks and I

00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,839
guarantee you that I will learn more at

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,400
this conference and you will learn

00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:36,710
sitting through my talk and I don't just

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,970
mean attending other talks I just mean

00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,349
talking to other people and hearing

00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:44,960
their ideas and learning what they're

00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:46,339
doing okay that said you cannot depend

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,529
on having a budget to do in person

00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:52,519
collaboration all of the time so make it

00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:54,680
count and and try to make it happen try

00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:57,319
to find time when you are in a group for

00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,150
learning socializing and doing try to do

00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:00,680
all of those things when you are at a

00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,990
conference try to spend some time

00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,599
working try to spend some time going to

00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:08,180
talks and learning from other people and

00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,160
try to spend some time going out and

00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,079
actually socializing with people because

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,049
that part is important to bonding with

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,910
people look I love open source i got

00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:19,759
into open source and I got enthused

00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,680
about open source when I was working for

00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:23,180
lenox mall in 1999 in the first

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,829
conference I went to there were two

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,230
vendors that we worked with its old

00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:29,480
backup products and I was used to the

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,190
proprietary world where company a and

00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,489
Company B can't like each other because

00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:35,960
they're competing or are right no after

00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:38,119
the show was over they all went to

00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,789
dinner and had beers together and I'm

00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,910
like wait I can work in an industry and

00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:45,829
I can go have beers with people that

00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:47,660
work for a competitor I can do work with

00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:50,480
competitors I can have friends all over

00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,759
the industry how much would it suck if

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,380
every time somebody left red hat you

00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:56,029
could no longer be friends with them or

00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,829
talk to them or work with them that

00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:59,480
would be horrible we're all here really

00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:03,019
because we love working with this

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,779
community right so remember that when

00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:07,700
we're working on these things and

00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:10,069
finally when you do in-person events try

00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,289
to carry as much back to the community

00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:15,410
as possible for two reasons one a lot of

00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:17,420
people who are here for every person

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,579
who's here there are 10 people who are

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,809
not who care about what's going on here

00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:25,849
or more so you have a responsibility for

00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:27,829
carrying some of this information back

00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:29,779
to those folks take the highlights back

00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:31,249
don't make them feel jealous I'm not

00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:33,530
talking about the pictures on facebook

00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:37,430
of life world's largest beer

00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:39,350
yeah no I'm talking about you know bring

00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,970
back information that will help them and

00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,410
because they couldn't attend and

00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,900
hopefully they will do the same for you

00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:47,350
right up blogs about one or two talks

00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:51,110
that you went to that are useful okay

00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:52,910
share information I am I'm pushing this

00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:55,370
is a slow process because people are

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,740
resistant but I'm pushing for with us

00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:00,500
ass anytime we fund travel for anybody

00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,930
you must blog about it you must provide

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:08,780
pictures you must carry back information

00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:10,850
okay but also it helps you remember what

00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,710
you learned here okay if you take the

00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,510
responsibility to sit down and write an

00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,940
event report or sit down and actually

00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:19,940
blog about talks it will help you retain

00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:22,940
that information okay marketing and

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,350
promotion last bits first of all you

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,970
need to know your audience and your

00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:29,450
goals we've already covered that right

00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:31,820
but if you don't have sharp goals you

00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:34,670
are unfocused in what you want to do

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,010
marketing-wise think about who you want

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:40,550
to reach think about the personas okay

00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:42,440
we did an exercise was it last year the

00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,780
year before we sat down we were starting

00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,930
to talk about the developer tools for

00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,400
containers and we started talking about

00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:52,060
well who are the people who are going to

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,180
use these things that's deeply important

00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:58,310
okay what do the people want that are

00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,200
using your stuff craft a story to them

00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,030
okay you need to see and then go back

00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,830
and see how what you're doing Fitz that

00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:08,540
story okay do a feedback loop you should

00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,670
be doing user surveys you should be

00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,760
talking to your users and asking them

00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:16,280
okay how does you know how are we doing

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,380
is this is this working for you are you

00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,620
enjoying this does can we do better

00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,660
where can we do better sometimes that

00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,940
will also entice people to join in and

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,400
help because we're do contributors come

00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,470
from they come from users it's it's like

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,810
a beautiful cocoon after using something

00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:34,730
for a while they enter the little thing

00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:38,930
and then they come out as a butterfly

00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:41,180
that contributes okay maybe not but

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:42,620
seriously I mean most of the people who

00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,330
are contributing to open source these

00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,620
days started as users right you don't

00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,940
just leap into contributing

00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,070
project voice and messaging you need to

00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,440
tailor your website to your users and

00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:55,180
target audience in other words if you

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,430
are trying to target people who care

00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,860
about docker your website website should

00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:03,430
not look like it came from 1999 with a

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,410
bad hangover okay you need to have

00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:07,060
talking points and messaging for

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,520
everybody that they can talk about your

00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,200
project you need to explain benefits

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,900
this is something that hangs a lot of

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,870
people up even like the Fedora

00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,820
workstation folks i usually get when i

00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:20,590
was working on fedora marketing and

00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,200
trying to pull together the release /

00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:25,480
for several years you would get back

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,700
this implemented blah library and

00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,840
implemented this and and waylon now does

00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,030
foo and it's like oh yeah what does that

00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,190
do for me it's like I don't understand

00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,350
why do I care as a user I don't care

00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,870
that Waylon does foo I care that it met

00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:43,000
lets me do you know copy and paste

00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:44,710
between windows more efficiently I carry

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,010
I care about this that or the other I

00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:50,110
don't care about the technology I used

00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:56,260
to get horrible press releases from Java

00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:58,180
companies implements jsr 342 okay that's

00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,670
nice I don't know what that is but good

00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:05,410
for you tell me how that benefits me

00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:07,300
okay and finally find a way to show me

00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,830
how to be successful quickly if you

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,980
don't have a start guide that helps

00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:13,750
someone up and running in whatever is a

00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,370
reasonable time frame five minutes is

00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:19,120
not reasonable for CloudStack five

00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:21,550
minutes is reasonable for atomic make

00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,160
sure that you have that blogging and

00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:26,440
social media okay take the time to write

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,990
about what you're doing provide social

00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,320
media guidelines and advanced have an

00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:35,410
editorial calendar SEO scheduled target

00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,210
influencers for bonus points if you have

00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:39,010
somebody who works in social media and

00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,330
goes and follows people who are relevant

00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,060
to the industry that you're targeting

00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,500
and interacts with them and talks to

00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,170
them and get some talking about your

00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,480
project you are on the road to better

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:54,420
success than just blasting your message

00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:56,800
out okay finally release announcements

00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,789
this is something that drives me bug

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,189
nuts because people

00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:02,719
want to notice engineering teams want to

00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:05,179
push a release out the door the minute

00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:07,189
it's done and they want to do this on a

00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:08,779
well we're not sure when it's going to

00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:10,789
be done it's done as soon as we fix this

00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:12,049
bug okay sure that out the door and they

00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:13,699
don't give people time to write a

00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:15,619
release announcement or schedule it or

00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:18,679
do the proper exploitation as they say

00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:21,589
in blues brothers you know you actually

00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:23,900
I if your code is done on friday it's

00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:26,150
going to sit there till next Tuesday do

00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,160
not release an announcement on a friday

00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:34,729
unless you just want no one to see it

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:36,859
okay i am out of time so summary this is

00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:39,739
a process it is not an in-state you will

00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:43,459
never be done successful communities

00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:45,410
change they grow they evolve okay single

00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:48,109
company projects are not as good as

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,849
diverse projects if you build it they

00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:52,339
will not come you still have to promote

00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:55,579
it if you're not growing you are dying

00:45:52,339 --> 00:46:09,619
and finally golden rule keep that in

00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:11,810
mind thank you very much that is not my

00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:28,940
