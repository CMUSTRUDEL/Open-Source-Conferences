hello everyone hello thank you for

00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,980
attending this session my topic today is

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,829
email marketing done the open-source way

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,699
I will talk about an email marketing

00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:24,480
software - which is for sending

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,939
newsletters and email campaigns let me

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,099
introduce myself first I am a community

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,609
advocate and community manager for page

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,699
please

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:36,210
I am a fedora ambassador which I suppose

00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:38,309
does not impress anyone here i wikimedia

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,949
volunteer and another labs hackerspace

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,840
member which is a local open-source

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:45,690
community back in my country where i met

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,370
all of this open-source communities that

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,640
I am involved with so pitch beliefs is

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,429
an 100% open-source software it is

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,719
licensed under the a GPL version 3

00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:03,960
license it is hosted on github was

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,930
initially launched 20 years back in 2000

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,890
in March 2000 and it is a community

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,630
driven project this is a simple

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,650
screenshot from the pitch for this

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:22,320
dashboard which is what the

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:25,710
administrators see as of context just a

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,450
small parenthesis I am going to

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,540
faithfully limited which is the company

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,000
that offers support for customers that

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,100
do not want to host the software

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,320
themselves then they just want to use it

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:44,310
so what is this session about about two

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,980
years ago we started thinking and

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,730
reconsidering the development cycle we

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,980
used to follow so we started researching

00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,190
and meeting to each other and second to

00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,130
each other and see what other

00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:02,160
development approach we could follow at

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,610
a time and you wind up to what we have

00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,610
here

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,990
another thing to have in mind was the

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,360
three different projects that were

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,700
running simultaneously was the pitch

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,130
ministry which is the software we have

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,980
now we're currently on version three

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,990
point five point zero pitch will is four

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,000
and the rest api which are working

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:28,110
progress which beliefs four is a

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,360
rewritten version of the the one that we

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,820
have now and the CMS which is the

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,050
software used for the hosted lines why

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,290
it was considered a different

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,210
development approach first of all our

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,940
releases at that time who were happening

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:49,440
were feature based and not time based

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:52,200
and that means that we would have any

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,610
release every time that all these list

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,460
of features that were preset was met and

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:05,850
implemented and not have a specific and

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:07,980
concise time frame of the releases well

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,590
it was that a problem which we realized

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,540
two years ago first of all we had a

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,820
consistent time frame of the releases

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,350
and nobody knew when we will have in

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,120
your release and we won't have a new

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,959
release every three months or maybe if

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,060
every seven months it would take very

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,100
much longer for the community actually

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,340
to benefit from the software itself

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,910
because it would take longer longer to

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,400
deliver the final product the community

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,930
couldn't get further develop involved

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,280
and another thing that was very

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,320
important to us was the testing phase

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,239
which would take longer at the time

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,000
because it was in terror internal and

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:53,880
there was no better version of the of

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,610
the software so meeting started cold

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,380
started going on because most of the

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,130
team was private in different cities and

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:06,959
countries and we started considering an

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:09,750
agile approach what was considered on

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,239
the way so a child was the first thought

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,260
but actually we had to put way much more

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,060
thought from behind because we could not

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,760
be as straight

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,780
as a giant would suggest so we had to

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,660
adopt somehow our activity and with the

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:32,130
community and their releases and the

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,700
features that we wanted to add so how

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,220
about I go

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,440
actually could we be did we have the

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,410
resources to do that how quickly could

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,380
wait up how that would affect the way

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,510
we're doing things these are some of the

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,130
challenges and thoughts that we've had

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:56,180
before we actually decide what to do and

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:59,340
which we tried to to resolve later some

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:02,580
some of the options that we had in mind

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:06,030
was it six months or a three month or a

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,590
one-month release cycle we soon realized

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,360
that the most agile approach would have

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:18,020
been the one month releases and that

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,020
would so actually the problem is earlier

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:24,419
how that would affect the way we are

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:29,460
doing currently things we were doing

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:31,320
things at that time what actually we

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,150
were able to meet our deadlines because

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,820
one month it's a very short amount of

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,770
time and I did we have the resources to

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:44,400
implement everything that we had in mind

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:46,169
at that time as of context the community

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,690
was not much involved on the testing

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:51,270
phase so an another thing that would

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:54,750
come up was there braiding process which

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,250
would conclude on a ton of error and we

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,320
didn't want to have people spend time

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,479
troubleshooting upgrader configuration

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,940
problems but we want them to focus on

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:09,479
actually testing and using and trying

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:13,050
the the software so that was then when

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,110
the automatic updater was introduced the

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:21,080
automatic updater is a process in order

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:24,539
to update the software what easily and

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,020
know the risk of errors it's an

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,830
automatic process and you didn't have to

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,640
do actually

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:38,670
technical skills in order to upgrade to

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:42,930
the latest version so we had to choose

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:44,940
our tools what we had in our defense we

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,620
kept using instead of introducing

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,780
actually a new learning curve we thought

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,150
that we it would have been better to

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,720
keep what we had and adapt it on a new

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:57,150
way of doing things we kept Montes

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,060
Montes is an open-source bug tracker you

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,220
know ready to put our roadmap their

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,030
discourse in order to be in touch with

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,700
the community

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,430
next cloud for our meeting notes and

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,860
jitsi for the daily standup calls the

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,960
daily standup calls was were a key

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,750
element actually to the communication

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,240
between the team will they were very

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,580
short calls of 10 minutes were people

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,490
who just mentioned what is a blocker to

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,350
them and what they will do next just

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,870
just that no questions if you would have

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:33,390
questions you would schedule a different

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:35,280
meeting even one-on-one meeting some of

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:39,180
the challenges faced was actually

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,300
deciding what is a priority and what is

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,500
not in a small team of developers there

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:50,850
is not much room of setting very high or

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:55,530
more goals so we had to be realistic on

00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:59,610
what we can actually achieve or not or

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,650
and what to expect from the community 1

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,230
what happens from the roadmap goals are

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,260
not meant managing the backup how to

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,300
manage the community involvement we had

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,880
people actually submitting very useful

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:18,180
PRS and people who will just ask for

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:22,860
features they dreamed about so where we

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:27,630
stand after 17 months of working that

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:32,040
way we have a software which is 17 times

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,690
more updated now 17 times the beta does

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,839
not mean that have been implemented only

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:40,689
17 features more it's more than that

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,240
we are parenting version 3 from 5.0

00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:46,240
which was released only 10 days ago we

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,980
have community members submitting polar

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,779
requests on every release and I'm very

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,029
happy and proud to announce that on

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,579
every single release there have been at

00:08:52,029 --> 00:09:01,029
least one community contribution and

00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:03,100
features get faster delivered back to

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,939
the community and I would also wanted to

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,339
add that the community is also involved

00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:12,839
on the testing process because about a

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:16,930
week before the final release we have

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,910
scheduled the the better release the

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:25,480
release candidate where people can

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:27,370
actually install and check it so that is

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,379
all for me it was a short presentation I

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,060
would like to thank you all for

00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:33,720
listening to me

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,720
thank you

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:58,930
so the question was how I became the

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,750
community manager of the project about

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,089
three and a half years ago in 2016 I

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,860
joined over loudspeaker space which is a

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,550
community in Tirana Albania in my

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,050
country and we organized the conference

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,240
which is named open-source conference

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,839
Albania Austin and there I had met

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,730
Fedora

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,819
I met with media and of course Belize

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,430
they had a booth there so I came in

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,839
touch started with email marketing I had

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,329
no idea what it was at the time well

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,970
justice Souter I was not interested into

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:30,519
this marketing part so I started media

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:34,269
actually developers that just work on

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:37,660
that and people got very involved and

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:40,010
about a year ago last year I also got

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,130
employed and became

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:55,310
the manager and I'm very happy it was a

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:58,340
step-by-step process yes we opened

00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,440
yesterday I think some of you organize

00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,760
their site here you can talk to us some

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,760
of them are standing next to you

00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:25,029
another one

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,529
for how did you find switching to the

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,699
city switched to a time-based release

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:32,879
schedule and how did you face now we are

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:36,879
playing base like we have monthly

00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:39,249
releases we have the release sunny day

00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,809
on the fifth and the final release on

00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:43,209
the eleventh of each month unless

00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:46,139
something urgent comes up and we

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:46,139
schedule it for a few days

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,249
yes because actually if I am using

00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:56,559
something and I don't know when an

00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:59,740
update will come like we had updates if

00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,300
you go back and check the releases from

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,220
the previous year you will see a release

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,259
every three months and then every seven

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,720
and then every five so that was not

00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:09,189
consistent and people didn't have

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,269
something to wait for because they

00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:14,259
didn't know when it will come

00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:15,879
so some now people have something to

00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,920
wait for and you know it's gonna be

00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:23,079
there and the announcements are on the

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,550
forum so I guess also if you are

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:32,949
evaluating something like should I

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:40,980
should I yeah yeah yeah is this thing

00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:40,980
dead or yeah yes yes

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,850
so so the question to summer as it is

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,950
weather was there any challenging

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,570
managing the community so the Beach PD

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,360
community actually is consisted of

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,190
people who are quite technical because

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,470
the software itself the software process

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,900
requires some technical skills in order

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,530
to install it so people actually

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,240
contributed are quite technical

00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,060
themselves and they're not

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,330
we don't expect young students to

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,880
contribute so most of these people are

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,530
the way why they get motivated as I

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,140
understand it is because they want a

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,810
software as much as complete as it could

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:46,350
be with much more features so that's why

00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:49,650
they get their hands dirty and work and

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,020
submit code all the time so there are

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,970
months and certain here it's a time

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,770
where we have more pull requests from

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,830
the community and there are months were

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,290
it's not that you know intense but still

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:05,040
the fact that it's continuous I would

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:10,790
say that's a very positive outcome from

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,790
their engagement yeah

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,180
and

00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,679
[Music]

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,760
that's bone from that question like how

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,920
technical do you need to be to be a

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,450
community manager oh you don't have to

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,670
well I'm not that technical as the

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,290
community members but what I try to

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,800
report on we have settled several

00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:59,380
community calls we where we would gather

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,630
some community members and they were we

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,720
were very interested on hearing their

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,490
feedback because as Sola mentioned which

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,820
is also part of the team some of them

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,440
are let's say risk settlers if I can

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,740
call them like that for the software

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,270
itself so they know from the inside so

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,900
we're very interested in knowing

00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:22,870
actually what they want from it how they

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,020
want to see it in the future so managing

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,830
I mean I don't write home myself I can

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,750
read but I don't write code myself so I

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:36,250
would say that you don't have to be that

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:44,350
highly technical in order to to manage

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:46,150
this group of people need to be like as

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,370
technical as the community to be the

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:57,970
community manager well what do you say

00:16:48,370 --> 00:17:00,460
kind of like on that particular case I

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,110
would say that I have been for more than

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,600
three years involved with open source

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,760
community as a community member myself

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,339
so I started actually as a volunteer

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,000
before before I get to this position so

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,250
other time I felt like the community

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,920
manager manager was the person to

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,650
actually go and ask question and guide

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,390
me until I figured out that I can do

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,010
things and just let them know but you

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,310
know I did that and this is what people

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,440
do because there are more experienced

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,720
than me and I am very happy to hear from

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,040
them what they do but they also don't

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,250
expect me to approve it somehow or I

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,200
don't know we have also more technical

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,630
people in the team so if they face

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,180
technical problems or technical issues

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,020
or the piece of code that I submit or

00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,510
github so there are other people that

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,010
can answer their questions and have them

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,580
troubleshoot anything that comes out of

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,230
the way so and it's also another thing

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,010
that they help each other

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:47,280
so they don't expect someone else to to

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:50,280
deal with their other issues so if I'm

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,790
not the technical person but for example

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,470
I'm doing email marketing right so I can

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,200
be also part of the communicate

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,410
community to like join into this

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,070
discussion and show like you know what

00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm expecting maybe

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,900
yes absolutely so another thing that I

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,950
would love to see for people is is that

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,750
our form is mainly full of technical

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,750
issues for example why try to install it

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,909
and then the database and era came up

00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,360
but I would love actually to see more

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:27,900
marketers come on the way because most

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,460
of the community not that necessarily

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,890
the community but the people involved in

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,799
this are system administrators

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,559
themselves or coders stuff like that but

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,600
I would love also to see people but use

00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:43,429
the software in order to promote their

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,049
business and make profit share tips and

00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:53,340
advices so that would be great to have

00:19:46,049 --> 00:20:00,720
such divisions like internal email

00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:03,750
marketing so yes we try to do our you

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,289
know marketing as well in some new

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:10,530
sectors and try the last one that was

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,510
sent was about a month ago where we

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,409
actually asked for people to evaluate

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:21,450
the product on other independent

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:22,800
websites and preference you have another

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,890
question yeah

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,890
[Music]

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:32,320
[Laughter]

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:56,890
yes what brings them there

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,530
we have many resellers actually have the

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,630
product it is so it is been proven that

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,940
which place is the most open popular

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:07,060
open-source product and hence it's free

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,950
and open source people are free to

00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,710
modify it so they change a lot of stuff

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:14,020
so companies actually use the product

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,420
and they truck yes they asked for that

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,560
from the system administrator to do the

00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,560
dirty job

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,209
