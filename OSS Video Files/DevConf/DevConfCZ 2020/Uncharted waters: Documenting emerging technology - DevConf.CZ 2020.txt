Title: Uncharted waters: Documenting emerging technology - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-26
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Andrew Burden

We can't help but feel the lure towards the hot new thing, especially when it comes to technology. Part of that lure is the breaking of ground, venturing into the unknown, and working on solutions to new problems. But a lot of the same things that make emerging technology fun and exciting to work on are exactly why it can be difficult to document. These challenges are quite different to those associated with mature products.

This talk is for anyone working on new products and emerging technology, or just interested in learning about fast-moving documentation. It is for the developer as much as it is for the writer, since it usually falls to them to write the early docs before a writer is added to the team.

This session will cover:
- Evolution of a docs set
- Pitfalls and obstacles to be aware of
- Some solutions
- Some kind words to anyone else in my position
