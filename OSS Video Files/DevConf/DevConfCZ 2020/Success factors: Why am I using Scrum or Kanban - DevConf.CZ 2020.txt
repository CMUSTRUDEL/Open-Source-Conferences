	Speakers: Hina Popal, Dominika Bula

When people talk about Agile, two of the most popular words that are associated with it are Scrum and Kanban. How did this happen when the Agile Manifesto is a set of values and principles that never prescribed fixed rules to follow? After working with many teams, there were common factors that enabled success regardless of which framework was being used. Those factors are built into the Scrum and Kanban processes. In this talk we will go over what the success factors are, why they are effective, and how Scrum and Kanban have built them into their processes.

The five success factors we have identified are:
- Transparency of current work (kanban or scrum board)
- Understand team priorities (grooming, top to bottom in kanban)
- Understanding scope of work and why (acceptance criteria, descriptions)
- Improving the way you actually work (retro, kaizen)
- Scoping work so you can see progress along the way (sprints, work in progress limits)
