Title: Cloud native CI CD: Tekton vs Jenkins X - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-26
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Paolo Carta

In the last few years we have seen massive changes in how we architect and design applications, with the rise of Containers, Kubernetes and Serverless Functions.

This paradigm shift had also a huge impact on the design of CI/CD tools, which are embracing the power of container orchestrators as well. In other words, those tools are starting leveraging the power of Kubernetes in terms of scalability, resiliency and infrastructure abstraction, which is truly awesome. In addition, they are portable, since they can be deployed easily on any type of cloud which provides a Kubernetes deployment.

At the moment, the most important open source projects, which are also part of the Continuous Delivery Foundation are Tekton, a former Google Project and Jenkins X, a revolutionary project from CloudBees.

This talk will describe and compare them for real world enterprise projects, pointing out their capabilities and use cases for the future.
