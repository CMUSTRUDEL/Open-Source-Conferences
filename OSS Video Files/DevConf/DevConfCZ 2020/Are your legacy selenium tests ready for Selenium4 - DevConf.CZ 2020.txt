Title: Are your legacy selenium tests ready for Selenium4 - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-02-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Kanchan Katare

With the upcoming release of Selenium 4, the Selenium project is moving from a JSON Wire protocol to a W3C protocol for selenium- browser communication and eventually all browser vendors will stop supporting the old protocol for their latest browsers. Therefore if your application’s browser policy states a support to latest versions of modern browsers then you will **have** to migrate your existing tests to Selenium 4 (W3C) when it comes out officially in few months.
This project is right now in Alpha 4 stage and available for testing via a maven repo. In this talk we will walk you through what to expect from Selenium 4 and how to be prepared for this migration.
We will also show code snippets and examples with alpha 4 and its new features like ‘relative locators’ .
The point which we are trying to make through this talk is that unlike the earlier Selenium releases Selenium 4 has a major architectural change and migrating legacy selenium tests is not going to be optional .
