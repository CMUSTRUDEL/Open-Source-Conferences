The path to Red Hat-as-a-Service.
Red Hat does managed services. We do DevOps in the style of the Google SRE Book. We’re a decent sized and growing org that supports customers 24/7. &nbsp;Our team is at the forefront of operationalizing OpenShift 4’s revolutionary set of capabilities, and are a way-to-market for many of Red Hat’s newest portfolio offerings.

As a company founded on Open Source principals, Red Hat’s SRE have a unique point of view around what it takes to actually operate and SLA open source software. &nbsp;In this talk, Red Hat’s managed services architects will discuss what it takes to write truly operable open source software. &nbsp;From fostering an observability-first mentality and feedback-loop driven development, to Operators as SRE force-multipliers and the changing role of CI/CD in a cloud-native world, we’ll pull back the curtain and walk through lessons learned over the last year.
