Virgil 3D GPU is a popular virtual GPU designed for QEMU. Currently, it supports only Linux guests and OpenGL API. For Windows guests, a special driver is required. What's more, Windows prefers Direct3D over OpenGL API. This presentation is about developing a graphics driver for Virgil 3D GPU on Windows guests to support Direct3D.
