Title: Dev Testing challenges with microservices and CD - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Mark Turansky, Abhishek Gupta

With a modern-day service, there is ever-increasing pressure to release early and often. The situation is further exacerbated with microservices as these are deployed independently. Traditional quality assurance processes cannot cope with this high degree of agility as there is no time for testing to be “out-of-phase” with development. Given this, developer and QE roles have to be fundamentally reimagined.

In this talk, we’ll go over similar challenges that we faced while building OpenShift Cluster Manager, a microservices based SaaS offering (deployed on top of OpenShift) at Red Hat. We’ll cover the incremental process changes and approaches taken to drive test automation and close collaboration between development and QE teams. The talk does not intend to be prescriptive and instead aims to highlight challenges faced as well as lessons learned along the way that can be helpful for any development or QE team, especially those deploying their applications/services on OpenShift.
