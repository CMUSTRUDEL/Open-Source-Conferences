Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Prathamesh Chavan

I am a Tech Support Engineer at Red Hat and have been managing the Mozilla communities across the globe since 2015. Link: https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/
Every volunteer joins an Open Source community for a reason. The reasons could range from technical gains to finding his/her/their passion. This community of diverse volunteers require a leader who can not just mentor them with their interests but also a manager managing the community activities in terms of community engagement and planning. A community manager is not less than a candle of light and in this presentation, I would be highlighting my learnings and experiences about starting a community from scratch around a project and maintaining a healthy community management practices.
A volunteer interested in community mgmt. can best benefit out of this presentation.
