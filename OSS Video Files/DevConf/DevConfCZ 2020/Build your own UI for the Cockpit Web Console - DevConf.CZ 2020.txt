Title: Build your own UI for the Cockpit Web Console - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Lars Karlitski, Andreas Nilsson

The Cockpit Web Console provides a graphical, browser-based interface for managing your Fedora Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system. It gives less experienced Linux users the ability to perform common OS tasks on local, remote, and virtual machines without using the command line. But in some cases, the built-in tools is not enough for tasks that are specific to your organization.

In this talk, we’ll show you how you can build a custom UI as a plugin for the Web Console, to make your common system management tasks accessible to less experienced colleagues. This can free up some of your time and allow you to focus on other things.

We’ll go through writing a simple page which interacts with a custom script, packaging it up, and distributing it across your organization. Only basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is required.
