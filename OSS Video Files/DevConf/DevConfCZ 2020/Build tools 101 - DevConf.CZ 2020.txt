Have you ever wondered how modern JS apps are built? Or how it was done in the old times, like 2 years ago? This is the right place to learn basics about Webpack, Parcel, Rollup and history of build tools used in JS world. I will guide you trough the dark ages of grunt and gulp. The problematic era of first webpack scripts and we will end in modern era of buitd tools and libraries - Babel, Typescript, linters and many more. At the end you should be able to set different build processes based on your preferences with optional code minificatio and code splitting using either Webpack, Parcel or plain Babel or Typescript compiler.
