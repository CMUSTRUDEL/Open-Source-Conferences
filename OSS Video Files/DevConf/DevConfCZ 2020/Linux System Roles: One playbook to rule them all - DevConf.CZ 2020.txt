Publication date: 2020-03-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Terry Bowling, Pavel Cahyna

One often encountered problem in system administration is evolution of interfaces (such as configuration file formats and various utilities) between operating system releases. Linux System Roles with Ansible help to solve automation incompatibilities introduced by OS changes by presenting a stable and abstract interface.
Attendees will learn about newly added and improved roles in Linux System Roles project and about using them to configure Fedora, RHEL or CentOS systems consistently across multiple releases. The audience is assumed to have a basic understanding of Ansible and experience with Linux (preferably Fedora-derived) system administration.
