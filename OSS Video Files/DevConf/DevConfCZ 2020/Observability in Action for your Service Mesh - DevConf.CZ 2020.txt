Title: Observability in Action for your Service Mesh - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-02-28
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Xavier Canal Masjuan

Microservice Architectures break up the monolith into many smaller pieces and introduce new communication patterns between services like fault tolerance and dynamic routing. A Service Mesh like Istio provides these traffic control capabilities on a platform level and frees the application writers from those tasks, allowing them to focus on business logic. One of the major challenges with the management of a microservices architecture is trying to understand how services are composed, how they are connected and how all components operate from a global perspective to a particular detail. Kiali works with Istio to visualize the service mesh topology and describe how they are connected. In this session we will explore several microservices scenarios discussing observability practices and showing how Kiali integrates graph, health, metrics, traces, and the configuration of your Service Mesh.
