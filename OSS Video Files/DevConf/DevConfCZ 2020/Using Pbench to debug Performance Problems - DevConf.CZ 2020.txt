Title: Using Pbench to debug Performance Problems - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Peter Portante

The Performance Engineering team at Red Hat has been developing a tool and infrastructure called Pbench, which helps collect, in a complete and consistent manner, data about the execution of a benchmark, including the configuration data of the systems involved. We'll show you the power of having the configuration data along side arbitrary tool/metric data collected to make it easier to understand complex performance issues of distributed systems.
