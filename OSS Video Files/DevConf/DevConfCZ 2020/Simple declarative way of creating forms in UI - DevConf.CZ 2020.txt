Do you hate developing forms in web environment? Data driven forms is here to rescue you! Data driven forms is a React library which renders forms UI based on predefined JSON schema. It handles all state updates for you, validation, conditions, customization and more. Instead of duplicating existing forms, you will have more time for improving your UX, test your UI and make it more stable. and There are many libraries that use the same principle, however they are restricted to specific technologies and design systems. Data driven forms allows you to create your own components and the schema is defined by your components API and not by anything else.
