Title: Introducing OSBuild - DevConf.CZ 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-27
Playlist: DevConfCZ 2020
Description: 
	Speakers: Lars Karlitski, Tom Gundersen

OSBuild is a generic low-level tool for creating OS images. It is the new backend for Image Builder, and it is designed to make the definition and creation of OS images transparent, predictable, modifiable and reproducible. An OS image is fully specified in a declarative configuration format, which means that a given configuration always produces functionally equivalent images, regardless of what host they are generated on. We wish to facilitate future OS development and experimentation, by providing a plug-in architecture that should be easy to hook into for people hacking on OS images. This talk goes through the architecture of osbuild, describes some of the challenges it overcame, and outlines the possible road ahead.
