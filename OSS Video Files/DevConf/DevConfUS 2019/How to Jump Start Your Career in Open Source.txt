	Speaker: Eric D. Schabell

It's not coincidence. It's not luck. It's not going to happen by itself, so what's the secret sauce? Understanding what makes a career in open source grow, what choices are crucial, and what actions accelerate or damage your open source future are sometimes hard to grasp. Learning to position, expand and grow your personal brand in the open source world is what this session provides. Be ready for your next step in open source. Join me for an hour of power where you'll be given a clear and easy to use plan for jump starting your open source career immediately.

much better so welcome my name is Eric

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,340
Chappell

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,270
I guess you wanted to do that didn't you

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,440
go ahead is Eric Chappelle I think I

00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,119
think he knows what he's doing

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,680
yeah please welcome to done this before

00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:21,620
I work at Red Hat been I've been in open

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,650
source for probably 20 some years now

00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,230
I'm older than I look I'm told I've been

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,150
at Red Hat ten years this talk is very

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,800
different from most of the stuff you've

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,820
seen here while I guarantee it's

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,950
different than most of stuff you've seen

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,030
here it's also something that I've only

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,040
started doing the last couple of years

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:44,090
and it's been a featured keynote to open

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,950
up conferences for example I was in

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,020
split croatia you know where that is but

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,680
it's like a vacation destination

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,290
think of Greece same idea and I was in

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,840
the National Opera House on a stage this

00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,800
is the coolest place I've ever talked

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,260
have you ever seen when they do those

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,390
shows on TV like cabarets or comedians

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,710
and it's all golden boxes and stuff

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,689
around a minute that's what it was like

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,859
so I came out on stage and I was kind of

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,240
like I was kind of looking at everything

00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,639
more than they were looking at me I was

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,619
like holy God this is cool here you can

00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:15,179
find that online it's pretty much the

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,520
same title it's on YouTube you can

00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:18,569
you're gonna watch that a little bit or

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,029
you could pay attention right now

00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:24,329
whatever you want to do what we're going

00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:25,529
to talk about is kind of fuzzy stuff

00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,100
right this has got nothing to do with

00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:31,859
technical stuff but every single one of

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,369
you and I should start with who are you

00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:38,579
like who's a developer here who does

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:43,789
nothing with technology at all here hey

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,929
there's always one who has been in

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:50,450
technology or any kind of work around

00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:57,509
this area for say more than ten years

00:01:50,450 --> 00:02:02,189
three four five years a couple of years

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,380
who's a student okay so so we got a nice

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,340
mix of everything and the funny part is

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,679
what I'm going to tell you what we're

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,300
going to talk about this applies to all

00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:11,430
of you from the beginning all the way

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,060
through so let's ask a few more

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,200
questions how many people here right

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,640
and I don't mean papers for your

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,190
president for you for your class or

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,890
whatever but blog posts do they twist

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,300
your arms do it or is it a voluntary

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,600
thing

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,959
does anybody have written a book that's

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,500
kind of way out there I get that who's

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,880
written an article in the last month see

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,870
how there's like no oh there's one hand

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,690
one hand only so we've got probably I'm

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,630
just guessing several hundred years of

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,940
experience in this room working in IT or

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,800
something related to that and there's

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,290
one person that shared something this

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,209
last month what's wrong with this

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,010
picture

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:02,280
where are we standing right now we're in

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,739
a university what do we do here we share

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,120
what am i doing right now how many

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,380
people here have given a talk in the

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,080
last month oh that's a little better

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,750
why do you do that to share something

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,150
right when I did this as a keynote at a

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,790
place it was a technical day for Red Hat

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,400
we had about 500 people in the room and

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,930
I don't think when I asked about the age

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
groups and the different levels of

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,350
experience I think most of them were

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,450
gray hair at old men that had been

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,100
working a long time and there was only

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,870
three that raised their hands that even

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,440
did any kind of sharing and reading and

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,320
or blogging and stuff like that that's

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,480
criminal right you don't want to be the

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,940
old guy in the corner someplace like a

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,790
bank it has the seat molded to his butt

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,829
and does not share anything because

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,880
that's job security you ever heard the

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:56,250
phrase security through obscurity that's

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,519
awful that's not what you want to do

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,910
these days right where do you think

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,920
open-source comes from sharing and you

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,630
look at anything and I've been living

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,590
this since day one I got really lucky I

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,820
went and I'm from America originally I

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,130
was in the military got out overseas

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,070
stayed in Holland I met a girl that's

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,220
why I ended up there I studied there my

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,660
teacher was talking about heard of him

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,099
so he does this thing around MINIX and

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,360
operating systems but you can't really

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,530
install it anywhere because there's no

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,440
tcp/ip stack so we use Linux

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,240
long time ago that's how I got into it

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,430
from that point on everything I did I

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,810
shared and it's open and you can always

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,160
find the problem you can always go

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,990
further all those things you always hear

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,389
about code and stuff so I basically

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,130
applied that to everything I do and the

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,480
best day of my life was when Red Hat

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,020
called said hey you want to come work on

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,730
open source you don't get paid to work

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,590
on open source when I tell people what I

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:59,660
do we sell free software you know I'm

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,450
saying it's like think about this these

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,770
are these are not oxymorons

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,990
what we're gonna talk about today three

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,930
things first of all you I've already

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,850
started poking but it all starts with

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,470
you everything about what's going to

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,350
change in your life needs to happen now

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,060
and it comes through you right has

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,490
nothing to do with anything else okay

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,530
how cool the software is okay how cool

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,950
the company is if you don't do it it's

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:28,040
not gonna happen so remember that second

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,419
thing is really easy sharing how old are

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,250
those two kids right there that's where

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,130
it started trust me you've been sharing

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:40,580
since you were very very small why'd you

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:43,190
stop Society isn't mine mine mine is it

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:48,680
is it I don't know what American baby it

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:52,810
is now and it's about growth growth as

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,520
an easy path it's really easy trust me

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,740
so when we look at you I've asked a few

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,120
questions already I can't stress enough

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,229
wherever you work I don't care where

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,710
there's an open source or a closed

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,020
source or a super private IP company or

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,640
whatever you have colleagues next to you

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,180
you have colleagues behind you you have

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,650
bosses you have kids at home you have

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,330
days at schools where you can talk about

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,220
your job with your kids right you have

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:20,150
all kinds of places you can share do you

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,820
do that you have pizza evenings where

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,440
you guys hack at work heard of those

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,880
things meetups you be able to go to a

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,250
meet-up have you presented it a meet-up

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,630
I don't care what you do either I don't

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,100
care if you're a manager I don't care if

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,720
you're a lawyer I don't care you know

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,669
lawyers a red hat actually do stuff like

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
this it's really funny it's like

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,900
watching a turtle come out of a shell

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,340
they're really really not about sharing

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,720
right

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,160
then they got to come out and explain

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,900
all these really complex laws to us

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,980
about the IP and what these new things

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,630
mean everybody I don't care what you do

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,730
has something to share if you've done

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,980
anything even as a student if you've

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,180
been programming for three months you've

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,540
been playing with some library that I

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,050
know all about so tell me about it

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,760
write about it tweet about it whatever

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,910
you guys are doing snapchat about it

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:11,770
it's whatever it takes I mean it's it's

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,120
so ridiculously easy so these I never

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,280
never thought in my life I'd be giving

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
this talk out of university so it's

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,250
really funny when I put this up cuz yeah

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,400
you remember University yeah yeah

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,530
yesterday so it all started here when

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,590
you're kind of like that original

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,480
curiosity everything's new everything

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,400
you're running into and in my case open

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,870
source quite quickly everything I was

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,260
doing was like Google something look for

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,880
it online find somebody's blog you never

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,530
know what you share is gonna hit

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,980
somebody or go crazy or go ballistic

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,940
anybody know what slash dog is I don't

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,410
know if that's still a thing over here

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,060
is it is it still kind of active or it

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,720
used to be huge right it used to be the

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,130
thing I did a very small Linux install

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,270
course I don't remember what version it

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,190
was walking through some really stupid

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,550
easy stuff put it online somebody slash

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:03,430
spotted me didn't know what that was at

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,500
the time either but my websites being

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,780
hosted by Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,150
and a little company that had two

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,880
servers and on the server where mine was

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,490
was also the two biggest new sites in

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,130
Holland and they crashed it because I

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,690
didn't use caching so we're talking like

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,980
gigabytes per second or whatever of

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,480
traffic and it just completely I was a

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,100
server and then that means the new sites

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,230
were also offline because it was a mess

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,210
everything you're doing in the beginning

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,370
is learning from other people imagine if

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,630
nobody shared their first

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,610
experience would be looking at blank

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,230
screen it used to be like that huh

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,740
anybody remember buying Microsoft

00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,500
products in a box yeah you got a CD in

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,330
the book and good luck really that's all

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,270
it is right is that how you want life to

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,380
be not me

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,610
everything I have you could shoot you

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,490
reuse share and do anything

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,220
so I hammer a lot on the word

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,810
open-source but apply that to everything

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,340
right I mean it doesn't have to be a

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,040
religion do I look like I'm not

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,360
showering and you know living in the

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,710
woods and you know trying to get

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,610
off-grid and all that kind of crazy

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:17,180
no I mean I have an iPhone I want stuff

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:20,070
that works right open-source is about

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,680
getting into that mindset and realizing

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,700
that sharing is caring all right it's

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,860
really that simple

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,230
the more open stuff is the more

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,510
standardized stuff is the better we're

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,250
all off and time and time again we

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,620
learned that who here remembers when

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:38,339
container started there was one

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,330
container engine what was a cult you're

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,020
not that old come on

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:46,040
yes docker right you bet here work for

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,160
docker before hammer on your company

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,360
just easy they came out with whatever

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,770
they were doing with these containers

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,300
right that took off like a bottle

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,810
rocket everybody was on that one that

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,370
was it

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,740
it's a really good lesson on how not to

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,030
do it what's the first thing that starts

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,440
happening when somebody gets a little

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,870
bit of a disagreement with the company

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,000
that owns technology like that it's time

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,030
to make a standard now I have an open

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,500
container initiative OCI that means we

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,200
define how an engine is supposed to work

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,820
and people program an engine based on

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,310
the standard now you can use whatever

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,200
the hell you want docker is becoming

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,770
irrelevant has the only toolset to

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,180
manage your containers right there's a

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,410
little bit more behind that story Google

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,060
the online you can figure out why

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,320
they blew it but they tried to open

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,820
source but then all the little pieces

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,860
and that's not really sharing that's

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,339
just trying to manipulate people are

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,500
stupid

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:38,310
there's people much more religious about

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,589
this than me and it all goes sideways so

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,420
in the beginning you're digging around

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:46,050
trying to become professional right try

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,260
to become anybody here programmer that's

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,400
fine

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,490
what do you other guys doing you're

00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,230
missing out on all the fun I started

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,330
pretty late at school I think I was 28

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,400
when I first started studying for my

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,050
masters I hadn't touched a computer at

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,330
all I was a marine so that's to tell you

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,620
kind of where my mindset was right how I

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,090
got into computers was more of an

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,830
accident than anything else but the

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,120
thing that caught me was day one I knew

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,160
I was in the right class because we were

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,010
programming and there's nothing cooler

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,180
than trying to solve those puzzles right

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,800
some freaky language you don't know how

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,640
to do anything it's really really cool

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,960
but then all of a sudden you're gonna

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,070
roll out of school for the people who

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,480
haven't done it yeah and you start

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,450
getting anybody done like part-time jobs

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,890
in a real company they come in there and

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,150
they say hey write a webservice like oh

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,190
yeah I can do that I do that I'm gonna

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,620
laugh tube all the time you do that in a

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,390
company what happens it's a whole

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,370
different ball of wax so much more

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,550
complicated you got all these buzzwords

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,410
containers all kinds of stuff my first

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,650
job out of school was at IBM believe it

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,620
or not part time and I only did it

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,030
because I expensed my school you got to

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,330
understand school in Holland is about

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,470
3,000 a year so I got lucky doing school

00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,960
over there and not doing it in this

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,270
building no debt

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:04,810
I was expensing my school and my books

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:08,450
and working part-time and it was a db2

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,930
logistics area of IBM we're talking

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:14,390
about tables with like if you do a join

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,460
it is so big it's worldwide the parts

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,290
and stuff is so big that it does not

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,570
come out of the printer and you're like

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,400
what happened and then tomorrow a truck

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,690
shows up with all these boxes of the

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,040
 you tried to print out because it

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,870
goes to a book printing station

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,640
someplace and everybody in your

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,170
department knows is these are older guys

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,580
and they just laugh at you because then

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,980
you come in your desk is covered in

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,120
these boxes of print house and I'm

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,350
 myself think I'm gonna get

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,650
fired for spending all that money on

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:44,750
paper you program something and you push

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,820
it to death and it disappears it's not

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,500
on your screen anymore it's gone I mean

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,300
this is how complicated things are in

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,770
real life right it gets way more

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,710
complicated you're constantly learning

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,090
constantly trying to prove yourself

00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,420
anybody here has been doing IT for a

00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:02,500
while have you ever stopped learning why

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,500
are you here on a Saturday

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,059
I'm impressed this is the busiest room

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,430
I've seen so far you guys are the only

00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:13,220
smart ones this is the best session

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,279
you're gonna see I'm not kidding I mean

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,529
it's based on feedback if you take what

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,990
you hear today continue to do this

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,519
you're gonna be highly successful you're

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,369
gonna get job opportunities and stuff

00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,230
that you never thought you'd get I don't

00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:28,999
go hunting jobs people come to me you

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,379
know why cuz I share push out there and

00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:33,589
if you're Google stuff people find you

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:35,209
you help people that's why people want

00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,649
to be nurses and doctors and things like

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:40,100
that it's not to be a famous nurse and

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,629
doctors to help people right nothing

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,949
makes me happier than someone sends me a

00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:44,209
little email or a note says oh that's

00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,339
great thank you you saved my ass

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:48,860
I'll tell you a really funny story I've

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,279
been doing it for a while working in the

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,149
Middle where bu of our company doing BPM

00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,759
and BRMS mostly so that's business rules

00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:01,429
business processes that kind of stuff

00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,709
I'm a huge fan of the very simple basic

00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:05,360
steps first how do you install it how do

00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,189
you start it how do you make a project

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,540
how do you make you know the first code

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:10,809
your first deployment all that kind of

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,220
stuff so I fill all these buckets this

00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:15,259
means that our sales guys can go out and

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,610
you don't have to go out the customers

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:19,220
find this stuff play with it and then

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,899
come to them I had not gone down to

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,429
South America cuz I live in Europe and

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,350
that's a long flight to go down there

00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,699
and like train people and do stuff and

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,559
who doesn't want to go to Brazil who

00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,179
doesn't want to go to Peru who doesn't

00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:30,439
want to go so all the other people my

00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,420
team wanted to go I said go ahead I'll

00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:33,800
just stay home so I didn't go for about

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,929
five years and they kept coming back and

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:41,329
telling me hey they're really really

00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:42,709
really big fans of you down there and I

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,069
finally went down after about eight

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,629
years and the whole team of essays met

00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:50,959
me at the door and in South America

00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:52,639
they're a little bit more warm I guess

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,589
you could say and then when they greet

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,049
each other they kiss on the cheek at

00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:58,369
least in Brazil when I was there and

00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:00,170
they were lined up waiting for me at

00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:01,879
7:00 in the morning to all one by one

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,790
hug me and say I see you saved my house

00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,110
so many times that makes my day you know

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm saying you don't need to pay me do

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:13,840
that that's really really fun

00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:17,170
okay so what do you want to do with this

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,550
IT stuff right and I don't think just

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,510
constantly learning new technologies

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,620
exactly why you're in it is it you want

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,050
to be rich y'all working through the

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,600
night looking for the IPO and cash out

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:32,920
and go live on an island that would suck

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,710
at 28 wouldn't it you want to build cool

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,490
 right finally I get to use this

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:41,200
slide in Boston I'm a big Red Sox fan

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,640
play baseball my whole life I write for

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,830
a fan blog not so much anymore I'm a

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,050
little too busy but I really like it I

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:50,670
was there last night great stuff

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:54,160
they suck this year I know but whatever

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,230
and you want all the coolest tools right

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,160
you want to do all the fun stuff and you

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,450
want to have the cool this toolbox and

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,710
you want the playground to play and you

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,210
want to be able to use all these nice

00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:10,450
little tools and these open-source

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:15,460
things right right no I see the stickers

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:16,780
on all your stuff but most importantly

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,160
you want to have impact so that's what

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,200
I've been described describing whether

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,360
my impact is based on software I wrote I

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,770
have no illusions there's no software

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,410
I'm writing that's even gonna live past

00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,330
three years old probably ah one

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,150
exception one exception I worked at a

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:35,500
bank in Holland and I wrote one of my

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:39,190
first services there was a post zip code

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,320
check it's one line you can't optimize

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,760
this and really funny enough one of my

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,210
friends who used to work with me there

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,770
went to a outsource company outside and

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,510
got hired back in like five years later

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,370
I was digging around and found our

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,810
original 1.0 document for that they're

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,270
still using my service and my name's

00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,530
still on it so maybe just maybe if the

00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,670
bank doesn't die there might be

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,450
something floating out there for me

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,620
awhile all right so that's about you

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:07,270
guys and where you're going or what

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,390
you're looking to do now how we can do

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,390
it

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,959
it's very very very easy you've been

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:19,040
doing it since you were this big just

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:22,000
share you guys have if you have does

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,350
eBay here have a blog themselves

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,919
someplace you consistently write at or

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,900
whatever

00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:32,750
what's the copyright on that do you know

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:38,090
do you care you just steal

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:39,410
everywhere and publish it or I've said

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,210
it before right open starts with you

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,100
guys it's it's about how you want to

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,260
position what you're doing if you look

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,270
at the bottom of my website my blog or

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,299
whatever since day one I've had like

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,490
this creative commons that's the most

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:56,090
it's in the art section it's meant to

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:59,179
cover art originally but writing I guess

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,860
falls under artistic stuff and I want it

00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,480
as free and as open as I can get it and

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,429
that's as far as I can get it I think it

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,570
can be reused copied and mangled or

00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,700
whatever the hell you want to do I don't

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,030
care everything I've done since 2005 I

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:14,679
guess have fun

00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,679
tear it up so I want me

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,140
when you look at where you work not

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,020
everybody has the luxury of what we do

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,870
at Red Hat where it's like it's a thing

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,580
so how many people here work in a

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:34,309
company that's got more than 10,000

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:36,559
employees now keep your hands up that's

00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:39,380
three of you right now view three with

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,820
her four with your hands up how many of

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,980
you have written an email telling your

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:48,190
CEO directly he made a mistake more than

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,190
once

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,200
red hat is a meritocracy they call it

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,080
and it's just like open source anybody

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,830
ever worked on an open source project

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,480
somebody doesn't like what direction

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,120
it's going they all jump in and tell you

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,309
how shitty your decision is right

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,750
sometimes not very nicely but most the

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:10,549
time is not too bad most of it that's

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,790
exactly what it's like inside a Red Hat

00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,160
believe it or not our whole company

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,410
functions like this blew my mind when I

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,830
came in I subscribed to probably about

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,120
50 mailing lists because everything in

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,650
my company runs like an open source

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,650
project so everything's a mailing list

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,900
people are not afraid to tell somebody

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,130
when they make a decision whether you're

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,690
a leader or whether you're not a leader

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,850
and it's quite shocking it's quite funny

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,340
to watch somebody come in from Oracle

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,640
and be put in a director's position make

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,590
a decision and I was standing in a in

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,150
Boston at the hinds Convention Center

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,350
having coffee with him because he's

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,490
thinking before I go to the airport I'm

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,110
gonna tell him he's got a line up and do

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,100
what I told him to do and I look him in

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,600
the eye and tell me you're making a

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,710
fucked-up decision and they're like and

00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,090
I'm like dude if you want to fire me

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,309
fair enough but that's I'm calling

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,200
 you know it's it's I'm not

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,460
egotistical don't get this wrong I'm not

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,190
better than anybody else that is not

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,510
what it's about it's a bad decision you

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,100
know I wasn't the only one telling him

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,299
what's just funny

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,080
it just keeps hearing the same thing all

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:15,970
the time right

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,970
it's a good one for you to use it

00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:23,390
these are some of the things you find on

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:24,890
our walls on all our offices so it's

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,970
hard not to be motivated at work when

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,560
you see stuff like this right and I

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,090
could talk about it now IBM just bought

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:39,200
us right they bought us very carefully

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:43,490
what do we own nothing no buildings no

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,260
software every patent that's been done

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,300
by somebody from us goes into the patent

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,820
pool where everybody shares it's

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:53,750
protected the only thing they own is the

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:56,180
people that are still working there they

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,270
pay thirty four billion dollars for us

00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,220
right sounds nuts right they'll probably

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,890
earn that back on this in about five six

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,620
maybe seven years it's not so crazy that

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,970
is it but they're risking one-third of

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,770
their to get our stuff because of

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,290
these ideas because of the way we work

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,760
inside they're doing all they can not to

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,250
change this not the MER just not to

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,980
acquire us not to have too many of the

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,480
IBM errs get involved and mess it up

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,660
they want our culture to remain the same

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,100
they want our culture to spread I don't

00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,050
know what its gonna result in maybe it's

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,970
all crap in two years I'm not working

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,490
here no more or somebody else's

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,950
destroyed read happen you don't even see

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,780
IBM as a company over you know red had a

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,180
company of I'd nothing nothing has

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,520
changed same HR same everything that's

00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,910
crazy

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,900
my favorite because we could put a big

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:52,370
ole exclamation point at the end of this

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:54,260
it's kind of how it works who doesn't

00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,690
run into open-source in their companies

00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,240
now it's pretty weird if your CIO I'm

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,130
not doing open-source at all it's just

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,900
not happening and that is so different

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,390
from ten even ten years ago when I first

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,010
started you know 90% of my I was a

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,780
Solutions Architect the first three

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,160
years and you're 90% of my discussions

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,280
are about trying to convince you why you

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,480
shouldn't be using community stuff

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,710
because I went through it at the bank we

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,480
did our first implementation with

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,610
community stuff tried to do the second

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,220
implementation updated one component and

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,399
all kinds of crap breaks who hasn't gone

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,979
through that in an architect

00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:28,289
sure yet besides the students wait till

00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:29,700
you get out there it sounds like a good

00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:32,700
idea at the time but when you get to

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,960
actual enterprise stuff like what what

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,719
you're doing in organizations it gets

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,249
complicated and has legacy stuff it's

00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:39,659
really nice to have components that are

00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:42,119
open-source that are stable for three

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:44,879
years right guaranteed the api's aren't

00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,440
gonna change that developers can count

00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,940
on that and continue to program against

00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,679
that and everything I deploy still works

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,589
the libraries don't get flipped the next

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,679
release

00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:56,999
so as you're growing as you're sharing

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,320
you start bridging the gap to these

00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:01,369
people and you're gonna start noticing

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,679
that you're basically a teacher

00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:06,409
everybody should be a teacher I'll care

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,759
whether you're teaching about how to

00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:09,950
underwater basket weave because that's

00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,839
your thing

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,210
bicycling baking cakes it really doesn't

00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,259
matter look at YouTube man every kid in

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,399
the world thinks he's gonna be a rich

00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,969
youtuber because they're sharing about

00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:23,549
how to put on makeup at 12 years old

00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:25,190
maybe so you know what they're doing the

00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:30,389
same thing

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:31,759
it's absolutely viral right so why why

00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:36,059
aren't you guys doing it

00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:39,149
watch your kids man I'm not saying put

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:42,239
your bank account online there's a limit

00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:45,210
to what you want to share but it's

00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:46,799
really up to you it's really really up

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,299
to you I can say this all day long and

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,249
you go back home and you do nothing

00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:52,549
different than you did yesterday

00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:52,549
nothing's going to change

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,380
it's really funny I can tell in this

00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,640
talk there's almost nobody like in their

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,850
phone and not paying attention

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,180
everybody's looking at me so you're all

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:09,600
thinking about it like this is so

00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,730
obvious so here's some tips along the

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,610
lines of how do we do this sharing and

00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,800
stuff right right right I don't care if

00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,120
you don't like it or not keep trying you

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,590
know what's great about this stuff when

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,810
you want to do a blog or whatever or

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,820
medium calm or any place you want to put

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,070
this stuff you don't have to write a

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,210
book

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,420
nobody's gonna read any farther than one

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:33,330
screen anyway so make it fit if you got

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,920
more to say make it part 2 part 3 I got

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,600
three articles playing them over the

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,420
next three weeks you get a fourth

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,890
article you now written for a month see

00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:47,610
how that happens it's real easy I have

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:49,290
so after they crashed my blog with slash

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,790
talk I went over to Google's blogger

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,140
thing just because they're the best at

00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,910
hosting all the and cache new stuff

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,710
and SEO and I don't have to worry about

00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,080
it and manage it myself all the one do

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,750
is write so anytime I have an idea I

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,820
open up a new article I put Draft at the

00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,380
beginning maybe whip out a quick title

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,980
maybe paste a link in and I'll come back

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,230
to it later

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,390
that's just my bookmarks for ideas to

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,180
write about it I always have about 8 to

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,130
10 rolling at any one time right now I

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,330
have all right before the started all

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,010
these slides will be available

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,740
they went online 10 minutes before we

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:25,890
started that was stage stuff I put up

00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,940
before that stuff that is not all of it

00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,860
but that's all that was fit on the

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:32,250
screen you can see the number of blogs I

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,900
did for articles I did per year I'll be

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,730
honest it all started out as me being a

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,050
developer and just bookmarking work that

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,970
was so complicated and we're gonna look

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:44,160
for it again still one of my top three

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,600
visited articles you never know you

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,030
never know when you put something online

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,590
what its gonna be maybe nobody looks at

00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:53,130
it maybe it becomes the most famous

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,140
thing you've ever written I was working

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,900
on a piece of code it's two classes one

00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,460
class basically takes any object you

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,890
give it as if sit up and puts it in a

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,810
database so it's serializing they call

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,190
that and then you have to unsere lies

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,260
and unzip it when you take it out so you

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,940
can use it in your code

00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,289
those two things are the top three

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,120
people are still looking that up that

00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:15,000
was based on JBoss code for my four

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,320
point one or something we are so far

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,510
beyond that we're like at eight now or

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,909
something I can't imagine what people

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:25,649
are doing with that code I hope they're

00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:30,000
not running JBoss for but anyway another

00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:32,370
stupid one was fixing WordPress would

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,870
give me a blank screen at some point and

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,970
it was some stupid version and it was a

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,889
bug and if you did something with a flag

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,480
it would fix it people are pounding that

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:46,169
pounding that how to make an ESO to burn

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,510
remember burning stuff to CDs somewhere

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,789
in that crowd probably way back by 2008

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:55,350
and 7 is an article about how to do that

00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:57,899
on a Mac figure it out and command-line

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:02,190
to do all that properly those are

00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:04,830
my top three stupid just never know

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,419
never know but I don't have to look all

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,399
over the internet to find this stuff I

00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:09,929
was doing at the time I could Google

00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,059
what I was looking for plus my name and

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,779
it pop up on my site and so that's

00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,789
pretty cool

00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,230
you'll see later here about twenty

00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:17,639
thousand eleven two thousand twelve then

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,200
it starts getting focused and that's the

00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:21,029
tip I can give you up ahead of time I

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,559
was all over the place in the beginning

00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:24,750
I was writing about cycling that I was

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,059
doing I was writing about baseball I was

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,679
writing about all kinds of crazy stuff

00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:32,630
there's no coherency there you're not

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:35,820
gonna get an audience it's kind of chaos

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,440
so from 2011-12 if you look at the top

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,000
of my site it says very distinctly in

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,470
the small description what I talk about

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,330
there and that's all I talk about there

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,490
if you want to talk about baking which

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,350
really doesn't apply to IT make a baking

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,960
website it's a lot easier for everybody

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,190
to find and to focus on what you're

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,289
doing same thing for your social media

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,970
I'd have like for Twitter accounts

00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:55,440
because some of them are baseball some

00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,440
of them are that was a really bad

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,059
experience I started writing I think

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,730
around 2013 when they won the World

00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:06,090
Series I did it on the one that was

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:09,630
already famous for all the IT stuff at

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:11,100
about 5,000 followers on Twitter you

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,320
post a photo that's really nice of

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,299
Fenway Park with a sunset you don't

00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,639
realize how big the Red Sox Nation is

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,600
worldwide it's huge it's like within

00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:21,820
five minutes you have 200,000

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,230
or something on that that's great when

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,610
the game's going on but then all the IT

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,380
people are like what the hell is this

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,870
and then when you go back to talking

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,309
about the other stuff and the baseball

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,780
people are like what's this so I kind of

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,600
mismatched it all and then later pulled

00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:38,980
it apart so that's a tip focus on what

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:41,559
you're going to talk about anything

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,960
you're writing about or reading about or

00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:47,380
working on doesn't require you to write

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,600
an article like if you right now coding

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:52,150
in my class on something here or in my

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,039
session and you're you think of this

00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,870
kind of cool you can put a little thing

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,700
on Twitter and say this is the link to

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,070
the code I just wrote I'm gonna publish

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,230
it later you know every week you are

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,020
doing something that somebody probably

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:08,710
could read about even if it's just a

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,179
hundred characters not everybody has

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,770
time to write every week I get that

00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:13,539
maybe some people don't like to maybe

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,940
you write in other languages I have

00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:18,280
somebody I know that writes Japanese for

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,809
me he takes my stuff because he doesn't

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,030
want to generate the content but he does

00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:23,289
know how to do the Japanese so I let him

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,250
translate the stuff and just put a link

00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,690
in I'm pretty soon before you know you

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,220
start getting crazy stuff like this

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:35,980
where people are just like oh I love all

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:38,289
you stuff maybe and this is an example I

00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,780
use from some internal stuff we have we

00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:42,760
generate like t-shirts with with low

00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,520
slogans on them and stuff stickers that

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,370
you see on the laptops but maybe your

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,900
thing is podcasts or YouTube video

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,520
sitting down and talking about stuff I

00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,320
mean there's nothing you can't come up

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,720
with that you can't use to share there's

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,789
all kinds of mediums maybe Instagram is

00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,900
your thing there's people that are

00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:00,340
millionaires on there I don't know how

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,620
they're doing it but if you could figure

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,789
that out you wouldn't be here

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:11,200
listening to me right we'd all be off

00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:15,100
riding your Ferrari alright so we talked

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,260
about you I talked about sharing this is

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,140
where it leads to the growth I already

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,039
mentioned one one growth aspect here is

00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,570
you're going to get some recognition

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,070
around that you're an expert in the

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,090
topic whether you're an expert or not

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,070
that really doesn't matter that's a

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,230
relative term but you're somebody

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:35,930
willing to share these

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:37,430
for good or bad and anybody you're

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,910
helping to get further along in what

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:44,690
they're doing that's the growth you're a

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:47,870
teacher you let your kids run across the

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,250
street in traffic why do you let the

00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:53,150
developer sitting next to you to work do

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:55,550
the same thing all right it's it's it's

00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,050
a mindset it's just there shouldn't be

00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,660
this fear that if I help him he's gonna

00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,320
go past me you know the fastest way to

00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,940
promotion

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,250
let's make everybody look good around

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:12,560
you seems weird doesn't it it's worked

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:15,230
for me don't climb over people you lift

00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,420
them up it's a completely different

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,980
philosophy it's got nothing to do with

00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:22,250
socialism it's got nothing to do with

00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,700
communism all right it's not political

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,080
it's no need to be people that act like

00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,440
that they always get bitten you ask

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:36,890
eventually right I can sleep at night I

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:39,200
can look in the mirror so you've been

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,550
here for three days three days yeah I

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,840
assume you've been here three days you

00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:45,260
got three days you just come on

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,970
Saturdays that would be really hardcore

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,280
you blow off the weekend then just come

00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:52,700
in the weekend how many people live

00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:58,010
local to Boston who drove more than an

00:31:52,700 --> 00:32:00,510
hour who had to fly to get here Jesus

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:04,890
look at this very cool

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:06,930
that's dedication so think about it

00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,930
think about Sharon please please please

00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:12,870
please please I hope to read your

00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,100
one day to write maybe you help me

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,130
figure out how to change the oil in my

00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,130
car

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,480
third time you're seeing that that that

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:30,110
means you won't forget it ever you share

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:30,110
grow very simple very easy any questions

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:39,090
it's so shocking nobody has it stunned

00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:40,320
if anyone does have a question if you

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,340
want to raise your hand I'll get you to

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:49,260
think right here thank you alright I

00:32:44,340 --> 00:33:07,470
repeat his question while listening to

00:32:49,260 --> 00:33:10,140
you Mel filters and experience over time

00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,300
there's a lot of I don't read so

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,250
when I go on vacation I put a note up

00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,590
because I read this once it I think

00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,030
Volkswagen does this they automatically

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,560
put you're out of office to delete all

00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,150
email they think that the health of the

00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,590
employees important enough that you do

00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,880
not need to be coming back and Sunday

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,190
night trying to figure out what your big

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,300
pile of email is it's important

00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,260
everybody knows that in the company so

00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,450
if it's really important they'll get you

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,890
again so I put a really clear out of

00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:35,220
office message when I'm gone I'm gone

00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,870
I'm deleting everything and reach out

00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:41,540
when I get back this worked for the last

00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:45,120
two years mailing lists are filterable

00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:47,910
so my inbox is you're pretty select

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,230
person if you get into my inbox it's all

00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:51,930
that other crap can pile up and I can

00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:55,260
browse and when I got time but it's a

00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:57,269
it's a it's a technique it's an art form

00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,279
but still the source man keep doing and

00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:04,760
you're gonna keep doing it you know we

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:07,700
have we have a 1 1 1 internal legendary

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,750
artifact it's called the memo list

00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,389
anybody its Red Hatters giggling right

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,740
now right I you not and most people

00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,389
don't believe this I was on that thing

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,700
one hour you're automatically subscribed

00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,950
back when I joined there was just over

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,040
2,000 employees I was a 15th solution

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,540
architect in May that was already

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,339
off the rocker I mean like within the

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,829
first hour I think I had 500 emails in

00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:30,540
that thing and I'm not kidding it's the

00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:33,179
hardcore Linux

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,389
I'm sorry very deep like religious about

00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:38,220
stupid I mean it is unbelievable

00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:41,070
what they get pissed off about it's

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,349
embarrassing and there's no filter I

00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,639
mean actually this should be used to

00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:47,250
fight it figure out who you fire in the

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,740
company in my opinion but that's not how

00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:52,740
it works so my opinion is one small

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,260
opinion in all these people but I can

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,300
unsubscribe and I did I've never gone

00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,640
back and haven't missed anything we have

00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,890
in the JBoss side something called the

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,660
core which is the same idea but it's

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,240
like listening to the three-year-olds in

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,829
daycare versus the intellectuals all

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,690
right they do complain about stuff but

00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:12,210
it's based on things and it has you know

00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,460
discussions and stuff I can live with

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,069
and that's maybe 10 a month it's a big

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:22,079
difference big difference but the memo

00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:24,599
list oh my god yeah thanks for the dog

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,200
but I had a question regarding sharing

00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,640
stuff basically if you have something

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,770
radical or controversial to say about a

00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,359
topic what if the company that you're

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,880
working with doesn't write it doesn't

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,460
like what you're writing about or

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,930
somebody from somebody doesn't like what

00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,369
you have written in the past and they

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:45,900
come back to haunt you aren't you okay

00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:47,180
there's a couple things there one if

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,130
your company won't allow you that's

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,760
that's something you agreed to when you

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,760
signed up there

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:01,339
I am NOT a fan of anybody filtering my

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:03,230
stuff but that also requires discipline

00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:05,150
and maturity on your part to not write

00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,560
like a juvenile child and call people

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,910
names and you know what I'm talking

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,570
about

00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,619
consider every email when the best piece

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,089
of advice I ever got earlier in my

00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,740
career was consider each email each

00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,570
message you send in the company whatever

00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,000
as if it's gonna be on the front page of

00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:22,130
the New York Times you do that and

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,089
you'll be fine you won't be on memo list

00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:28,010
but he'll be fine that doesn't mean that

00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:30,050
everybody let's you working at the bank

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,940
was hard to do stuff like that when I

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:37,040
was writing they were pretty open about

00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:38,570
it but it's up to you what you want to

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,400
do with it I can't tell you to quit your

00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:43,010
job you know I'm saying that's that's

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,369
the easy way out for me personally it's

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:48,410
a hint I don't want to work here I've

00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:50,030
actually done job interviews where you

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,530
sit down and based on the feeling I'm

00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,550
getting and the questions I'm asking if

00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:55,190
you've been around a while you know what

00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:57,170
you like and when are we happiest at

00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,180
work when we go to work with a smile

00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,980
when we want to be there when things are

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,359
easy when I can do a little bit of what

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,310
I want to do and a lot of what they

00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:05,570
require me to do and the more we can

00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:08,480
turn it the other way around the better

00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:10,609
right if I like programming in Java I

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,859
don't want to do Perl if I have to do

00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:15,140
20% Perl and 80% job maybe I can live

00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:17,450
with that but if it's 64 - the other way

00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,410
around I probably want to leave so in

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,420
job interviews you start asking

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,270
questions or when people approach me for

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,410
stuff and I've actually twice stood up

00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:28,190
in the middle of one and said thanks for

00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:29,630
the coffee and left completely freaked

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,180
them out they don't like it when people

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,430
do that and I'm not being arrogant or

00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,250
not being an it's just we can

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,930
better stop now think about the process

00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,640
as you go through for a job if it's

00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:43,910
difficult already and you're not even in

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:47,210
imagine how messed up HR is already it's

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:49,040
just gonna get worse and if you think

00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,020
back for the experience guys that's

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,620
proven out more times than not when you

00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,860
get into these jobs

00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,420
so I don't mess with it anymore it's not

00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,740
worth it so I would say if it really

00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,340
makes you pissed off about that stuff

00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:04,230
then don't sometimes you can arrange

00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,540
that stuff that you write on your time

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:11,580
don't use their hardware then they have

00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:13,050
nothing to say about it right but I mean

00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,190
you're all young right I don't know how

00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,630
many of your parents now I've been

00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,060
putting you on Facebook since you were

00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,620
born you know there's people that are

00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,270
doing that there's stuff out there now

00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,690
about you that maybe you didn't put

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,220
there and you do have to own whatever

00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,740
you write and is on the internet forever

00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:31,200
and ever and ever and your bare butt on

00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,350
spring break hanging off a bar is gonna

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,060
follow you for a long time you know and

00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,300
writing really nasty stuff or making

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,500
comments like who hasn't seen people

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,210
getting in trouble for stuff they poke

00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,740
how many baseball players this last year

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,050
that when they were 16 in high school

00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,490
said some racist in Texas and are

00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,010
now being held accountable because me

00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:52,100
too is a big deal over here now god I

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,480
missed the all-star game because of it

00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,980
are you accountable can somebody use

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,330
common sense if I was hiring somebody

00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,500
like that I'd sit down and talk with

00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,760
them and I don't think they should be

00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,170
held accountable their whole life for

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,810
sixteen year old one statement on

00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,290
Twitter you know I'm saying but that's

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:08,510
me

00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,510
not all bosses are gonna be like that

00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:16,269
I can't warn you enough man think before

00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:17,710
you push publish but that being said I

00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:19,450
mean I have opinions on stuff and I've

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,710
published about them and yeah I own them

00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,140
that's what I think

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,670
I'm not abusive I'm not a shock jock and

00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,309
that's not me maybe that's you

00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,880
that could be your brand see where it

00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:30,059
takes you

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,640
I mean who's that guy in New York City

00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:35,710
the DJ Howard Stern or whatever he's

00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,749
like crazy out there right I mean but

00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:41,079
he's that's his thing he's doing just

00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:42,970
fine got more money I do probably never

00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,680
makes you happy and that's that's the

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,089
big key thing on this if you're sharing

00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,970
and you're helping people you're doing

00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:50,740
what you love has will open up and you

00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,990
get a choose between a and B pick one of

00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,569
the two and go don't look back he ain't

00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,160
going that way that answer your question

00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:59,160
and the really long roundabout way

00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:06,220
everybody's got an opinion anybody have

00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:12,809
an opinion on what he's asking here's

00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:12,809
your chance share anything else

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,200
it's all common sense really right I'm

00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,470
just sharing what I've gone through and

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:27,150
what I've you know seen up close on the

00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:27,950
lucky path I've been able to take do you

00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:31,440
like it

00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:33,029
pretty sure you guys did I've yet to

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,579
have an audience watch this one and like

00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:36,990
be bored it's really funny to watch your

00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,609
faces you should stand up here and see

00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,890
how the reactions are going it's really

00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:42,329
cool I mean there's enough talks I do

00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,200
where you're talking about technology

00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:45,390
and half the people who are in their

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,349
laptop and like that it's really

00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,329
nice when you see something you're

00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,130
touching a nerve on people that you know

00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:52,559
it's helping them get to some place they

00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:56,150
need to be I feel like this is pretty

00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,150
close this is one of my favorites to do

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,849
like it good any last minute comments

00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:06,180
we've got like two minutes probably yeah

00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:09,390
I have I that's another thing take this

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:14,190
please please take this never talks 45

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:17,880
minutes if your story is 30 take 30 okay

00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:21,779
now let me go if your talk is two hours

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,730
and you use 15 minutes let me go but you

00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,140
filled your story your audience is gonna

00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,849
be so much more happier than that you're

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,230
doing this crap and trying to look at

00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:31,230
your watch and stretch this out to

00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:33,630
45 minutes okay I almost never look at

00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,220
the Neph look at the clock I think my

00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,220
first talk today was about half hour

00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,960
maybe was supposed to be longer but I

00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,609
was done and it's based on what your

00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,140
reaction isn't what you guys are doing I

00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:48,170
can't turn this into a whole discussion

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,170
if you don't ask a question right see

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:55,080
oh yeah yeah the titles are kind of

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:57,450
funky yeah so my real title is

00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,390
consulting level technical marketing

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,770
which is complete mumbo-jumbo it's just

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,620
something that they use in the hierarchy

00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,690
in there so I use global technology

00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,430
evangelist most of the time but the last

00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,140
year and a half two years I've been

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:15,180
doing a role that's called portfolio

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:17,730
architect and what I do basically what

00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,530
I'm not doing this is kind of

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,940
interesting it's what the Solutions

00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,230
Architect the field don't have time to

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,930
do and we're consultants don't have time

00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,950
to do they do engagements and do really

00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,230
complicated solutions with our

00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,910
technologies for example omni-channel

00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,470
integration so integrating everything

00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,300
through their stack micro service and

00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,040
all the stuff so they can talk to their

00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,760
customers and all their channels that's

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,440
pretty pretty huge they'll have a big

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,270
repository document somewhere and then

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,100
they move on and the essays done the

00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:46,050
word those are and nobody can the line

00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,610
three of these customers to look at how

00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,470
they did this with our technology so

00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:57,060
that's what I do so I took three

00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:59,760
different ones a bank an airport and and

00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,880
I look at that and then turn that into a

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,650
generic architecture with diagrams based

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,420
on all three so it's not any specific

00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,580
one but it's generically how you do that

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,020
so then the solution architect can talk

00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,360
to a new person that's interested in

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,460
this area or pieces of that architecture

00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,940
and have a you know story around it to

00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,020
look at based on customers so it's not

00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,670
we like to say that there's a lot of

00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,260
marketing out there around products and

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,880
solutions where people talk about all

00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,100
the cool they can do this is

00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,930
fact-based nothing that appears in mind

00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,070
is marketing so it's really funny the

00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,570
reactions internally is all the

00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,040
marketing people are like no no it does

00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,550
this it does that my practice no it

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,870
doesn't this is what your product does

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,350
you want to market something else that's

00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:43,200
fine with me

00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:44,700
so that's what I do Eric do you really

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,710
have another talking like seven minutes

00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,000

00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,400

stuff in one day so thank you so if you

all want to run over to the other thing

00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:58,920
on the other side here that thing there

00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,690
we can do some fun stuff on stage and

00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,750
oxide code something for you yeah that's

00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:07,770
the conference auditorium yeah
