Title: Non-developers can contribute open source too!
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Ashton Davis

Open source communities are no different from any other software development project - there are roles and niches for everyone, not just software developers. I spent many years embedded within and contributing to open source projects without really submitting any code at all. If that's what's holding you back from getting involved, then this is the session for you!

By the end of this session you should have some ideas for how to get involved - my desire is to help us non-developer types be as involved as our developer counterparts -- we're absolutely still needed!
