Title: Non-developers can contribute open source too!
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Ashton Davis

Open source communities are no different from any other software development project - there are roles and niches for everyone, not just software developers. I spent many years embedded within and contributing to open source projects without really submitting any code at all. If that's what's holding you back from getting involved, then this is the session for you!

By the end of this session you should have some ideas for how to get involved - my desire is to help us non-developer types be as involved as our developer counterparts -- we're absolutely still needed!

	00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,070
yeah can everybody hear me can anybody

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,650
not hear me I've never got never had

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,800
anybody tell me they couldn't hear me

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,300
so hey welcome this son this is a talk

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,450
that I have been wanting to give her a

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,120
long time so I'll do a bit of history on

00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,700
myself here but the main idea behind

00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,219
this is the open source communities and

00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,960
projects I feel like a lot of how we

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,610
talk about them a lot of the conferences

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,590
given the name of this is literally open

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,840
source developers conference is kind of

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,940
aimed more at developers even though a

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,000
lot of us who are not developers either

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,610
for a living or by passion actually are

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,489
in open source communities don't

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,220
necessarily always feel like there's a

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,079
lot as much aimed at us and so I was

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,160
going to talk a bit through this so but

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,260
more than likely if you hear you're not

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,059
a developer right yeah there's like

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,399
dozens of us dozens I'd like to get an

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,280
idea of however who I have in the room

00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,659
and what sort of what your role is so

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,770
it's not too many people I think I

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,159
probably even just get every one of you

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,399
but there's like system admin system

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,590
engineer for a living there you go okay

00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:21,590
for the rest of you what do you do oh

00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:28,340
marketing okay yeah how much you in the

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,340
back what what is your role in

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,780
you're a developer okay whose develop or

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,600
developers all right there we go all

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,160
right fine okay well it's good it's

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,330
always good to have a good diverse crowd

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,200
so um this is kind of the overview right

00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:50,840
so I'll give you a bit of background on

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,690
me why this is a talk that I care about

00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,220
Who I am and you know who is this guy up

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,650
at the front of the room talking and

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,810
then I've got three main points we'll

00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,369
talk about what the big idea is what

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,640
what I actually am trying to get across

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,979
how you can get involved and why it's

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,739
important that everybody is involved in

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:14,750
open-source so I am a red Hatter so I

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,989
worked for Red Hat I just passed three

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,480
years this July and I am what was called

00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:23,480
a Solutions Architect so my job is to

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,700
work with Red Hat's customers to solve

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,880
their business challenges or business

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,520
initiatives or project requirements with

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,390
open source solutions those come from us

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,510
and my background prior to working at

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,130
Red Hat was in I was behind a desk as a

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,830
systems engineer I did automation

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,390
largely and I worked with open source

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,610
technology and I was an open source

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:51,260
contributor also I'm a gamer that's my

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,880
actual minecraft avatar is link 30

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,310
favorite games and all of all time

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,890
probably Legend of Zelda franchise and

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,920
and minecraft and all of its 32,000

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:03,160
iterations and that's my cat he's very

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,100
nice he lets me live in his house

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,380
sometimes if I'm very good he snuggles

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,060
me but he's very soft and cuddly and

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,540
that's what keeps me sane while I'm

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:18,350
working um in open-source is where I got

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,880
my start largely I can trace my roots in

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,920
open-source all the way back to the day

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,299
I remember learning about it everyone

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,060
familiar with Drupal anybody not

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:29,540
familiar with Drupal yeah and so Drupal

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,670
is this open source CMS and it was all

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,549
the rage back in the day when CMS's were

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,680
beginning to really come to fruition as

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,110
you know what open source versions of

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,239
them were properly coming into their own

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,359
and we had Drupal and a whole bunch of

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,350
others WordPress strangely transforming

00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,720
from a blog platform

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,060
to the CMS and I went to DrupalCon and

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,960
at DrupalCon this lady named web check

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,720
who is still the Drupal community

00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,490
manager gave this what I call a sermon I

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,860
think she probably appreciate that this

00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,120
sermon about open source and what it

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,680
meant for Drupal and what it meant for

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,060
the community and why we should get

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,790
involved and that was the day that it

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,950
sparked in me what open source was and I

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,020
decided I wanted to be closer to it in

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,520
my career so when I left working for the

00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,340
university I went to working in the

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,920
private sector and was plunged into a

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,930
world of unsupported open-source

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,430
technology and no one I worked for up

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,320
until read had ever wanted to buy

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,120
software they always wanted to use the

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,020
quote unquote free open-source version

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,100
so I became very plugged into and active

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,160
in the communities these are the

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,510
communities that contributed to the most

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,220
there's a few others that are in there

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,990
actually pulp I've even had some

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,540
interaction with that community through

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,830
my work with the foremen but this is

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,740
where I've come from this is my

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,680
background and I just wanted to give an

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,080
idea of the reach that I've been able to

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,150
have even in the only five or six years

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,120
I was really properly active before I

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:56,390
went into working at Red Hat this is

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,060
where I've come from so so I want to

00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,500
talk a bit about why I have brought this

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,840
topic to you in the first place and what

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,750
it's all about so the big idea is that

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,710
open source is not just for developers

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,480
developers are extremely important

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,930
developers are the base of everything

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,280
that we do but software projects are

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,190
software projects so there's this great

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,380
quote from lenez Torvalds long may he

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,820
reign that is in open source we feel

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,280
strongly but to do something well you

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,780
have to get a lot of people involved he

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,110
didn't just say developers you said

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,630
people and he knows if of anybody that

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,260
there are roles within every software

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:37,400
projects that require more than just

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,050
development skill and so software the

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,760
first point is two points here right but

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,860
there's the first point in this software

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,210
projects are the open source projects

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,200
are just software projects they're no

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,080
different from any other software

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,250
project they're needy software projects

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,050
have a lot of needs so just to give a

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,080
quick snapshot of the kinds of non

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,060
development roles we deal with product

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,860
and project managers right the chief

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,410
herder of the team people that keep

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,820
things on track people that decide

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,150
priorities and what has to be done here

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,150
and there QA & QE because nobody writes

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,310
bug-free code people that specialize not

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,960
only in how to make something pretty but

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,190
also how to make it functional I was

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,230
just talking to somebody else that's out

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,360
there who works for our user experience

00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,060
team whose background is psychology and

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,160
is the one that's out there started he's

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,139
the one that's got the strings going up

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,419
to sort of what you do and how much you

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,889
work with this and that he's out there

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,110
doing research on user experience that's

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,410
incredibly important and that's not

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,910
something that without a background in

00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,010
that and without that being your passion

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,620
and your specialty is a skill that is

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,410
necessary for this marketing right we

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,090
have to get the word out somehow build

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,680
engineers and technical writers these

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,250
are like the what I thought of sort of

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,340
the six most common overarching roles

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,530
and and niches that get filled with any

00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,510
within any given software project this

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,400
is sort of more enterprise level right

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,169
what you would do at work not

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,110
necessarily in the open source we'll get

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,880
to that in a bit but also open source

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,340
projects or communities there's this

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,229
wonderful set of stickers here from the

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,490
fedora community and I love what the

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,630
assess is the very top of the I just got

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,400
these this morning it's just the best

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,660
communities are inclusive and diverse I

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,000
love that because it's completely true

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,930
mahajan is communities are not as rich

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,970
or functional even as a diverse

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:34,850
community and so to give you an idea

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,410
these three projects are some of the

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,770
healthiest and most diverse communities

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,660
I've ever seen and I don't show these

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,360
logos because they are enterprise

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,150
products I think actually the fact that

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,760
they're Enterprise oops

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:53,120
I guess I'm sorry I forgot to plug it in

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,800
it's my fault it's good um so what we

00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,650
get from this is what we get from a

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,970
diverse community piece I guess I don't

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,650
know if caffeine is stole any more okay

00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,650
well fine I'll just shake my mouse once

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,909
in a while so these are examples of what

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,979
you get from the healthy community right

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:13,100
and the fact that their communities were

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:17,150
healthy and what they produced was straw

00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:20,060
what they produced was good what they've

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,940
produced has been very useful ansible in

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,400
particular ansible is a fantastic

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,180
example of a community that is perfectly

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,300
married the skills of developers to the

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,940
needs of the systems engineering side of

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,550
the world right danceable is my favorite

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,060
product that I work with sales teams to

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:44,330
sell I just got back from talking to a

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,120
customer about how we can transform

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,590
everything that they do using by

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,540
changing a bit of their culture to

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,610
properly take advantage of automation

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,980
and to utilize ansible and that's going

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,510
to solve all of these challenges that

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,610
their development world had solved a

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,380
long time ago with CI CD tools and build

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,470
tools but the automation we needed to

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,060
properly develop and program the systems

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,040
side of the house has been lacking until

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,600
we had a tool like this and it was

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,630
possible because it was a big effort

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,940
from developers who saw that need and

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,950
system engineers and everybody else in

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,140
between taking part and feeding back

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,330
into it and contributing and ansible now

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,460
is literally taking over the world it's

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,440
amazing so this is what you get when you

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,760
have these diverse communities elastic

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,710
is another really good example of that I

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,720
was involved early on with the

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,190
elasticsearch project now it's an

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,560
incredible company some of my friends

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,560
work there and and they've built

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,480
something great and they still still

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,800
foster and take care of their community

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,680
um what you get what do you potentially

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,390
get when you have a somewhat homogeneous

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,250
community something that nobody loves

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,290
great nobody loves PHP nobody loves to

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,580
work with PHP it's awful it's terrible

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,920
even if you contribute to it it's

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,330
terrible I have to admit I tried to get

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,690
involved in that community it didn't

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,460
want me they're not very interested in

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,170
ideas they're not terribly into why this

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,210
is my experience but four or five years

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,860
ago but I think that's a good example of

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,380
the fact that it's like yeah it's there

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,540
because I don't know no one's really

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,760
replaced it yet but and nobody loves

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,490
this anymore nobody leaps out of bed for

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,830
PHP in the way that we do for NGO or for

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,460
even Ruby or something like that so um

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:26,740
to make this point sort of open-source

00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:29,019
needs you if you're not involved yet

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,920
open-source has a place for you these

00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:34,959
projects have a place for you so how

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
might I get involved you might be asking

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,380
I'm glad you asked

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,120
they've got some ideas so let's go back

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,440
to this now I've kind of modified this

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,880
list looks familiar right it looks a bit

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,180
like the one I showed a few minutes ago

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,130
so this list I've changed the titles a

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,279
little bit to match more of the

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,560
functional role that that sort of niche

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,449
would look like in a community but where

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,800
we might have a product or project

00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:58,720
manager oftentimes we have Community

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,730
Managers Community Managers are

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,430
sometimes function as product managers

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,560
sometimes we have product managers and

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,050
they often also act as project managers

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,639
so these are people that help centralize

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,709
the efforts in the community that help

00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,310
keep projects on track that help decide

00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:21,089
on priorities often that interacts

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,990
constantly with the communities

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,300
beneficiaries so the people that are out

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,370
there using the software that may not be

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,110
plugged into the community they read the

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,690
feedback emails things like this very

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,699
important role absolute glue for

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,740
everything that happens QA and testing

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:37,420
there is no QA department for open

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,470
source projects right the community is

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,720
QA and what is expected of us as

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,810
community members is that we try and

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,870
work with new versions of things and

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,029
push them and use them to their proper

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,560
use and when they don't work because it

00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,269
is a win because it's software there's

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,089
no such thing as perfect software when

00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,470
they don't work we report it and we make

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,569
sure that that is known to the community

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,930
and we can help and work with the people

00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:08,019
that are developing it if we're not the

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,510
developer to fix those issues you buy an

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:12,490
UX designer right just as important it's

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,920
software that is going to be used needs

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,389
to be software that is functional also

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,250
the same thing software that is used

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:20,560
must be able to be used so if we don't

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,670
have documentation so the greatest

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,170
software in the world is kind of useless

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,540
if you have absolutely no idea how to

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,399
even install it and use it marketing is

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,589
still important to build and release

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,529
it's very important and I'm going to

00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,880
dive into a few of these so the first

00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:39,130
one is say one of the places that in my

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,220
time being involved in open source I

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,590
made some

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,910
the largest impact was just writing

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,490
documentation that was it

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,170
it's like hey um I kind of figured out

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,720
this process can you check that I do

00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,460
this right they're like yeah yeah that

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,500
seems right and they cool like no one's

00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,750
written this down yet and they were like

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,360
yeah well I look forward to your

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,280
contribution which is one of my favorite

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,020
responses in the open-source world

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,670
people get complaining they don't really

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,780
have something to offer you say okay

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,450
I'll look forward to your contribution

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,880
but in reality I got the point

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,790
so I wrote it up and I submitted it this

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,440
is I took this picture actually is

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,570
markdown and it comes out of the

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,190
Foreman's documentation it's not one I

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,050
tried to look for maybe some Docs that I

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,480
wrote back in the day I I couldn't find

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,640
the exact section but it's easy like

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,750
it's so easy to take the notes you

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,460
probably already have written on how

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,640
you're doing something convert them into

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,260
documentation format send in a PR more

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,880
than likely they're just gonna say oh my

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,040
gosh thank goodness somebody finally

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,390
actually committed something yes we'll

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,700
take it we'll put this in place right

00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,470
but it's so important to have all these

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,940
things documented and we want to make

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:49,600
sure that the software that we're

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:53,750
writing has a good documented source of

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,300
instruction and how to an FAQ even going

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,460
so far as just collecting frequently

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,160
asked questions out of an IRC Channel

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,060
and forums and mailing lists and

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,740
maintaining that list of frequently

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,740
asked questions and their answers is

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,480
incredibly beneficial because a lot of

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,700
us search for something like that before

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,830
we try to even send an email is there an

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,890
FAQ is there a QuickStart guide a quick

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,300
reference on how about an upgrade guide

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,370
right that's another thing that's really

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,370
really really useful that we don't get

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,910
very often if we're gonna go from

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,470
version 1.9 to 2.0 of a project there's

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,150
probably a fair bit of work that you

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,010
would have to do to actually upgrade and

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,110
any of us that figured it out have some

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,820
notes on it it doesn't take too long to

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,350
convert that into markdown or whatever

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,930
format the project wants to use and

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,360
submit it and you would benefit so many

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,870
people I I was so surprised when people

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,610
saw that I committed something they were

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,900
like oh thank you like we've wanted that

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,839
for so long it's none of us have had the

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,040
time and I'm not a doctor and I you know

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,550
spellcheck doesn't work because I'm so

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,750
bad those

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,580
things are the kinds of things that we

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,320
can really do it and especially those of

00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,700
us on the system side of the house all

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,200
of us should have a background and

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,800
documenting that's like half of our job

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,399
sometimes

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,260
so I'm also testing and reporting and I

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,410
would emphasize the word reporting it's

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,420
great to try open-source software

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,420
I'm trying some right now actually this

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,339
is a presentation remote that I'm so

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,200
that I can see my speaker notes I found

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,610
it there was one I used to use that I

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,500
hadn't used in a while so it uninstalled

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,850
it I went back to look and there's a new

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,470
one in there that's open-source and I go

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,550
this is cool so hey if it breaks it

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,050
breaks I'm gonna let them know what

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,839
broke and what didn't work but that's

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,190
what's important - sometimes the one of

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,040
the biggest contributions you can make

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,769
and SSST was up there on my list of

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,350
projects my only contribution to SSST

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:42,360
was months and months of it didn't work

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,630
this is why here my logs let's look into

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,529
it and my contributions for that was

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,660
very helpful in finalizing the

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:54,779
integration into don't know what SSD is

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,180
it's the from in Red Hat based operating

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:59,130
systems it is the sort of daemon that

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,950
handles authentication on the system so

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,630
when you connect to LDAP server or to

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,520
Active Directory or to something else

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,589
it's what handles the connection it's

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,390
what does the user translation leakin

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,610
set all sorts of permission controls and

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,890
stuff it was great and I was working

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,020
with it in the upstream because

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,270
unfortunately again I said my company

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,880
didn't want to pay for support so I had

00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,950
to live in the SST channel on freenode

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,450
and I got to know a lot of the core

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,640
developers and some of them are still my

00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,040
very good friends and in fact one of

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,829
them in particular was sort of like

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,230
heads up quality engineering for SSD at

00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:35,459
Red Hat and I was in the community

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,990
running into all sorts of problems

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,579
because I was trying to integrate with

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,579
Active Directory back when it was a very

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:44,010
new concept to do Linux as a native

00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:47,100
member in Active Directory I submitted

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,810
all this never code not once but I would

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,790
submit all sorts of issues that I ran

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,140
into and then we would resolve them and

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,399
I would try AHA fixes and they were good

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,140
and then those fixes would go into the

00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,970
community but I was opening I open

00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,040
probably 40 or 50 bugs in the course of

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,480
a few years including one that was a

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,060
race condition that it took us two years

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,610
to find and that was a huge contribution

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,140
because that's the kind of stuff that

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,000
you can't just get out of

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,860
rushon test even if you have a great

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,150
quality engineering team you still need

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,820
people reporting when they've run into

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,410
problems and working to resolve them and

00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,670
that is a really big contribution that

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,140
even at the time when I was so

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,690
frustrated and all I just wanted was to

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,730
get it fixed in retrospect I see how

00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,930
important that was to the project even

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,010
though I didn't necessarily think about

00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:30,270
it at the time that way um also

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,530
improving the experiences is really

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,870
important so and this is another

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,440
reporting thing right say it's not not

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,510
working

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,880
it just isn't great I don't like that

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,020
this button is here I keep miss clicking

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,450
and canceling something because the

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,920
button is there report that like that's

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,110
a big deal because it's not hard to move

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,300
a button and if you're frustrated more

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,770
than likely most people are too great I

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,960
mean how often if you encountered like a

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,310
prompt comes up and instead of okay

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,810
being on the right that's the cancel

00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,250
button and just instinctively you

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,680
accidentally cancel it you're like I

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,420
just lost 30 minutes of form that I

00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,950
filled out right well that's a user

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,040
experience problem something that we can

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,860
either submit a pretty quick fix for if

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,340
you're good with HTML or CSS or any of

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,230
the simple web rendering code or send in

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,720
a report and talk about it if you happen

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,400
to specialize in user experience that

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,070
would be incredible to get involved in

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,540
the community and say hey let me work on

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,680
this let's put on some surveys see how

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,790
people feel about this let me look

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,800
through the bug reports and the things

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,960
that people have feedback that kind of

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,640
contribution can be just as useful even

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,950
if it's just bringing expertise and

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,510
saying these are the kinds of changes we

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,690
could make that would make this easier

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,270
or better to use in long run on I would

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,610
also say the other contribution that I

00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:44,700
was surprised to find out was so

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:48,150
important was the help the people so I

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,740
would just be in chat rooms right it's

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,020
kind of further to a point I'm gonna

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,510
make in a bit I would be in the chat

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,790
rooms I would asked for help and I would

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,560
get help or I'd figure something out

00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,790
then when people started coming in and

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,710
they were asking the same questions I

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,420
was asking I was answering them because

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,400
the people that were answering me were

00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,500
busy their core maintainer of the

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,610
project their developers they've got

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,990
their code to write they've got their

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,030
day jobs and they're just on this

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,950
channel well I was at my day job

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,170
my company wasn't going to pay for this

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,520
software and so I thought the least they

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,500
could do is let me be involved in the

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,059
community as part of it because if they

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,009
say we we pay for engineer

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:26,039
to note for software that's not an

00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:27,570
invalid point and I absolutely used

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,610
their engineering dollars on maintaining

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,259
this projects right I would sit in this

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,120
channel and answer questions and talk to

00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,190
people and just be involved in this much

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,889
to my surprise one day one of the

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,210
community managers for elastic send me a

00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,590
private message and asked me for my

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,919
address and like why did I do something

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,299
wrong

00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,860
she's like no we wanted to send you a

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,389
thank-you gift just like sure what did I

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,330
win some raffle I didn't know about

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:49,740
she's like no you're like everybody here

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,940
knows your handle everybody knows who

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,960
you are because you're the most helpful

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,059
person in the channel and is like really

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,980
I feel like all I do sit around and talk

00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,710
to people she's like yeah we need that

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,720
it's really important and and so from

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,070
that day forward I redoubled my efforts

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,539
any time someone came in and asked for

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,149
help I tried to help troubleshoot I

00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,769
would ask the basic questions cuz to be

00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:09,779
honest with you if it's not somebody

00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:12,749
friendly more than likely you're gonna

00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,490
get somebody gruff who's like up at 2:00

00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:16,350
in the morning and they're like are you

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,179
kidding me why don't you read this if we

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,740
manual and you're like the amount of

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,899
that answer an open source is

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,570
infuriatingly common and it's because

00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,529
people aren't there who want to help who

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,450
want to be able to answer these

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,860
questions and so the people that don't

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,909
want to answer them are left to do it

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,960
and what kind of answer are you gonna

00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:32,879
get into something that doesn't want to

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,619
be somebody that doesn't want to be

00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:37,169
doing this and it's like I don't know

00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:41,429
it's just it's not the best experience

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:44,639
and um I I walked away from communities

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:46,710
over that I walked away from names but

00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:48,869
uh I will I walked away from the Ruby

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,039
community over that because I wanted to

00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:51,389
be involved in the Ruby community and I

00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,789
had an issue and I brought it forward to

00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:56,340
them and they literally with multiple

00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:57,840
expletives told me to get lost and I was

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,149
like okay well this isn't the community

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,470
I want to be part of if you're part of a

00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:03,629
community and you want other people to

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,639
be part of it be part of it with them

00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:09,929
which brings me I think to my next point

00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:11,460
which is getting the word out another

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,590
thing that's very very helpful in a huge

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,299
contribution to open source is bringing

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,490
in contributors and bringing in

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:21,059
community members and one way we can do

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:24,119
this is by advertising any time in any

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,320
way we can so when we say get the word

00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,759
out this means that we're at a

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,830
conference like this and you're in a

00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,210
conversation with somebody and they say

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,470
yeah I'm working on this thing or that

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,240
thing have you heard of this project

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,500
it's really neat there's this really

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,150
great way to handle this

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,640
particular issue maybe it's something

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,110
small a small open source library maybe

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,120
it's something huge like the foreman

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,650
which I was constantly evangelizing

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,360
because I was it changed my job but I

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,760
was absolutely in love with it they like

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,880
your hat over there mister the foreman

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,230
hat the bright yellow one I love those a

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,610
foreman is probably my favorite project

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,070
because of what it did for me I will

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,240
always love that project and I still

00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,740
good friends with a lot of the

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,570
maintainer zin the community manager

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,340
even though it's not my job anymore I

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,070
don't have the time I'm still plugged

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,250
into that community and getting the word

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,410
out is something I still do I think this

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,690
is where I make this point either way so

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,580
I'm one thing that's really really great

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,650
and that we often really need people for

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,180
is working booths at conferences if you

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,090
go to a conference like scale within

00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,980
Southern California Linux Expo is my

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,900
favorite conference of all time because

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,310
it's just like completely organized by

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,860
communities that's it there is no

00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:34,110
corporate sponsor I mean this is an

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,520
awesome conference but it's it's put on

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,800
by Red Hat it's our conference right

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,360
there's no red hat behind scale scale is

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,730
entirely a community conference and

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,980
every single booth there is some kind of

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,590
open source project and somebody had to

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,630
show up and talk to people and bring

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,370
materials and be there at that

00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,020
conference and every time that

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,390
conference happens the amount of people

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,440
in that community grows because people

00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,240
are walking around that conference

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,100
looking for communities to be part of

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,370
and the same thing here we have

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,570
communities out there in that room and

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,890
there are people that are sitting there

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,050
who are there representing that

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,180
community that's a big contribution it's

00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,560
an investment in time for some of us it

00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,150
may be uncomfortable not everybody is a

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,370
people person but it is an awesome

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,760
experience to get to meet people to get

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,350
to talk so you get feedback on things so

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,620
I would say this is another very

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,570
important one and then the the final is

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,300
I think the final one is just join the

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,790
party like just go sit in the IRC

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,950
channel and have fun all of these all of

00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:33,300
these projects if they have more than 20

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,660
or 30 people in them probably have

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,730
talked 24/7 in their channel weekend's

00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,080
included which is astounding to me but

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,240
look at the scroll back and see this

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,350
lake deeply intelligent political

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,720
discussion that happened at 2:00 in the

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,000
morning on Sunday I like that kind of

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,580
thing was always amazing to me it

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,680
the party this is a picture of a meetup

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,570
that I threw together when I first

00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,400
started at Red Hat they needed somebody

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,080
to go to puppet conch and I was like

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,630
yeah I live in San Diego I'd be happy to

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,160
go to puppet conf and I realized oh hey

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,900
there's gonna be like a lot of people

00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,270
from the Forman project there because

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,160
the Forman project uses puppet so I

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,140
decided I would throw a meet-up and

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,490
Ollie does put out an invite and we

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,600
handed it out on the floor we got like

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,760
30 people

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,860
I was so unprepared for that I told the

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,420
restaurant 15 thank goodness they had a

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,060
long enough table but it was insane

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,590
people showed up and it was fun when

00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,690
they knew each other like oh my god

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,070
you're this person and they had so much

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,560
fun meeting each other over this table

00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:31,080
so not only do I recommend getting

00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,180
involved in contributing but just being

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,100
part of the community the community is

00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,780
so much fun and going in there and

00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,820
making friends and getting to meet them

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,710
at conferences because conferences are

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,060
probably the one time if you live on one

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,830
side of the country and they live on the

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,270
other the one time you're gonna meet

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,560
unless you become really good friends

00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,330
and fly somewhere to meet each other is

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,860
that a conference but that's what's

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,290
super fun about things like birds of a

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,480
feather or meetups that happen at

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:57,540
conferences those are your opportunities

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,920
to go and actually meet and physically

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,080
interact with these people that you

00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,110
spend so much time with online and it's

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,880
great it is so much fun um so the last

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,890
contribution you can make is just you

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,540
yourself and your personality and being

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,150
part of it and enriching the culture

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,190
within the community and becoming just

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,380
unknown members somebody who has yet

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,970
another friend in this group of friends

00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,720
who is trying to make something cool

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:24,240
happen so like I said there's a lot of

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,550
places you can a lot of niches to fill

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,520
everybody can be involved to some degree

00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:34,170
or another even if as I said it's just

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:37,580
answering just about them even if it's

00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:41,640
just answering questions for people so

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,830
and then I'd like to also talk a bit

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,970
about why and the reason I like to talk

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,280
about why is because they think a lot of

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:50,250
us know how important contribution is

00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,470
but it's a lot of work it's hard and I'd

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,620
like to give you some reasons to really

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:58,140
consider putting in the effort to get

00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,120
involved and get plugged in so first of

00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,180
all it's good for the community for a

00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,640
few reasons I

00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,620
a few already communities are healthiest

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,960
when they're diverse every new person

00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,570
joining is a new addition to diversity

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,060
every new person joining from some for

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,940
some niche skill that is needed is the

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:19,630
massive boost to diversity diversity of

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,660
opinion diversity of ideas diversity and

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,130
discussion diversity and contribution

00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,300
all of that is extremely important you

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,190
know what else is really important

00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,870
communities live and die by their

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,160
contributors and their members and if we

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,200
don't have enough people in a community

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,120
the communities burn out and they can

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,710
disappear and if there's a project that

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,430
we use and we love and we want to be

00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,620
part of the least we can do in across

00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,660
the board is be there to try to help

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,090
keep it going it's not free software

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,430
open-source is not free software it is

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:51,250
freely available but it is built on the

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:54,340
hard work and the backs of volunteers

00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,110
who have put their life effort and work

00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,480
into this now a lot of us were

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,400
maintaining open source projects as part

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,920
of our day job but it's still a lot of

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,170
work we weren't necessarily paid to

00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,180
maintain them we maintain them because

00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,040
they're important for what we do it is

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,470
still work over the top of what we do

00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,880
and if we want to have longevity in our

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,780
projects it's important that we're part

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,930
of them also it's very important for the

00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:22,630
community to have our input we need more

00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,700
than more than a small sample set in

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,360
order to get truly good feedback and to

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,440
make something better and also it's good

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,030
for the world I know it sounds like a

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,380
silly point but it actually is open

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,870
sources taken over the world like Red

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,310
Hat just got acquired by IBM and I don't

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,840
know if I don't know how many waves that

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,820
makes outside of people that really pay

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,150
attention to this iBM has ruled

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:45,220
technology for 105 years or something

00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,260
like that all right like IBM is why we

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,910
got to the moon it was IBM

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,560
supercomputers that were got installed

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,480
at NASA that did a bunch of calculations

00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,970
IBM has ruled the world on their

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,790
proprietary software and they crumbled

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:00,730
under the weight of the importance of

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,620
open source because open source came up

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,980
out of nowhere for some of these people

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,210
kicked them out of the data center and

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,670
absolutely rocked their world because

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,520
IBM could just sit there all day long

00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:14,830
and say we will make software for you

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,070
and you will like how we make it and it

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,659
will

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,250
be the right way it will be the software

00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,779
that you need it was always you we were

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,730
being told by proprietary software

00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:23,679
vendors this is what you want this is

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,419
what you need and at some point we got

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,460
freedom of access to the ability to

00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,590
write and share our own software and we

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,299
were like you guys are so wrong look how

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,220
much faster we can move with this look

00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,990
how many more contributors iBM has

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,610
hundreds of thousands of employees right

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,159
there are millions of contributors to

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:41,470
open source software we open source in

00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,360
general we so far outnumber proprietary

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,159
software it's not even funny because a

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,600
lot of people that work at IBM are also

00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:50,019
contributing and working on open source

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,169
projects the Venn diagram is huge and an

00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:55,419
open source makes all of this pale in

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,159
comparison and it's great we have so

00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:58,870
much great stuff now our jobs are so

00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,909
much better because of the open source

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,220
technologies that have transformed and

00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:05,470
enabled them there was no proprietary

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,720
puppet there was no proprietary the

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,730
foreman these things that were out there

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,779
were terrible the reason that nobody use

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,309
them is they were bad and they were

00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,470
expensive and nobody wanted to bother

00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,940
with the investment but we can put our

00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,509
time and effort into these things and

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:22,149
start to really change the world so but

00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:24,009
again that requires us being involved

00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:27,129
that requires us stepping out and

00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:29,830
actually plugging in to one or more

00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:32,710
communities and being part of the the

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:35,500
greater picture but frankly it's it's

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,500
never been easier ever for a small

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,879
contribution to make such a big impact I

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,340
was very proud to say that my small

00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:44,080
contributions were in my in the

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,370
documentation you know in the form and

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,220
for example we reviewed thousands of

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,740
times the small instruction set that I

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,659
maintained and kept updating every you

00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,190
know every update to the foreman

00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,720
codebase the instructions were a little

00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,179
bit different it was a really important

00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,799
set of instructions for people to have

00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,230
that was a small contribution on my part

00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,000
in general that was greatly beneficial

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,070
to a lot of people so I think this is

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,559
very important and then finally it's

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:12,070
good for you so a few reasons first of

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,200
all who here works with open source

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,940
upstream technology because as my

00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,980
company said we pay for engineers not

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,080
software I'm curious like any of you

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,639
working on unsupported running your

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,519
companies on unsupported open source

00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:25,779
software at least one I actually kind of

00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,549
expected that yeah as I say there's got

00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:28,780
to be at least a few of you right the

00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,490
thing that I found

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,130
was problematic about that is when

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,390
people said open-source is free I'd say

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,190
well it's not free I got to put in the

00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,630
work for it and then I would go and ask

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,010
for help in the community and they would

00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,180
always say if you want help you should

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,950
buy support because in a lot of these

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,690
communities they would support what I

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,040
found was the way that I got supporting

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,350
those communities was by being part of

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,020
it and if I was a part of it and they

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:52,500
knew who I was because I was an active

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,790
and contributing member I wasn't some

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,320
nobody off the street coming in and

00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,480
saying I don't have support but will you

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,620
help me I was someone who was in the

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
community and said I don't know how to

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,860
do this is someone available to help me

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,360
with this and everyone would be like

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,500
yeah sure give me 15 minutes and I'll

00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,440
spend some time with you on it

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,940
great there's a big difference in how we

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,590
work within a community how we're able

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,960
to access the resources within that

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,180
community when we are within the

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,250
community not just somebody showing up

00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,540
saying I've used this project for the

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,400
last five years and they're like great

00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:25,300
weird this is the first time we've seen

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,770
you welcome how can we help you and then

00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,620
us this really complicated support

00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,700
question and they're like look we're

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,800
volunteers we don't really have the time

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,510
for this I know it sounds silly but

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,300
being involved is actually how you

00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,740
access the support of the community by

00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,750
building a base of support for yourself

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,850
there's this quote I'm so dumb for

00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,010
closing the tab I was this quote that I

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,260
really liked I'm gonna try to paraphrase

00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,490
it but basically the it's a psychologist

00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,530
that says that there are sociologists

00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,570
that there are two kinds of communities

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,100
and I don't remember the names are some

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:57,100
complicated basically there's one kind

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,230
where you draw attention to yourself by

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,550
show of dominance and there's another

00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,490
kind where you draw attention to

00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,840
yourself by it sort of being part and

00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,670
open-source communities are the latter

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,960
you don't show up and show dominance

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,580
that doesn't work unless you're Linda's

00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,750
tour goals and even he got kicked out of

00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,040
his own community by the way if you

00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,450
didn't know that he was forcefully

00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,490
retired out of the community to cool off

00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,810
right you don't do that in open-source

00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,790
you can't be a tyrant

00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,610
everyone's a volunteer no one Falls tire

00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:24,040
interfere volunteer you get attention to

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,120
yourself by being part and by drawing

00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,180
attention to yourself in your

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,510
contributions um also as I said like I

00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,770
have friends here Jen who organizes this

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,190
conference and is one of the best people

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,960
in the world is my friend because I was

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,490
connected well enough within open-source

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,470
communities to want to go to scale and

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,059
scale is where I met Jen and I want

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,690
to go and be involved in Jen runs these

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:48,950
a lot of our open source upstream

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,960
community conferences

00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,700
I don't even though I worked for Red Hat

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,500
corporate I do not like corporate events

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,570
I don't want to go to reinvent I don't

00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,340
want to go to ignite I want to go to

00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,390
scale I want to come to Def Con I like

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,419
working with the people in the

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,760
communities this is fun like this has

00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:05,990
made my job what it is that I've had

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,340
this experience that I had these

00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,620
connections at Red Hat through my

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,970
community involvement also I have

00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,309
friends all around the world like

00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,409
everywhere I go if I go to some random

00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:17,510
foreign country I probably have a friend

00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:20,000
there someone who I have worked with for

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,409
years and I know and I would never have

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,630
known had it not been for my involvement

00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:27,980
in an open source community um and then

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:30,080
also like she is a really good way to

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,270
hone your skills you want to practice

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,549
something if you do want to sort of dip

00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,169
a toe into development you know is

00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:38,270
really happy to help you learn how to do

00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:40,490
something the people that might benefit

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,230
from your contribution to it so if

00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,820
you're in that community and you're part

00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,150
of that community and you go to one of

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,919
the developers and you're like hey um

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,990
kind of want to learn how to write a bit

00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,520
more Python you know I want to do some

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,780
of this object-oriented stuff and get

00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,820
really into more of the programming side

00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,250
of the house I was thinking there's this

00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,929
backlog item I might work on would you

00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,179
mind helping me with that and they

00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:03,140
probably will and you will get really

00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:06,860
good experience

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,030
and you can say you've had engagement

00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,810
and involvement in these communities

00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:13,520
I'll tell you I hire I do technical

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,220
phone screens I look at resumes and I

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,020
look for things like this I look for in

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,250
the extracurricular activities it's

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,800
great that someone was an Eagle Scout

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,300
it's great that somebody volunteers at a

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,700
soup kitchen I appreciate those things

00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,950
but I look for people that have invested

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,080
in open-source because I know they're a

00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,490
certain kind of person and I know that

00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,080
they have a dedication to what they do

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,700
that they want to know more about their

00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,470
technology and they want to be involved

00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,480
in how it's made and that's a big deal

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,490
when you work in a job like mine were

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,409
understanding something and it's why at

00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,149
its core why we do something with it is

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:47,210
extremely important and that's why I

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,580
think it's important and and the other

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,899
people who are hiring as you begin to

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,760
apply for jobs will look for things like

00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,109
this - this is a great way to get your

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,000
resume bond thought to be honest with

00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:59,299
you so

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,670
um that's my point right it's a call to

00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:04,339
action I am an open source I don't call

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,750
myself an evangelist even and I love

00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:07,130
this stuff if you can't see it I'm gonna

00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,750
kind of hopped up and excited to try not

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,609
to shout I tend to do that so don't want

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,900
to blast you all but I get really

00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,940
excited about open source that get

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,089
really excited about the contributions

00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,369
about what the communities are and how

00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:22,039
they have shaped my career my

00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:25,160
friendships my life how I view things

00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:26,960
and the fact that I can see from

00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,930
multiple levels how the work that we all

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,480
all of us as part of the 30 plus year

00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,730
old open source world have started to

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,890
really change the world around us how we

00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,289
have changed the way that the market

00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:41,839
responds to its customers even the fact

00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:43,730
that we the individual contributor have

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,740
more power over everything now than

00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,180
we've ever had because all of us are

00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,880
part of making this happen so

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,960
I would say go forth and contribute and

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,039
thank you for coming on I have if you

00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,329
want to contact me

00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:01,640
I think these slides go out right so I

00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:03,589
will upload them to schedule so I'm an

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,180
in particular there's one blog I linked

00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:06,890
to down at the bottom from a guy named

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,890
Florian I had to forget to last name I'm

00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:13,849
sorry um about what open source means to

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:18,279
him he's the director at the one of the

00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,279
open source initiative ensorcelled

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:25,819
organizations and he's got this great

00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:27,920
story about how as a non developer it

00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:29,930
similarly to how I ended up in this he

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,490
kind of fell backwards by mistake into

00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,010
open source communities and involvement

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,200
and now his entire world revolves around

00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,700
making it happen

00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,440
and I would say that was very similar

00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,720
for me and I would love to see more

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,760
stories like that out there so thank you

00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,500
for coming please do contribute please

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,970
have feel free to talk to the people

00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,589
that are out there that are at those

00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,270
community booths if that's a project

00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:52,010
you're involved in or want to be they

00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:56,470
are happy to tell you what Nisha's need

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,470
to be filled so thank you have a

00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,800
[Applause]

00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:08,360
questions yeah horse is this microphone

00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,540
this microphone is working great so um

00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,070
as people have questions if you could

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,480
raise your hand I'll try to run the

00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,580
microphone directly to you so we can

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:23,540
capture all of this in a video

00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:27,170
anybody have any questions I'd actually

00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:29,840
like to ask what if that's okay so I'm

00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:33,580
wondering if you have any thoughts about

00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,590
what it takes to sort of overcome the

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,540
sort of technical process issues when

00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,070
you when you're approaching a community

00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,780
looking to contribute something that you

00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:46,160
that you want to be incorporated into it

00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:48,080
so so whether that's like if you have

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,630
documentation that you really want them

00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,130
to to incorporate learning how to make

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,680
the right kind of pull request in the

00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,150
right place that kind of thing have you

00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,790
ever found that that's a little bit

00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,080
difficult or if you found that the

00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,560
people have been willing to help you

00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,680
with that

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,810
what I found is if you state that your

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,450
intention is to help so you come in and

00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,950
say hey I have you know I I documented

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,830
this process that wasn't well documented

00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,300
I'd like to contribute it with somebody

00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,400
you know I would basically state your
