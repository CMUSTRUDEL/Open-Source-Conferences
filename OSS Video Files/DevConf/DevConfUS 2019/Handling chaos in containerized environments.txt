Title: Handling chaos in containerized environments
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Alex Corvin

Unexpected things always happen in production. Robust applications must account for inevitable chaos. In this talk we'll explore methods for detecting, expecting, and automatically handling chaos in applications deployed on Kubernetes and OpenShift. We'll look at this through the lens of the Open Data Hub project, which is a machine-learning-as-a-service platform for running AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes.

This talk will focus on how Prometheus is used to monitor the Open Data Hub, some common failure scenarios that we've detected, how we take advantage of kubernetes features like pod anti-affinity and auto scaling to build resilient applications, and how we can use tools like kube-monkey to create a culture of building resilient applications.
