Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speakers: Jenn Giardino and Christie Molloy

A design system should guide your UI decisions, but not make decisions for you. PatternFly is an open source design system with an initiative to provide UI components that are modular; inspired by principles of BEM and atomic design. In this workshop, members of the PatternFly team will show you how to build complex UI patterns and customize styles using the PatternFly component library.

In this workshop, we'll demonstrate:
- How to use the HTML examples from the PatternFly component library to create new UI patterns
- How to use CSS variables to extend existing components or customize the visual theme 

Attendees interested in participating will need a laptop and a browser.
