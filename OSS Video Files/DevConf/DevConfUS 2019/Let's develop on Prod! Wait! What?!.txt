Do you have confidence that your Test and Stage environments reflect reality? Are they easy to keep up-to-date with production? Can you reproduce production failure in these environments or locally, or seeing failures in Stage not seen in Prod?

It's always been hard to test new functionality before it reaches production. Can you spin up the entire solution on your laptop to debug and test a suspicious piece of code?

Testing on production is no longer a meme. It's reality and a necessity.

Join this session to learn how to safely develop and test your services in a real production environment leveraging Istio on Kubernetes or Openshift. Leave with tools and techniques you can apply right away and with confidence!
