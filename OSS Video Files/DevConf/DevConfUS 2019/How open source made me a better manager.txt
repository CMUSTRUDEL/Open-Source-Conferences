Title: How open source made me a better manager

	Speaker: Allon Mureinik

Management seems like a simple job - you tell people what to do, they do it, rinse, repeat. For bad managers, it really is this simple.

Good managers do things differently. They let team members affect, if not drive, the team's direction. They allow the best ideas to guide the team's activity, no matter who brings them up. They are not intimidated by non-managers displaying leadership qualities, they encourage them.

While these sentiments aren't unique to open source, they are the core of open source communities - allowing individuals to exert influence without any official authority. That's why I think working in open source is the best way to learn how to be a good manager, and I'll try to share this concept in my talk.

so morning everyone welcome you just so

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,529
as I was introduced thank you for that

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,680
my name is Allen Hynek and I'm I work

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,109
for synopsis where I develop where Oh

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,810
jitters sorry about that

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,800
where I manage the development of the no

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,100
js' and.net agents for seeker if you've

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,650
never heard of seeker before it's

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:41,220
probably the best highest solution out

00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:44,729
there if you haven't heard of IIST

00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,670
before it's fascinating as all

00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,760
application security years but it's also

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,559
unfortunately not my topic today so this

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,040
is the last time I'm going to mention it

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,760
I want to start off with a question so

00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:06,450
by show of hands who was at DEFCON 4 CZ

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:09,409
earlier this year awesome so if you've

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,829
never heard about it or haven't attended

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:17,820
first of all I have to recommend I do it

00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:21,539
and that I've been speaking at Def Con

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,490
for CD since 2013 this was actually the

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:26,280
first conference that gave me the

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,189
opportunity to publicly speak it's

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,869
awesome it's really one of my favorite

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,570
conferences throughout the year

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,600
well the DEF CON viewers is kind of

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,310
giving it on for its money so so good

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:44,670
job guys yeah and for our question for

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:47,399
the two of you who were Def Con City did

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,619
you go to DEFCON four CD and must my

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:56,659
talk over there this year by show of

00:01:49,619 --> 00:02:00,389
hands it's a boolean either

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:03,060
well no no hard feelings there were

00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:06,569
quite a few good talks in parallel I'm

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,940
actually bummed I must some of them so

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,250
but back in DEF CON CD I gave a talk on

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,440
how open-source made me a better

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,590
programmer

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,810
I got quite a lot of feedback for it

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,660
quite a bit of it was positive thank you

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,140
and what one bit of feedback kind of

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,740
stuck to me and this feedback said that

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:31,070
I was kind of stretching the truth not

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,290
in the sense that open source won't make

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:37,450
you a better developer it definitely

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:41,720
would but calling myself a developer was

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,660
kind of stretching the truth and the

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,590
reason for this is kind of simple a

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:52,010
developers day should look like this I

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:56,450
see a couple of goons do tools I like to

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,680
use so just say I am NOT going to

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:03,740
entertain the religious debate of

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,440
IntelliJ versus eclipse I'm most

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,520
definitely not going to entertain the

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,250
religious debate of them versus Emacs

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,080
like all religious debates both sides

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,030
have a point and the argument is

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,130
pointless because neither of them will

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,190
convince the other one we aren't going

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,680
to go there if you use whatever tool to

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,870
develop software if it's one of the

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,660
tools over here if it's a tool not over

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,140
here if you use notepad if you use a

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,470
bunch of butterflies if you're creating

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,170
software you are developer no religion

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,000
involved

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:46,040
unfortunately my day doesn't usually

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,550
look like that it looks like this I see

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,550
a couple of people with questioning

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:56,480
looks and a couple of people nodding in

00:03:52,550 --> 00:04:01,270
shared pain so for those of you who do

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,760
not recognize the logos my day mostly

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:09,100
mostly dedicated to fighting a bunch of

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,600
email waiting a bunch of more email

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:17,780
moving tasks around in JIRA and

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:20,080
attending conference calls if you don't

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,520
like ignore these this is great I

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,400
completely envy you

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,020
so going back to the point of feedback

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,770
can I already call myself a developer No

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,580
fair enough

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,450
I get this but I don't think this

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,510
feedback undermines my core point my

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:47,260
core point being that working on open

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:50,260
source has been the most intense and the

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:54,160
most rewarding learning experience in my

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,740
coil so if I can no longer call myself a

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,290
developer but I still want to fly out to

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,770
conferences and give talks kind of

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:05,140
revamped I talked and asked can open

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,140
source can working in open source helped

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:13,419
me become a better manager and I'm going

00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:17,830
to say yes and explain why so first of

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:20,680
all let's start out on square one make

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,889
sure we're all on the same page what is

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,400
being a manager all about so even though

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:30,070
I am no longer developer I retained a

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,830
very important skill for my development

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:37,600
days and I'm still really good at copy

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:40,470
pasting so here's a definition I lifted

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,560
of Wikipedia which I convey to you

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,570
management or managing if the

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,280
administration of an organization

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,590
whether it is a business a

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,460
not-for-profit organization or

00:05:50,590 --> 00:06:02,650
government body or if I summed up really

00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:05,830
quickly word so that was wasn't really

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,020
polite of me it definitely was impolite

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,630
to the hard-working contributors to

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,850
Wikipedia really put in the time and

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,350
create this body of knowledge for all of

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:20,110
us and it really wasn't polite towards

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,240
managers in general although to be

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,970
completely honest I've been doing this

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,440
for give or take 10 years it is the

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,440
truth management

00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,990
the reason it isn't that interesting is

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:38,110
because really isn't that difficult it's

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,240
kind of simple you decide what needs to

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,490
be done you decide who needs to be you

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,800
need to do it he tells them to do it

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:51,069
once repeat simple easy

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,310
well almost at least being a bad manager

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:57,009
is really easy if you if this is the way

00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,090
you manage stuff it's the easiest job in

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:03,340
the world you're definitely doing it on

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,909
being a good manager is really really

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,949
difficult it's really challenging it's a

00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,599
whole lot more than just telling people

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:17,050
what to do and when to do it and how to

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:19,539
do it and well there's a lot that goes

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,460
into being a good manager it's a whole

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:25,659
profession it's a whole skill set but

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:28,569
the one key element in in my mind that

00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:32,020
differentiates good managers from bad

00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:38,020
managers well it sets them apart is

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:40,419
leadership people don't follow people

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,330
who just tell them what to do people

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:47,229
then follow other people by virtue of

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:52,090
some font up title senior manager of

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:54,639
nodejs and.net age nobody cares just is

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,639
not interesting people follow other

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,669
people people follow leaders because

00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:05,349
they're inspired to do so because they

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:08,080
buy into the shared purpose they bind to

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:12,990
a common goal they bind to a path that

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:16,449
will lead us to this common goal and

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,969
well I can't claim I know all the

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:21,879
managers in the world obviously but from

00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:25,469
my own small perspective of being in the

00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,469
tech industry for about 20 years

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,729
100% of the good managers have worked

00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:38,279
for worth what worked for me were good

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,279
leaders regardless of the position or

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:47,329
in contrast 100% of the bad managers I

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:50,199
worked for worth note that I didn't say

00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:53,060
worked for me my don't hire bad managers

00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:56,449
100 percent of the bad managers are

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,009
worked for worth were poor leaders and

00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:00,560
you can really recognize us when you

00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:03,379
step out of the scope that are managing

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:10,759
and see how they interact in other

00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:15,680
places so if we kind of want to talk on

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:18,379
once you talk about sorry how

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,019
open-source can set you up to be a good

00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:24,860
manager first step is to ask how you

00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:28,129
even become a manager now in the tech

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,170
industry more often than not this

00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:31,750
happens by something I like to call a

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,790
reverse promotion

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,149
back home we also call this an Israeli

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:41,170
promotion if you've never heard about

00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:43,699
this this is the weird concept of

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,790
instead of a normal promotion where you

00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:49,610
get the title and do the job that fits

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,790
your position you know reverse promotion

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:55,100
you first do the work you do it well

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,139
enough and long enough invisibly enough

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,459
so you get noticed for doing this work

00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:03,199
and then hopefully someone notices and

00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:05,300
gives you the title or the position to

00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,100
match the work you're doing it's also

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,310
called a reverse promotion because

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,560
usually you just get a bunch of other

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,529
responsibilities and more stuff you need

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,550
to do with exactly zero dollars of a peg

00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:21,740
ways so you kind of fund this new

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:27,910
position by spending more of your time

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:33,350
which is always fun as a side note

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:38,800
there's a small line in this in this

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,800
name can anyone figure out why I'm lying

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,630
because I am lying through my teeth the

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,880
fallacy of the lie here is that

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,580
management is not a promotion becoming a

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,820
manager is not a promotion at least in

00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:01,060
good companies management is a

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,930
profession it has its own skill set has

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:08,670
it has its own way of doing things it

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,510
has its own tasks would need to be done

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,700
transitioning from an individual

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,810
contributor to a management to a manager

00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:20,050
is not a promotion it's a career change

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:22,780
now good companies understand us good

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:26,290
companies have the infrastructure and

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,420
the processors and HR facilities to

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,720
support people who want to changes or

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,490
careers to support quality engineers

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,940
want to become software engineers or

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:39,460
software engineers want to become PM's

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:45,570
or data scientist scientists

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:49,930
sorry or managers training they have the

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:53,440
support system around us bad companies

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,740
don't understand us bad companies kind

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,860
of have this arbitrary cap for

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,850
individual contributors so you go on and

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:08,350
kind of progress in your work and some

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:10,960
point you hit this glass ceiling and

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,200
then your since you good at your job and

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,660
you want to continue advancing your only

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,530
option is becoming a manager which is

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:24,000
horrible because a lot of the time this

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:26,350
isn't done buying isn't done since you

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,070
passionate about management to actually

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,980
want to do this but because you have to

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,640
so you have very good engineers who kind

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,840
of become managers by necessity without

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,730
wanting to be managers without

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,210
understanding the difference in

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:46,770
profession and quite often these good

00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:50,080
engineers become very bad managers

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,720
hopefully in good companies doesn't

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,480
happen good companies will allow you to

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,240
advance as an individual

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,550
a bit throughout your career and will

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,760
allow you to shift to management if you

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,670
actually interested them in this if your

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:09,750
company doesn't have this notion talk to

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:12,959
me later I am recruiting and I do

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:17,449
understand the difference here but sorry

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:20,430
that was kind of a segue don't you get

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:23,820
what does open-source have to do with

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:28,760
all of us for me

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:32,160
everything open-source by definition

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:37,050
does not have titles that does not have

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:40,790
ranks it might have words

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:43,800
open-source has these specific roles of

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,920
maintainer or commits or someone who's

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,190
in charge of something but first of all

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,920
these aren't usually these aren't

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,639
official titles and more importantly

00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:02,430
these are all reverse promotions pleased

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:05,010
most of them 99.999 something percent of

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,740
all these walls people who have been

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:11,130
doing the work and get noticed for it

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,800
and the community by concerns us kind of

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,800
verge them into this new world says hey

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,680
thanks for a great job here's a bunch of

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
new responsibilities for you thank you

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,139
guys

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,699
well you appreciate so this is open

00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,660
source has everything to do with this

00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:33,720
topic the open source is all about being

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,990
able to exert influence without the

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,410
actual authority which is leadership but

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,420
it's very cool once you know how to do

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,740
this properly once you become good at

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:48,990
this becoming a manager is kind of a

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:54,149
non-issue you just continue doing the

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:57,870
same thing with title much to it so how

00:14:54,149 --> 00:15:00,029
do we do this how do we treat working in

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,390
open source as a learning experience as

00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:04,070
something to set us up for becoming

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,850
managers

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:17,690
becoming better management managers at

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:20,000
least first of all to quote another

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,829
great leader be the change you want to

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,769
see almost this is probably a

00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:28,310
misattributed quote but anyway be the

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,149
change

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:34,730
lead by example you cannot expect others

00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:37,970
to do what stuff you aren't willing to

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,920
do but yourself it just does not work

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:46,759
this way if you want people to look up

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,769
to you as a leader you have to walk the

00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,250
walk and not only talk the talk you

00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:54,410
can't go on saying we need to improve

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,800
the quality of this project we need to

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:00,529
make sure that all new PRS have at least

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,300
90 percent code coverage okay great and

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,990
then you go on and submit a bunch of

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:10,670
under untested code it doesn't work

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:12,740
people notice hypocrisy and people do

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:16,399
not follow Hippocrates if you aren't

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:20,149
willing to actively show that eh this is

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,399
doable and B this is important enough

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:27,410
that you are willing to devote your

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,190
effort to it no one else will so this is

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:33,199
critical

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:37,970
this is crucial and this by itself is

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:41,750
not enough not enough for very very

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:46,370
simple reason most of us human beings

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:51,010
are really bad at reading minds we are

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:55,130
not born telepathic we don't just get it

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,370
most of us need to be told things and as

00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:01,930
a famous programming language says

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,930
explicit is always better than implicit

00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,370
we have as leaders we have to convey

00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,899
what we expect from the other members of

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,329
the community

00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:15,569
luckily open source open source

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:19,019
communities as a whole have a bunch of

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:25,319
processes a bunch of cultural aspects

00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:27,089
that really lead into this we we as open

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:32,009
source communities have become really

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:35,220
good at communicating what we want done

00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:38,960
and for this we have backlogs and issue

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:43,139
trackers and feature review processors

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,519
etc etc really good at listening out the

00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:49,649
entirety of work we expect large project

00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,679
better organized projects we've also

00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:55,799
become really good at communicating when

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,850
they want stuff to done to be done we do

00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:04,559
this by splint planning and by

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:08,220
milestones we open-source have become

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,220
quite good at saying we are at feature

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,909
phase we will not review new feature

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:18,450
requests although if you dingus

00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:21,600
correctly you can just say that you turn

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,340
this into a conversation thank you for

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,049
your contribution we are at feature

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,570
phase we went through viewing new

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:31,740
features but we expect this version to

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:38,220
be released on October 23rd after which

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:41,759
we will resume feature of use you then

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,549
just throw stuff up over the wall you

00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,730
also take responsibility for it and say

00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:51,629
ok we won't be doing just now but shares

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:57,710
when I'm gonna get to it and probably

00:18:51,629 --> 00:19:00,600
much most importantly or most obviously

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,179
open-source projects have become really

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,999
good at communicating how we want stuff

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:08,429
to be done and this happens in a bunch

00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:10,769
of different levels okay first of all we

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:12,270
have our coding styles we have our

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:16,100
guidelines

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:18,660
this is how you're supposed to encourage

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,090
the interesting thing to note here is

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,750
you don't necessarily have to have

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:27,300
people involved in this conversation

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:32,580
does your project use a lender of any

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:35,580
suit lending isn't a technical item

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,930
lending is all about communication it's

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,820
a very simple very explicit very cheap

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,580
very obvious way of communicating to

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,980
contributors this is how our code should

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,410
look even though you don't need to have

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,630
anyone else in this conversation I won

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,510
my cara de cemento PR wonder built

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:57,750
locally the lender will be out a bunch

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:00,180
of messages messages use for spaces

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,910
instead of a tab key I use tab instead

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,480
of four spaces here camera case instead

00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:08,940
of snake case vice versa whatever this

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,640
is all about communication this is all

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,140
about telling people how they interact

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,050
with this project in a higher level we

00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:23,460
also have the infamous contributing

00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:26,040
indie file which doesn't just say for

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,140
loop for loop looks like that an if

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,920
statement looks like that but you're

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,230
going to have deeper considerations we

00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,540
are really concerned about the size of

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:41,730
the binary so make sure you never

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,540
statically link anything but only

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,690
dynamically linked or this needs to be

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,340
extra resilient and rely on nothing

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,210
always statically linked all your

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,970
dependencies

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,220
they followed approaches for different

00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:03,180
projects we've become very good at

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:07,500
communicating the highest level probably

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,870
the most most interesting part is that

00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:14,030
open source projects have come to the

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:16,500
realization that people don't

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,900
communicate people don't really interact

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,630
with the source code people interact

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,290
with other people

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:27,320
and since we are very bad at reading

00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:30,530
minds and a lot of us then just get it

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,210
and we need stuff spelled out in the

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:36,380
last couple of years projects have

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:39,440
started adding codes of conduct these

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:44,180
are again documents that say this is

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,610
what what are valid or invalid ways to

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:50,600
interact with other contributors this is

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:52,490
how we can and can't behave this isn't

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,070
to put people on the spot and it is

00:21:52,490 --> 00:22:00,200
unfold lying and saying well in this

00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:02,770
email message from 2013 on your fourth

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,530
line you did this which violate that

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,740
section of the code of conduct you can

00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,420
but that's not really the point it's

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,670
explicitly stating how we want to

00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:17,660
interact how we want our community to

00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:19,850
look and being able to call people out

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,700
and say hey this isn't what we agreed

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,800
about this isn't just my opinion this is

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:36,950
a consensus we have written down yeah

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:40,460
let's try to follow it so as leaders we

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:43,270
started out by leading by example we

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,700
continued with very explicitly

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,770
communicating to our community members

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,850
what and how we expect stuff to be done

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,090
and now we kind of get to the danger

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,940
zone

00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:01,970
because we'll as leaders we will stay in

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,460
the first first term we are starting to

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,640
get noticed people start coming to us

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,260
for questions what what should I be

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,540
doing how should I be doing this and

00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:17,240
this is usually new managers classic but

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:20,300
for you don't have to know all the

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,580
answers it's really fun being the person

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,760
with so answers it feels great to have

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:30,470
people coming to you and saying hey how

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,790
did yes thank you you saved my day it

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,690
makes me kind of feel great I'm a

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,020
superhero

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:39,950
solved somebody's

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:42,800
this is intoxicating it's addictive

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,470
and it's really dangerous because once

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,590
you get too used to this you kind of get

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,920
a swung notion that you have to have all

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,320
the answers all the time which means

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:59,480
nobody else can have any answers because

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:04,030
you have all of them this is doable you

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:07,790
need to be really careful of this good

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:09,830
good leaders aren't intimidated by

00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:13,100
members of the vine communities of the

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:16,400
and teams they aren't intimidated by

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,070
someone else having better ideas good

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,890
leaders celebrators good leaders

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,950
understand that the strength of the team

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:28,190
strength of the community is as strong

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:31,580
as its strongest members and having

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:34,280
other strong members doesn't dilute your

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:38,360
leadership it brings the entire team

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:41,870
forward once you kind of recognize us

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:45,170
and reconciled with us you can start

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:49,070
making better decisions usually by not

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:52,000
making them yourself by not insisting on

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:55,790
having all the answers but by having

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,750
conversations by bringing people in and

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:02,120
saying okay let's talk about this let's

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:07,690
bounce some ideas around let's see what

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:12,080
the best idea is this is great on paper

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:14,570
in practice it doesn't necessarily

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,050
always work not because it's a bad idea

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:20,930
but because people are people quite

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:24,230
often the idea that one's in this

00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:29,770
situation isn't the best idea but the

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:32,840
loudest idea the text version of this

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:35,630
since most open source communities and

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,140
conversation happened in text not in

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:42,380
voice is the idea that presented in the

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:46,110
best English which is kind of a shame

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:50,290
cause open source in its core is

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:52,330
global and distributed and many of us

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:56,050
don't speak English as a first language

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,150
it's our second or third language but we

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,150
still kinda have good ideas even though

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:04,080
our English isn't that great

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:08,110
so if you if you leave this unchecked

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,230
quite often you kind of consolidate on

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:14,590
the most eloquent people people was the

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,810
best in English the people was the most

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,670
free time who can reply to each and

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,300
every email in the mailing list

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:26,700
I cannot right now I have 960

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,700
unanswered emails just in my inbox so

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:33,100
you kind of have these natural people

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:37,930
who evolve as they go to people to

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,940
people with ideas but these are not

00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,980
necessarily the smartest people these

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:46,060
are not necessarily the people with the

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:49,270
best ideas and part of your job as a

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,220
leader as a manager is not not to

00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:53,530
moderate this necessarily not to say

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,240
well shut up like you've spoken enough

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:59,320
give someone else a chance

00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,170
that's a job but making sure that the

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,710
best ideas really emerge and you do this

00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:11,850
by by pulling people into the

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:15,370
conversation but first first of all

00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:18,220
preface for this which again it's kind

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,260
of obvious but as I as I said we are bad

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,430
at reading minds so I'll be explicit

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:28,900
instead of implicit best thing to do is

00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:32,820
to make sure this is a safe space make

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:37,030
sure everyone can voice their opinion

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:39,610
way too many communities where someone

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:43,150
comes up and say yeah he has an idea we

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:48,010
can do the data and quite often they get

00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:50,350
so answer who are you how long have you

00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,180
been welcoming well I've been

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,550
programming since you were doing long

00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,279
division I'm not gonna entertain the

00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:00,969
stones

00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:05,080
to a story I will not name names but I

00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:08,019
actually have a PR which I sent to some

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:11,200
project I won't name and I got an answer

00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:13,929
but you don't even have a PhD you did

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,549
not formally prove this people like you

00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:19,659
should not be writing code okay thank

00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,059
you for your feedback

00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:25,119
this speeds up your process in a factor

00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:27,129
of 15 if you don't want it enter kids

00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:31,989
but thank you for your feedback I'll

00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:34,269
start working on my PhD right now this

00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:37,359
is not a healthy community this is

00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:41,349
definitely bad leadership so the very

00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:43,389
base should be make this safe space make

00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:46,359
sure everyone can voice their opinion

00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:49,450
and if they have a bad idea you can say

00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:51,609
this idea isn't good because X Y Z but

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,859
you're criticizing the idea not the

00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:58,629
person who presented it which is the key

00:28:53,859 --> 00:29:02,499
difference next stages of this is

00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:05,109
actively fooling people in and she

00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:07,629
chooses a right way and a wrong way of

00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:10,239
doing this the wrong way is putting

00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:12,700
people on the spot so surely what do you

00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:15,009
have to say about this this is terrible

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,169
now everyone is looking at her she has

00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:20,589
no idea she's going to be called up and

00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:22,919
chances are she's going to say anything

00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:25,629
to say about this stop looking at me and

00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:30,249
not only have I wasted everyone's time

00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:32,469
I've also created this image of her

00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:35,679
being someone without ideas and no one

00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:38,979
will come to her four years later on so

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:44,009
don't do this sorry surely cuffing

00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:46,539
person the kind of right way to do this

00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:49,330
first of all to lend your own

00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:51,789
credibility outwards especially after

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,669
you've become recognized as a leader

00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:57,639
this community so you can be being a

00:29:54,669 --> 00:30:00,369
discussion and say well this is really a

00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:04,659
complicated problem I'm not really sure

00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:06,999
myself but I know David is really

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,609
knowledgeable he's knowledgeable about

00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:13,809
the subject I'd love to hear his take on

00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:16,690
this so this is completely different

00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:19,059
first of all you want putting someone on

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:22,210
the spot like right now and you are

00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:26,499
lending your credibility it's not just

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:28,629
David what do you think but I know David

00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:31,269
knows a lot about the subject I'd love

00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:33,279
to hear his take doesn't have to be

00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:38,049
right now let's wait for him to chime in

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:43,929
but let's not move forward to reread if

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:46,989
you only want to vamp this up lantus I'm

00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:50,349
sorry but what I like to do is go

00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:52,929
offline and encourage people to come in

00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,700
which kind of looks the same but it's

00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,759
even more powerful because it's done

00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,679
privately so you're going and say hey

00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,799
David I've seen your work over the last

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,639
couple of weeks months whatever well

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,389
impressed by it

00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,809
really love to see you chiming yeah and

00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:12,759
now you can start a feedback loop

00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:15,789
chances are none are going to contribute

00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:17,859
okay why don't why don't you want to

00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:20,320
participate well what's what's the

00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:22,659
missing piece oh you you aren't sure

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,899
about your English okay why don't you

00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:27,609
drop something up bounce it off me I'll

00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:29,619
review it send it back to you and then

00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:31,869
you can present it to the community you

00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:34,029
aren't sure about the idea okay let's

00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:37,379
discuss privately and once you're

00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:41,470
confident enough you can present this

00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:44,159
there are a lot of ways to bring people

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,159
into this discussion

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:53,359
you mean it's kind of the Keen in good

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:56,330
leadership not only managing tasks and

00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:59,210
making sure that this gets done before

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,859
the release and that doesn't and we dot

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,729
the doors our eyes and cost all the t's

00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:07,970
but actually helping us making your

00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:15,679
community stronger back by making the

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:17,179
participants know this I know this

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,090
sounds like a lot of corporate

00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:23,479
management talk kind of half expecting

00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:26,179
me to wear suit and tie and George $500

00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:28,749
an hour because I can your company is

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:35,210
gonna pay about for this anyway

00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:38,749
it really is not it very isn't so here's

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:42,019
a real-life example from a project

00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:45,769
called Mercator it's a mocking framework

00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:47,779
in Java which I started I've been using

00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:50,479
it for years I've started messing around

00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:53,809
with contributions not two or three

00:32:50,479 --> 00:33:00,049
years ago in doing these small things

00:32:53,809 --> 00:33:03,309
and I already got noticed here and this

00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:07,129
is the feedback for one of my peers were

00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:11,869
maintained discuss technically what's

00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:14,330
going on and yeah actively publicly is

00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:16,429
reaching out and saying well you've done

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,440
a lot of cleanup work and a lot of bug

00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:20,989
fixes do you want to contribute an

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,099
enhancement here's something I think

00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:28,720
could be interesting for you this ended

00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:31,820
up being one of the major feature I

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:37,340
think it was to 1712

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:41,059
a couple of years ago but to check out

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:44,539
the link if you really interested this

00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:47,539
works I don't know this person I never

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:50,980
met him I don't know where he works

00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:53,260
I have no idea if he's a manager or not

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,039
but but this is definitely leadership

00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:59,649
this is in the open-source space no

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:04,090
money involved no corporate management

00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:05,710
no nothing this is how you like people

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,440
out how you help them grow

00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,349
I make them more prominent more

00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:16,119
effective contributors to your project

00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:18,520
now if you can do this in open source if

00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,849
you can most definitely do this within

00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:27,970
your own teams within your own quotes

00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:29,859
and stuff you manage I'll share the

00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:38,290
slides of course if anyone wants a link

00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:41,470
later a last thought the last notion we

00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:44,500
as managers love to measure things just

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:47,020
kind of is corporate management we get

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:52,030
hit up a lot with numbers and metrics

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,980
and measurements and we often spend a

00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:56,829
lot of our times for playing slide

00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,410
shaytans showing twelve point four point

00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:02,410
five twelve point four five at least

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,530
percent improvement here and there so he

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:09,819
has a metric for you as managers in the

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:11,890
last week month year how many people

00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:15,390
have you helped to become better

00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:18,400
contributors have you helped promote

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:25,200
have you helped become leaders in the

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:28,569
universe if the answer to this is zero

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,849
in my opinion and I really don't care

00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:33,190
about your performance of you in your

00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:35,619
current company as a manager if the

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:39,329
answer to this is zero you are not doing

00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:42,869
your job this is not good management and

00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:42,869
that's how

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:51,109
we have the handheld mic in this room if

00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:52,309
anyone has a question you can raise your

00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,729
hand it I can try to get the microphone

00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:54,729
to you

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,940
so you started with some examples of

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:06,740
various corporations have you had

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,680
experience with organizations that

00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:15,350
separate sort of HR management from

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:19,520
technical leadership well first of all

00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:24,290
yes definitely the different companies

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:28,010
kind of do this in different ways if if

00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:29,870
you started managing in the 98 1980s and

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:34,100
your organization is still stuck there

00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:37,160
they calls us matrix management where

00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:41,600
you have your HR manager and Project

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:44,960
Lead you need to report to this can work

00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:50,330
great if they both know what they were

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:52,100
doing and actually talk to each other it

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,400
really depends how you implement this

00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:58,070
because quite I want I want say often

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,780
but it isn't going to happen that these

00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:04,370
two functions tend to talk to each other

00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,260
and then you have your functional lead

00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:09,050
who is sure you're going to deliver

00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,900
feature by the end of the week and it's

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:14,480
planning on the next big feature for the

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,550
next year while your HR manager knows

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,910
that you're going on vacation for this

00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:22,520
week and you intend to turn just

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:26,060
transition to product management so you

00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:30,080
won't be doing the next feature I think

00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:32,560
it is okay it it is it is a valid

00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:36,320
structure of management but

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,360
communication is key first of all the HR

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,510
manager has to communicate with the

00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:48,230
functional leads or technical leads ivme

00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:50,720
: second the function the HR manager has

00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:53,120
to at least have a notion of what's

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,510
going on you can't have these

00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,630
conversations where the tech lead says

00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:02,360
okay we'll have your program and doing

00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:05,200
this on that and the HR manager kind of

00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,200
blankly stare

00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:11,310
good idea and can we have logging on

00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:14,490
that place also you have to the HR

00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:19,050
manager has to at least have a say just

00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,620
understand what's going on so this can

00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,440
work

00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,450
I think it works really well if you have

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,060
really good technical people and really

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:32,010
good HR managers who are really good at

00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:35,580
talking to each other usually in my

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,620
experience you just add spots here HR

00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,930
manager can just be bad that's our job

00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,330
technical manager can just be bad at a

00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,640
job and even if they're both great but

00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:48,150
they then talk to each other you have

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,460
another spot I'm not a fan but if it

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:54,510
works for you quite more power to you I

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,890
think we still have about five minutes

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,890
for questions does anyone have questions

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,950
if that does conclude questions I'd like

00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:11,010
to remind you all that I believe lunch

00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:13,350
is going to be starting it's gonna be

00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:20,700
