Management seems like a simple job - you tell people what to do, they do it, rinse, repeat. For bad managers, it really is this simple.

Good managers do things differently. They let team members affect, if not drive, the team's direction. They allow the best ideas to guide the team's activity, no matter who brings them up. They are not intimidated by non-managers displaying leadership qualities, they encourage them.

While these sentiments aren't unique to open source, they are the core of open source communities - allowing individuals to exert influence without any official authority. That's why I think working in open source is the best way to learn how to be a good manager, and I'll try to share this concept in my talk.
