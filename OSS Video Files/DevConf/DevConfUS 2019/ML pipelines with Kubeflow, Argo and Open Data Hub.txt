	Speakers: Juana Nakfour and Peter MacKinnon

Data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers rely heavily on creating workflows to train, verify, and deploy ML models. Argo is a cloud-native workflow management tool that enables the creation of sophisticated native Kubernetes ML workflows. Kubeflow is an ML toolkit that incorporates best-of-breed ML projects (for example, TensorFlow) as well as providing important infrastructure such as hyperparameter tuning. The Open Data Hub (ODH) is a scalable data lake platform that provides tools such as distributed Spark and Ceph data store. In this presentation we will explore workflow features available using Argo running as a component of Kubeflow and integrated with ODH. Presentation will include a live demonstration of ML workflows using Kubeflow, Spark and Ceph.
