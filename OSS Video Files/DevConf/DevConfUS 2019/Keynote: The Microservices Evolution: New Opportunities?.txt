Title: Keynote: The Microservices Evolution: New Opportunities?
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Idit Levine

Who are you? You are a talented Java developer who has been using Apache Kafka in your projects On-Premises for a long time, as well as writing code to write and read data to/from topics. However, your manager asked you to design an architecture in which both Apache Kafka and your code will run in the Cloud, and just like that, you find yourself worried about being able to deliver this project.

This talk will demonstrate that there is nothing to be worried about, though you may need to learn a few tips and tricks along the way to ensure the success of your project. We'll use live demos to show which changes your architecture and code should undergo, as well as discuss the kinds of problems that often arise in cloud deployments.

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,939
nobody might have anticipated as they

00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,650
were presenting and I'm the father the

00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:23,390
CEO of July ups and and this this either

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,949
doesn't look very technical that this

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,840
talk will be technical there will be

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:28,730
happy with their honest answer because

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,619
that's what I'm going to do so hopefully

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,390
hopefully it will be interesting so

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,830
let's start about talking about their

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,660
pollution what we don't know right now

00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,420
so here's what we see when we are

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,719
talking to a customer we no exception

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,059
they all trying to get become more enemy

00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,450
so they don't have like a transformation

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:49,280
journey and they always starts with what

00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,039
everybody's talking about it today which

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,920
is microservices the complication and

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,230
it's one week binary and they are really

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,890
interested in whether to micro services

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,030
we can we'll talk in a second about why

00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,670
but then when they're moving their

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,619
weather will discover that there is the

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,840
challenge of rewriting the application

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,930
but that's when it's fully start and

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,450
actually way more complex after for

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,630
instance simple stuff like now you're

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,200
way more a bi how do you manage them or

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,600
some problem like how something simple

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,189
like do services are the communicate to

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,229
each other either make sure that the

00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:30,350
equipment came in really really safe way

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,700
the security and then how do you make

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,380
sure that you understand what's going on

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,750
with all those micro services right now

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,030
and all this work today so bad

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,640
technology for my a services so that

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,800
sounds like the negative

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,870
talking about so we will go there with

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,880
will quite a lot on this but I'm

00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,800
personally believe they're actually

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,870
what's special about service mesh it's

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,450
not that to be problem that people claim

00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,940
that it's only today which is security

00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,610
robbery and observability

00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,530
I wonder the beautiful service man is

00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,360
the deployment itself but we just

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,100
they basically obstructing the network

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,940
and if you have started in the network

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,709
there is way more we can do and that's

00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,570
the view right it's specifically

00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,670
focusing for instance on the health but

00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,930
there is a lot more to do because the

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,120
way that the talk do you think so this

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,340
is really really high level just to

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,390
explain what to date people doing now we

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,070
do the name too

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,910
and we'll try to focus on understand

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,680
there okay so micro services and so

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:30,040
micro services improve us a lot of stuff

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,170
doctor body why first of all you just

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,900
getting better agility right that can go

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:39,550
so fast in our company today though

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,310
really really fast and the reason is

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,900
because

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,940
I can abstract everything while

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,750
everything is gray small and if you go

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,480
very fast

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,860
mr. InDesign we actually we have to

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,410
design an application that's the right

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,090
way to do this right this abstract

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,860
itself it's a make sure that the team

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,140
comes with the logic in the right places

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,790
and so on and it's very flexible I don't

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,319
care which language videos I don't care

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,180
what you're doing it's just really

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,550
really letting you go take all the

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,760
constraints in mind that's great but

00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,020
there is a lot so certainly everything

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,390
isn't right

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,070
there's no microservices right before

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,019
that they always in one binary you

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:18,260
didn't really take little to take care

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,390
of it traffic I think was one buyer it's

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,920
pretty simple but now it's just a minute

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,470
and we've distributed there was a lot of

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,180
power so the complexity understand

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,739
what's going on now the donut

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,480
application in one place with all the

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,040
logic that will be pretty simple to

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,110
figure out there's a lot of micro

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,819
services there is a duplication right

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,069
there the replication with each of them

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,410
so how do they understand what really

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:42,019
great work of course performance again

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,730
we're playing studies before that the

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,880
majority of the problem that you are we

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,980
our contention is you know words and to

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,019
see that it's working well and so on but

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,760
now putting everything on the network so

00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,590
legacy would be a big problem for

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,540
application you need to make sure that

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,670
you micro services are resilient and

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,769
that's me you know is this is a whole

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,680
new story in terms of course of course

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,939
you know it's harder there is a lot

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,219
that need to be released even if it's

00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:07,930
complicated and the last one is the

00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:10,480
testing so you before that I can run

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,299
some unit tests different and be very

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,920
helpless antigen test now the scholar to

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,289
me to do that integration test it's very

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,049
complex there's a lot of affair of

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:21,940
moving part so you know again we like

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,350
everything that we do in our community

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,030
and I'm you know I'm developers

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,400
community really active is that we

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,560
always sold in the bottom but then we

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,180
did you see a field of new performances

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,919
so and that's where their program is

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,770
coming from companies like solo and

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,840
credit right thank you

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,310
okay so again just an fact our going

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,380
into range is to make sure that no

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,520
clever software to make sure that

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,030
everybody understand what I'm talking

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,830
about

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,770
again everything was before anyone big

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,270
binary all the logic of application if

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,120
you want to scale it you have to scale

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,190
called application all those final even

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,960
if it seemed that only one of the little

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,050
logic is the one that you need to stand

00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,889
still miniature scale which is very you

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,560
know expensive

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:05,050
now we did with the middle is very good

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,780
works of Health but we kind of like

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,610
lowers the state application because it

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,660
before that I could just princess attach

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,550
a debugger to my bike

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,259
now it can because there is so many and

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,090
he took them doing different stuff I can

00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,979
just the fact of the bugger the spread

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,450
is the stitches expended all over the

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,620
place then he made a very nice

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,060
[Music]

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,419
microservices but this is the real world

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,370
right this is what big there is and this

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,910
is an example of the amount of micro

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,130
service that you supposed to minute and

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,430
then you're going to Twitter and you see

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:46,090
that right and this is true this is what

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:49,240
we're dealing with today right so so

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,800
again really really important we didn't

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,289
you to move to actually go to the right

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,289
direction for a lot of contracts with us

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,970
we need to help fix them it's not

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,940
finishing on the application itself

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,159
now it's also back to the tool right

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,960
most of the people that I'm also the

00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:07,449
customer that we have today as a

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,659
monolithic application and the way the

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:13,210
wedding is not buying the right pretty

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:14,949
good way is not to just be like because

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,740
you know they working on this and they

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,849
continue a new feature there is a big

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,710
organization in the new team they all

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:22,599
think there's a lot of problem but we

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,880
will need to do is to do what lifted but

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,030
wither did but he somehow find a way to

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,639
do those application to dinner and move

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,039
micro services and kind of like look to

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,380
the user like which one verification and

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,780
then start ripping it up so that means

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,090
that in the current situation you may

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,880
have an application that will more than

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,830
only micro services to pay attention but

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,150
also still the monolithic or maybe we

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,240
want to go all the way from surveillance

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:52,400
and that mean

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,530
this is an example met weight before it

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,590
ain't being in the world now there is

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,750
great you know a lot more metrics a lot

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,460
more busyness in your cluster and

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,530
therefore permitting us probably will

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,450
grind solution when we're talking about

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,400
locking same thing before the healthy

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,350
not just develop them but they also

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,840
should be fine but now it's all

00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,420
distributed and replicated so how do I

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,670
know where it was actually left the web

00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,870
to dig a lot and what you're doing in

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,180
that case is doing something called

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,610
transactional work and that's a that we

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,800
need to be vanadium the beginning of the

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,750
transaction and make sure that it's

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,790
follow all the way from all the micro

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,920
services and then take the log based in

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,110
this of this transaction to make sense

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,970
repetitive way more more flex so you

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,220
need something like open forever to me

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,780
so there was I'm just going to say that

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,020
it was before today calling it open

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,930
tracing then Google decided to complete

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,610
and echoing it open consensus and now

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,700
they merge together under the open

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,320
telemetry / in terms of debugging I

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,680
don't know can everybody by

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,350
rectification just a touch it but it

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,530
will be you know GDP this is the one and

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:03,110
I know when I came and I had one of the

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,400
engineer or TMC before and one friends

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,560
in engineering you would have and

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,000
basically by the problem significance

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,030
attached debugger registered to me

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,919
bother because you're not a family right

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,050
what you going is imprinted you travel

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,850
surely you're taking log we're not done

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,990
in it but that's not what we're getting

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,610
so if you're looking in there oh you

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,020
know if you don't do it maybe about

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:30,210
today you can't apply that to myself

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,490
detector you know that word from SOS

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,490
[Music]

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,079
for deployment so you know again if

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,579
before they didn't use something like

00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:40,139
configuration management that's when

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:41,940
your makes sense anymore so you would

00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,500
need to move to something like a long

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,680
wedding and in 20

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,630
you know object in kubernetes and then

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,399
the last Chris test again before that it

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,949
was a lot of beauty test and a little

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,589
bit of integration their snouts provide

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:58,139
a little bit of that unit has gotten a

00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,410
lot and very nicely in the question

00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,670
please

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,959
so again it's all and in the nutshell

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,880
this is what happened we took this

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,889
monolithic application because small

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,870
pieces removing it the connection of

00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,730
acknowledge to the Internet and simple

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,470
compact as I said before how

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,240
microservice can communicate to each

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,360
other I'm going to do it in a very

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,220
secure way and how we understand what's

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,560
going on welcome what's going on in the

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,279
system it's a problem that we need to

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:31,019
solve and those the problem the service

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:33,110
which is trying to so service anybody do

00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,110
you

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,889
so what is service to service which

00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,079
today's practice of three major one the

00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:48,000
first one is securing right so what is

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,079
going to do it's going to the rate

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,370
certificate for you

00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:55,889
MPLS important if you be talking about

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,899
observability we're going to do with a

00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:00,230
page focusing of methods logs and if you

00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,990
talk in a variety going to talk about

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,450
traffic control and resilient something

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,779
like for injection like wheat rice and

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,250
so on this is in the natural I have just

00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,290
two people that don't know and trust me

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,260
I'm going to go very fast on this and

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,420
they will do stuff anyway so in the end

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,860
of the day or micro-services and what

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,920
we're doing in serve especially putting

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,750
what college site current proxy next to

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,209
it and what we doing is be pretty

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,920
treating the IP table that every

00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,839
communication to the micro services

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,790
every communication out of the micro

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,470
service is going to go through this box

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,019
and this box is something that I can

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:41,480
configure but to figure it I can control

00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:44,000
all of this yes so this is in a nutshell

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,040
our your cluster will break down you

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,990
will have five and if that doesn't apply

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,480
micro services the first thing that you

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,949
will need to do you still need to write

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,959
the end of the day you need to make sure

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:57,470
that the entry to the pasture is first

00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,910
secure it's very safe you don't it

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,130
doesn't make you specifically micro

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,870
services that did that they did you know

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,640
that the people themselves our would

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,870
take care of security and so on probably

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,940
didn't start with them and that's

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,079
exactly I get will explain and that

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,899
would take care of everything that

00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,790
related to the traffic that is nor what

00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:16,370
yourself yeah I think that it's going to

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,529
do you would going to put aside comics

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,300
to everybody services and that's we're

00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:24,110
going to take care of the traffic of

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:26,600
east-west so you have a lot of 14 now so

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,460
money to manage them and you know eighty

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,620
I get will movement into the

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,510
- right because the conversion should be

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,250
different you know it's a little bit

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,170
more dangerous because its founding in

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,399
eternal Footwear versus when the

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,430
communication is between two

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,950
microservice which already go to one of

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,300
the ABI gateway and that will get the

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,279
configuration for the service which

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,050
controller so what will happen is that

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,910
every time that the traffic coming to

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,740
your class to go to the parts of the

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,779
edge and every time that the traffic

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,089
moving inside the glass there it will go

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:58,040
it will go for the proxy that configured

00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,630
by the service just pretty simple now

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,910
you are practically right it's pretty

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,330
simple every communication between them

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,920
is being kept skip go below it can be

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,200
able to make it this big definition

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,240
access what you know Kenny allowed not

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,880
allowed to talk to disguise is that

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,130
secure answer okay so in a nutshell

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,899
because a lot of us are specialist of

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,670
functions I mean I can explain what it

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,230
is it's really cool there is a lot of

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,240
confidence building is right now I

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,010
didn't feel as a company that wanted my

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,760
research to build it I mean we help you

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:33,020
but I didn't want that because I believe

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,240
that is everything will be what but

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,790
actually did you see this technology

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,170
there is way more complex and even

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,580
appearing to the street sure and what I

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,100
try to figure out is what will be the

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,730
next well after service that will be in

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,520
come on

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,010
so let's look like now in a month here

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,209
is the market intervention right this is

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,190
what my customer is there for any

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,400
customer that I heard they study with us

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,770
why Google but it's pretty simple a lot

00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,779
of marketing they will start with s T so

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,820
as soon as it we say is a service

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,430
finished and based on interpret see that

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,480
came from they will stop at it and very

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,570
quickly the

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,460
that's great like everything Google is

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,830
really good in today about oh my god

00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,240
everything's overcomplicated and to be

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,670
honest with my customer doesn't have

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,400
that mean that would affect their

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,230
infrastructure so you know you care so

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,940
much to make it sell for things so they

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,230
will start with that and they would also

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,970
like they will follow that's the only

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,280
time they will wait for whether or not a

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,650
company to act this way then they will

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,300
use to leave early so the first server

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,920
is actually coming a service which

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,830
actually came from a company called

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,350
buoyant the people who Twitter and in

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,240
the World Series match there they

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,800
basically our they announced the still

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,980
in Turkey and the first version of it

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,110
they created with a Java side straight

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,740
to God because people calling usually a

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:54,230
site down a sidecar this literally was a

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,210
busker it was you know which they didn't

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,850
actually put up it was crazy

00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,520
so wasn't really are working that it

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,010
wasn't perfect solution therefore SPO

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,110
Google started it started to compete but

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,440
they made a new one and the volume a

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,180
failed in dignity Buena and basically

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,740
they based it on their own parks you

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,440
reading in verse the different all gonna

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,120
go so people will try that but here's

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,550
the problem the movie star it's not

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,170
build a rental and here's the thing we

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:27,500
are Google community enjoy it with us I

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,240
should come everybody's person and every

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,790
don't want we're going to go way faster

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,410
this is the powerful and therefore they

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,780
just cannot keep up with a feature that

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,050
there is name so they can find the

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,910
Lavinia so people will be very afraid to

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,310
but that and they will move to something

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,470
like console which is already very good

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,720
with as well be helpful the first

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,370
version of a console but they're behind

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,100
they just recently announced a similar

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:54,740
support and to refer that in several

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,790
several isomeric service not the only

00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,259
thing that is interesting is that

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,089
they're separately but everything to the

00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,930
application so if you don't have it

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,939
doesn't really matter

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,680
they also behind that they're not giving

00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:07,550
a support of the proxy itself but they

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,350
actually not to encourage us and you see

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,029
more and more and maybe here in NWS

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,490
we'll go to a French which is their

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,689
solution it's pretty difficult with

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,569
everything that they have that

00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:20,720
experience so again a customer's one and

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:22,970
usually by and never having a decoder

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,790
because it's too complicated

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,610
so all this investigation goes way way

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,009
easier if you put some obstruction on

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,889
top and that was always a real problem

00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:38,059
the first one it can cover an easier ABI

00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:40,879
and estimates that's right so

00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:43,220
complicated then the second thing that

00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,870
we can do is we basically can add their

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,730
burden that if a customer wanted to try

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,379
they don't need to learn all those

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,709
anything it's enough that they would own

00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:53,149
one API that is very solid and have them

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,949
the other thing is that even if they

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,389
wanted to start with a heavy but they

00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,639
further thing they would not be the

00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,559
weaker one and we all know that people

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,660
choose before they do not make business

00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,610
and clouds and early and doctor swarm

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,470
they need it to draw away all the stuff

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,720
that they didn't know so most likely

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,129
again and what they will do is that they

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,689
will want to switch with this

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,569
obstruction where they give you that and

00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:17,720
then the last one is that again just

00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:19,939
keeping texting so that's what we did

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,040
and actually the last you know we're now

00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:24,559
some important core super glue here ago

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,440
the vision once again is the first one

00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,390
is

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,640
structure that easy to work when I'm

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,350
using s here I need to create four

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,540
different object to define the service

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,510
in order to give every tribe what that

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:40,500
says let's let them do a read by Google

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:43,410
to the bacchanal system so we created

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,210
those API and our product was doing

00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,190
distillation of service pledge of

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,100
workers during discovery over-the-air

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,570
install a very simple way to nominee one

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,610
would list of all the servicemen to

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,800
marry to that and also grouping them

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,820
together because what if I have two

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,610
incidents of serviceman on prayer and al

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,920
AWS up mess and what an item is one big

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,480
cluster service which we like to do this

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,189
if we would be able to actually group

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,290
them together and black the networking

00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,050
because all of them use again boy it can

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,670
be a very interesting stuff so we get

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,110
all of this and Microsoft reach out to

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,209
us they are the planning tool of the

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,520
basically doesn't any story for say for

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,930
a service man so the basic that Richard

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,640
glass except we don't like your story

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,920
and we wanted to actually take these

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,079
things and put it up so we're now in the

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,540
last foot but this is the game for my

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,510
Microsoft where now is SMI service

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,780
machine elements that's basically an API

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:39,210
that making way simpler than 15 SPO and

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,270
others and it is making the interface of

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,450
if someone into a service man that's

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:50,130
what we do by a corner and because it's

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,740
Microsoft I managed to convince a boil

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,419
and I should talk to John Deere's and

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,990
what other computer and current weather

00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:00,780
will become creating this nice community

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,520
and the reason we did all of this asked

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,080
as a company is because what I think

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,130
that it's very interesting is what is

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,660
going to come on top right so this is

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,309
what we did with servicemen right the

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,559
first thing that we did is is before

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:15,630
that all this logic of that okay I will

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,760
take operationally was built in

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,830
communication and every time that there

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,530
is someone needed to change in their you

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,210
know a library to operate you need to

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,340
operate to micro services now we took it

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,559
out and if we took it out it was way

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,210
more we can do and that's what you write

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,490
basically putting the staff on top of

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,200
the services to make it and easy to work

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,150
so the first thing that we do it we have

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,090
any idea where that is very innovative

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,100
build like it already forgiven VI sturdy

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,110
base type or services fill the top

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,450
defense worker glue so you know

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,250
basically created a plan that we work

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,510
seamlessly mean every server smash the

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,640
second thing is that we believe that

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,919
everybody should do this community a

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,600
customer and so and when we do it this

00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,750
basically if you think what we did

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,669
becomes like created a platform right

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,340
and I saw something like that what do

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,080
you ever you have been building to stop

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,940
application becoming building and the

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,620
reason it's coming built in is because

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,620
that giving you them that's the basic

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,360
functionality they perform right for my

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,919
opinion the basic functionality that you

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,169
need but not your infrastructure should

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,030
be an API get ready surface patch

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:19,380
together they're strapped for your

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,200
network and that's really really

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,510
important but like I thought there is an

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,460
answer you can actually extend them and

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,200
that's exactly where we're going with it

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,330
so chaos engineer

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,009
it sounds way more intense because you

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,440
don't need to put an import library to

00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:36,239
do at home it's not a hot specific you

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,940
can actually just inject it on the box

00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:40,529
deliver same thing something like canary

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,450
deploy to make a lot of sense

00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:43,859
if it's not done to service measure 20 I

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,539
get but we need to make sure that we'll

00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:48,749
get them right and that's exactly the

00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:52,289
next second so I'm sure we'll do what

00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:53,999
we're doing it's all open source you're

00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:56,179
going to buy that and our shirts from

00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,179
them

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,759
[Music]

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,890
[Music]

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:37,490
so that's so what I have here is a very

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:42,530
simple which is who's yelling that's you

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:43,490
over whatever basically I'm just showing

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,080
you everything that I have in the

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,270
cluster right now and kubernetes cluster

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,340
Oh Mike I can see that in my class sir I

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,940
have the names before you know reports

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:56,690
of cool right and never install a still

00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:00,710
pretty simple just to play on it so now

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:03,110
let's look at work with it so we each

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,490
play again you can go to do it you're

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:10,580
going to date is something called

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:12,530
service make that I know if you just get

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,120
it we're home version of what we do and

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,780
basically what it is is that I just

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,960
mentioned

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,420
Ahmed I'm anything SPO and I'm anything

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,450
victory but this is possibly the only

00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,800
one because so let's just go man live

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,600
install it on plastic so it's very

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,850
simple the only thing that are going to

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,540
do right now so it's an empty Buster oh

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:38,450
sorry this and I'm just basically

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,360
exploding right now on my glass

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,220
so I'm taking the service Bashar is so

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,000
delivering my faster because that would

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,000
mean it's me

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,020
okay so basically just starting it will

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,660
download some mail but their parents

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:06,330
pretty simple we can just stalling its

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,680
movement it's fantastic and whether the

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,810
next thing which is basically port

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,910
forwarding now everything that I'm doing

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,310
right now is a new ideas because to them

00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,750
but actually everything is based opción

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,630
behind the scenes or if it doesn't end

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:24,680
right now it can be done we could see ya

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,680
in our CLI or we be blind so

00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:47,180
it's like okay so now what I'm going to

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,220
do is for fourteen to bring it to my

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,560
computer and the last thing that I would

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:57,770
like to do is to come here and very

00:22:51,560 --> 00:23:00,260
simply loop here and what you can see is

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:03,170
that in my class they already recognize

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,490
that there is an sto discovered it

00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,380
already discovered there still than

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,410
running they say that it's healthy and

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:12,260
they actually also recognized already

00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:14,120
which there is a basic project right so

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,190
it's pretty simple discover that in this

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,720
way the other thing you know just to

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,900
show you how simple it is I think I

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,820
meant just for fun let's go install

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,980
another one good student hotel and

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:31,670
that's with it including just for fun

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:33,590
let's put it on namespace justice so

00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:39,650
next year I had already installed our

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:41,420
story so we started as you can see what

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,260
is doing it but we are going to go to

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,240
sto itself and we're going to

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,100
standing so what does he mean expanding

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,470
lets you know a lot of the tablet crisis

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,640
care is coming already with witness but

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,410
there is a lot of stuff that server

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,270
smash is not coming with vs. canary

00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,060
deployment slacker is an open source

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,280
platform we would the monitoring is

00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,560
abducted a stuffing you do bananas video

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,170
service path is made clear that we'll be

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,840
able to canary york we do deployment

00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,370
you know it's watching a video see if

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,250
you see any problem is rolling back

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,810
pretty simple right but working

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,400
consistent when you're deploying like to

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,990
fly again there's a lot of work that you

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,880
need to do so are we done is pretty

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:21,240
simple we already know which movie to

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,460
use so we took our class customizing

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,750
period a very strong female important

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,220
system that will allow us to basically

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,980
governor and an asterick

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,740
you know basically customized so

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:35,660
basically we layered it with integration

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,660
within again we can just for fun go and

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,040
write and when you see that we're going

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,110
to the mattress go ready install another

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,090
match which is the debit already working

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:58,080
in solely his fellow servants quarters

00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:00,210
in the sidecar and what we're going to

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,430
do next just a solid api get way between

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,430
stolen again with us this down from our

00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:08,620
one that builds who can install it on st

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:11,920
okay so no negative negative

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,330
it doesn't ever work so coming here and

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,590
again it's pretty similar it's a sex

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,970
trade for this will be the future

00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,170
eventually for the enterprise now

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,650
everything that I did when I was

00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,390
basically ridiculously amazing

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,520
technology of the understand so go look

00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,420
at it it's already and go and it's

00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,090
really pretty

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,860
so it's really really you know pretty

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,780
simple and you know I can show you that

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,790
actually install a reality but that's

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,320
gonna fight on in the beginning so that

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,490
in the natural did you get work for

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,500
different here and should stay there

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,059
uber rise dimensions in the end of the

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,950
day that's what you need to do you need

00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:45,340
to put them together also reflect them

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,100
and there is great more so just not sure

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:59,140
that make sense so far

00:25:47,100 --> 00:26:00,520
so so what is so there's a lot of

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,650
comment service pension this is an

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,650
example of it winters in the internet

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,630
actually that was a long time ago

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,850
because right now I still is way more

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,890
than for Italy I think is like 60 or 70

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,210
at API home so you've got the

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,860
commonalities that way that we've

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:18,640
actually need to figure out what to do

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,800
and if you think about it there's two

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,170
things that you need to do a servicemen

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,510
in terms of configuration the first one

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,780
you need to actually configure dimension

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:32,710
itself or get way you know internal

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,510
external MPLS that's one thing but then

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,860
you are also too late to date it was

00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,570
version that are more active for

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,750
instance including a new application so

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,480
lowering and so on so food rerouting in

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,309
the day-to-day

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,320
we already makes it better the decima

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:48,200
but it would be much simpler and we'll

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,880
be able to lose but what we didn't do is

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,649
for the Construction Set and that's

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,080
where most of the pen for our customer

00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:55,970
are is that you know when you actually

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,679
deploy a dark area not starting from

00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,899
scratch right I mean you never started

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,820
expected but there is those layers in a

00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:03,440
docker file but you can actually start

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,090
from every point you want but when you

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,659
install service Nitra starting from

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,610
scratch

00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,080
so we think that we can together and

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,210
what we did we basically layer the

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,669
configuration the following its flavor

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,230
and you can actually can discover flavor

00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,659
from cluster that exists or you can

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,960
create one and then basically you can

00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:22,480
actually go and apply so you can see on

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,820
this service patch of these clusters

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,230
with this flavor this configuration with

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,370
this everything and just okay the second

00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,809
thing is that is the biggest problem

00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:36,049
that exists today and every organization

00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:38,510
for it of the service meniscus every

00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:40,549
time that application only one intrusion

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,039
application the first thing that we need

00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:45,649
to do is to deploy those you know create

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,870
those libraries networking platform

00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:51,860
policy telemetry and that's all from

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,630
there the example of bursting and then I

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,419
just click on the networking and that

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:59,120
starts the fire to them to talk them but

00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:01,399
for a younger than you are expected of

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,470
the gate in order to create now that

00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,210
doesn't mean I don't want application

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,809
another capable of doing it I don't want

00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:11,029
application home owner

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:13,460
so the question is how to get this this

00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:15,379
is the biggest problem now it's not that

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,960
surprising because as I said as they are

00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:20,120
being done by Google engineers look at

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,070
interview probably can do it oh the most

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,960
of them to the enterprise you do not

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,970
want the user to know that we don't want

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,350
application to understand so one thing

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,139
that we do is we basically need to come

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,340
across like a CIC this is their

00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:33,559
liability and kind of like an interface

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,720
between the application owner and what

00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,929
they are and 2010 to August

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,330
yes and the last one is that service

00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:43,999
much trouble so here's what we just

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,519
created something is wrong doc dictation

00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:49,149
is my work here is ready 50 minutes the

00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:53,119
first one maybe two for support

00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:53,809
yesterday one maybe service maximum the

00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,619
third one

00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:59,269
maybe it's an apipa get before the last

00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,999
one maybe it's a service metric the

00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:04,070
first problem how do you find good like

00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:05,659
it's crazy so this is another something

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,009
that we walk in on right now we're

00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:08,360
basically taking all the sphere deform

00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:10,639
all of them and all the snap should be

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,899
making sure it we can actually and the

00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:23,419
same word empowerment and okay so that

00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:24,499
was a lot something will really go and

00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:26,539
then that's something that I'm

00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:27,950
passionate about it we open so the

00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:29,870
working on it we believe that we open

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,480
source it's very strong

00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,549
okay so when I looked at when we talked

00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,230
about the department before I was when I

00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:38,640
saw that it doesn't know what the

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,559
battery is the first thing that we did

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,640
is it created for the post-war and

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,070
what's what she's doing is basically

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,600
orchestration for the bottom so why I'm

00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,549
sure it's working with them and then I

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,429
will show you our dipping to the service

00:29:47,549 --> 00:30:02,480
metric or into the production so that

00:29:50,429 --> 00:30:04,880
would be you don't know what it is

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,540
so in a second what you will discover is

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,490
spinning second it obeah and what this

00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,350
course is basically doing is very simple

00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,120
it's giving you bringing with a regular

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,429
debuggers that worked with it all the

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,110
time all the way to variety and be able

00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:20,429
to actually installing you know

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,590
basically use them in serving in

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:24,720
improving on is in fact it's not related

00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:27,750
to service it's just group identity it's

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,790
free and it's open source really offer

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,809
you to go and look at it in a second to

00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,809
work on out here what's that

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,920
so I ever thought that I forget it it's

00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,850
a very dumb application there's no

00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,600
sometimes it's working sometimes it's

00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,400
not working

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,530
I want to debug it but I think UI

00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,240
engineer said that's probably the right

00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,370
way there let's figure out what's going

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,650
on we decided to bring it all the way to

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,840
be here so this is an example this is

00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,400
like Visual Studio code and this is the

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,970
one of the service of this application

00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,920
it's a very simple goal service

00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:15,679
well went to the next is I'm basically

00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:18,020
going to use this just so basically it's

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,820
extension for each other as you do and

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,700
if you write X course you can actually

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,800
debug so what I'm clicking on this is

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,770
immediately going etc which namespace we

00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,610
wanted back so I'm going to say because

00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,650
that's got potential

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,600
they will double working copy of two

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,360
points which one can you want to debug

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,370
and I'm going to go into service and

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,260
anyone tell me well in service to you

00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,410
have to think you have the SD oxide time

00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,790
and you have got your service which one

00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,679
you want to debug let's go with the

00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,270
students and any secondly which debugger

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,240
do you want to attach them and that's

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,010
where you go so we'll go with needle and

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,360
that's basically what I do so you ask

00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,040
you some question about what I wanted to

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,950
do and in a second what you see is that

00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:02,170
it was submitted via the same and I'm

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,170
attached I can go right now easily

00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:13,339
the attention put some numbers in a week

00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:15,499
and I'm like a bug so that's pretty

00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:16,729
simple and this is helpful of course if

00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:18,409
you are more than one microservice you

00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:20,449
can attach it different like Francis a

00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:22,759
lot of the development a Java debugger

00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:25,099
they go together and the jumping beans

00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,619
will ensure your movement so that's a

00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:30,289
pretty simple and it's very successful

00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:32,839
courses but here's the problem the

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:34,489
problem is that and you know do it you

00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,179
can't use it in production this is a

00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:37,069
department

00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,619
no one is insane enough to take is

00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:41,509
Africa anybody empowerment and you know

00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:43,999
TT be an attached to their microscopes

00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:46,309
on the production so the question is how

00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:49,099
can we bring this easiness to production

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,659
and this is cluster of production and

00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,719
this is what happened right this is our

00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:55,609
universe bond you know you are bad for

00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:58,489
your vital services maybe they

00:32:55,609 --> 00:33:00,349
particularly debase if you want to know

00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:02,029
what's going on and now to speak today a

00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:04,159
lot of people people towing is they're

00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:05,809
basically using open calamity that's why

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,599
they were all the logs that exist to

00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:10,219
this application but here is the one to

00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,199
take all the Lots from all of this is

00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:14,389
very expensive so there is two

00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:17,179
limitation forward the limit of interest

00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:19,189
number one the only work to take the

00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:21,679
edges you can take the Bible it's too

00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:22,360
expensive you only stop spying on the

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,789
network

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,269
to take them the second thing simply

00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:30,399
simply is the part of also open to

00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:33,549
penetration you can take it off choose

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,590
right okay so that's optional so maybe

00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:38,019
service first we saw us this problem now

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,029
if you go to the side down and - exactly

00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:41,679
but actually it's not going to solve the

00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:43,539
phone it's exactly the same problem

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,159
right and the problem is that you still

00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:45,640
cannot take everything you can't take

00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,799
anything

00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,730
so it's let this thing go ahead and eat

00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:53,679
them why did everything I've only care

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,220
what they want that went wrong anyway so

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,769
what is between it I can be able to be

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,960
poured every truck all this traffic

00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:04,750
inside the course because I have a

00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,149
service so that mean also they response

00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,280
from the database from s3 everything

00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:11,619
that was in product now in the end of

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,330
the transaction everything is good and

00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,070
when they don't care about them just

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,580
passing it it's never going out so my

00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:20,619
god but it's not going to remember but

00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,330
if there is something wrong and

00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,520
something what should be defined by the

00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,859
user retaining the to do this there are

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,290
more save it I'm gonna set the body only

00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,149
set the area understand everything right

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,060
including the data that went for the

00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,530
interment everypony group right specific

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,640
order filtering it we please please

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,950
using it

00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,450
is something someone calling them

00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,890
because the list is not here they

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,050
clicking a button with the supporter

00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,760
basically reporting everything that

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,380
related to these specific user to let

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,280
their attorney to realize it that's

00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,010
exactly what we're doing

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,740
Luke can help you rerun it in sports so

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:56,890
again last they went to swim time and

00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:01,320
it's really quick so what what now I'm

00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:01,320
going to do is something very simple

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,160
okay so what we're going to do something

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,580
very very simple

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,550
we created a sea alive Lucy alive and

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:24,750
when you can use it if I'm looking and

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:24,750
I'm doing loop city always lose it

00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:35,750
so anyway I can show you out working be

00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:37,280
mistaken my bed didn't recorded that I

00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,410
was sure anything about basically what

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,790
we have is we have a supplication and

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,230
every time that something is F and

00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,030
everything is good is not doing anything

00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,710
and I'm sure that second that if

00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,930
something is wrong we basically

00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:51,440
recording it and that we can we played

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,670
it we attaching the debugger injecting

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,470
the information that happen in

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:58,160
production without happening to just

00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,270
basically everyone 30 seconds while this

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,160
happened I think it was a lot of

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:04,540
material so is it and that there is any

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,540
question and I can show you

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:17,949
[Applause]

00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:42,360
xlr8 so in production department that it

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,280
is no debugging oh that's too dangerous

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,290
oh no we're too attached but there is is

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,140
there is a tax filter that we extended

00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,600
in endpoint that basically we hoard all

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,340
this information and when the between is

00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,650
needed when there is catching something

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,740
because it's naturally what I asked for

00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:01,260
whatever response of 500 saving it

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,690
outside so now I have all the data that

00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,470
was in production I can spin up another

00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,990
provider

00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,580
I can attach the debugger and then I can

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,620
inject the data like that was in

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,990
production including what came from the

00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:16,850
database and it's so simple - it's

00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:19,860
pretty simple and I can show you that

00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:24,900
yeah okay so now it's better so you

00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:27,390
should just show you the demo so what

00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,250
you can see is basically that and look

00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,380
see yeah there's nothing there right

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,210
there's nothing important yet I did is

00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,890
be funny and out there is the

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,830
simplification that we talked about it

00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:40,530
before and basically it's working most

00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,060
of the diamonds - so before but

00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,500
something people saying that it is to

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,770
make something they're not there and I

00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,770
don't know

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:18,300
okay so that's working here

00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:20,400
what'd you say endemic okay so there's

00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:24,330
about intoxication so let's figure out

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,250
what what you will see is that now to

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,020
actually pitch he didn't catch all the

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,440
good ones right we did a few you didn't

00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,210
catch it

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,120
the only catch near one of the most 500

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:45,660
and now I can just go to here very

00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:53,310
simple attach the body like and the only

00:38:45,660 --> 00:39:00,480
thing we need to do I'm just need to

00:38:53,310 --> 00:39:04,770
come here and do look sit here weekly -

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,110
- ad and now basically what you see is

00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,900
that it's protecting you right and never

00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:13,110
lose a think the exactly again but he

00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:17,220
gave me the data the body product so now

00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:23,060
is it okay to ask so what you can see

00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:23,060
that I just feel their mr.eddy basically

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,670
so that's important but their Indian

00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,380
step now I can actually divide into that

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,790
so what I really want to do I don't care

00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,840
what they're asked and that's the beauty

00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,840
of the obstructionism

00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:05,130
all right cool so one of the issues that

00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:06,840
we have as far as soryo put it - it only

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,880
captures the bad things that happen

00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,340
let's say 20 nodes are involved in our

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,960
quest they all have state failures

00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,940
across three nodes and I actually the

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,160
transactions across all twenty an action

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,510
on the state from across all twenty if

00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,450
you're going to solve that problem

00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:24,720
yeah there's no state there is a state

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:26,790
to your application itself no but in

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,110
micro services they what else facto app

00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:33,060
hopefully you want to say that the state

00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:38,970
is like you know shared it's more like a

00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:41,580
saying because I'm undecided or I can

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,320
actually everything is going to me so I

00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,060
think honor that came to here and

00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,610
waiting is going and with that I'd get

00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,260
mine and what works you know and again

00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,000
what its bed is like it's oom that there

00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,920
is a biscuit arrow and make these works

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,660
are not respondents there's something

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,040
that's what we're saving all right

00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,110
because it's important to us and in the

00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,610
end we're making a decision but that's

00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:02,100
going to be a problem because I'm saying

00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,500
very little in the proxy and we are stop

00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:17,430
meant a lot of things like that the way

00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:18,990
you know what I think is this request

00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,960
coming to the no I don't know if it's

00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:24,540
Valyria or not it is funny we are stable

00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,850
over until the end is no such now that

00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,130
was actually finished be evaluated by

00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,470
the saying well you know in there is a

00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,960
problem with no three and taking all

00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,610
this all this huge reduction and a

00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,680
basically sending in the relative rerun

00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,050
so I have all this even when a

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,820
successful in this transaction but if

00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,820
all these different action is good

00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:52,770
yeah except thank you I think they've

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:55,230
time for one more and just take a very

00:41:52,770 --> 00:42:01,280
any boss that we are hired we can't

00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:01,280
actually so sure any other questions

00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:14,400
