Description: 
	Speakers: Anish Asthana, Sherard Griffin, and Daniel Wolf

As data is exponentially growing in organizations, there is an increasing need to consolidate silos of information into a single source of truth, a 'Data Lake' to feed hungry Analytics and Machine Learning Engines that can gather insight at scale. In this talk, we will provide an overview of the Open Data Hub architecture. Then we will highlight a current data science use case leveraging Red Hat OpenShift, Ceph Storage, and analytics with Spark and SKLearn on JupyterHub.
