Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Tomislav Mesic

No it's not about techno hit from the 90s and it's not about movie classic with the same name. It's about how to make superpower and intelligent Chatbot based on node.js, Azure Bot Framework, LUIS, Text Analytic Cognitive Service and some other stuff. Anyway ... totally crazy thing.

During this session we will build movie Bot from the ground using and combining several important components like Language Understanding, Text Analytics API and The Movie Database API. At the end, Bot will be hosted and published on Microsoft Azure platform.

welcome to this morning show does what

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,030
and coming from Croatia

00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,279
I'm sure if you know its creation but

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,669
it's really small country in the middle

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,509
of Europe actually it has only ten half

00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:27,029
million citizens there do you have it

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:29,329
will very costs and really great soccer

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,329
players

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:37,120
today we always speak about childhood

00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:41,489
development I'm not sure if you are

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,489
familiar with jet development at all

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,149
what you to us from the beginning

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,230
okay

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,359
so the name does but actually I mean

00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:02,199
nothing so there was early

00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,180
it is in the Europe of Technology or

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,899
dense mania under sure if you're aware

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,710
of that

00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:10,689
but during these days there was many any

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:15,220
popular technical products there in the

00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:18,970
Europe so one it was you 96 whose

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,080
Excellency from Germany they had two

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,210
great kids

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,789
number one is living these days one was

00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:29,920
the sport and second one was I want to

00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:32,770
be a candy during these days that was

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,360
really good kids so the reason why she

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,539
was named Osborn

00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,640
okay before we start with development I

00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,470
like to just put you in a contest to

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,740
better understand what I want to show

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:48,250
you actually today I was showing one one

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:52,049
Chad what which kind let's say we will

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:55,149
try to build during this session today

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:59,080
we're in Croatia I'm working for several

00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:01,390
companies from my own company a software

00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,140
development company for a five agency

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,989
which is one of number one mobile

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,720
development company in Asia which has

00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:14,879
the main office in New York City I work

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,180
for hotel also as a lecture on

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,910
University College Algebra

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,129
so it's a really small university but

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,760
for us it's important because we are

00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:30,909
private university and now it's which is

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,489
not very common actually in Croatia only

00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:37,209
few private universities are there and

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:45,250
we are number one actually I think ID

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:48,180
University hundred active students which

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:52,750
is not something for you in states in

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:55,750
Croatia who has actually seen half a

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,110
million US citizens there it is really

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,110
something

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,120
every new student we have actually the

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,320
more problems with the student service

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:13,740
like any other like any other university

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,740
so we need some how to solve that issue

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,990
possible possible solution is not to

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,920
hire more staff to the student service

00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,380
so other thing that we could do is let's

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,800
say we engineer processes internal

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,290
processes and make it go faster and more

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,340
fluent and then what we do we actually

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,550
discover

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,770
I mean discovered our research we

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:43,770
discovered at modern almost 80% of top

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,190
students issues easily solved actually

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,270
to some existing services which is not

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,790
connected anyhow so so the solution for

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,570
the issues actually exists is somewhere

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,570
inside

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,560
webpage social interest internal

00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:07,690
internet or something like that okay so

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:13,660
we decided to combine those services

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:15,790
make an API and make it optimized so the

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,459
solution one of the festival solution

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,280
for that is to build some kind of mobile

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:25,449
app or web app or something but we

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,639
decide to build a chat bot actually

00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:30,030
it was pretty nice it's still in

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,030
development

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,960
the concepts are actually here there's

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,820
three possibilities one is when students

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,940
need some basic information of the

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,070
contact info prices something like that

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,530
that's something that actually exists on

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,990
our website or in the summer so which

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,240
Edward should be able to go to that kind

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,250
of open sources grab those data

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,280
represent it to the user

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,830
second possibility is something which is

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,200
not open the source open to public

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,260
that's something which is our internal

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,300
let's say student homework student

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,580
pieces something like that although

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,810
Jesus should be digitalized with some

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,550
kind of knowledge base technology base

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,770
so the chatbot should be able to go to

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,560
that knowledge base and try to find the

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:25,410
answers there and the third one is

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,910
actually if there is no there is no

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,290
possibility to find the answer around

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,110
those two

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,980
saneras the first two scenarios then we

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:40,060
can go to internal staff or CRM and try

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:44,830
to best person the best person who can

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,870
solve our issue so let's say if I if I'm

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,030
doing my homework and stalking some I

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,250
don't know algorithm that I understand

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:55,660
I need the person or student or a

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:58,270
professor or whatever who can help and

00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,920
also here's some other things that we

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:08,440
can do the part of our system should be

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:11,110
able to bomb a book from library when I

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,230
have next exam or check my finances

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,800
which is also very important for private

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,800
university

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,860
Oh

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,460
maybe no who is this

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,789
Josie Maran from shared room and office

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,919
in three pics

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:35,270
whoever watched dream big

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:39,499
okay it is very famous sexually TV show

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,529
David Lynch TV show features in yeah

00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:46,009
during the early nineties anyway this is

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:49,490
Maureen he's a she she is secretary

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:52,580
Sherman and she's the one who should

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,639
actually solve any issues that she'll

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,789
termin has it like any other secretaries

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,770
so we choose her name Lucy for outside

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,770
one you know the tenant said what should

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,960
have some name okay so I was just

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,070
showing few scenarios how to chitchat

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,580
but

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,580
works

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:20,009
for a teacher what to be used for now

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,889
reuse the slack slack as a channel it

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:26,219
could be any kind of other channels like

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:29,789
Facebook Messenger sorry in Skype but it

00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:33,699
could be like messenger web chat

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:38,530
whatever okay so

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:41,889
I'll start injections Lucy it's me

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:45,400
and she offered me few shortcuts like an

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:48,610
analogy but that could I say this common

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,800
common things that the students need to

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,340
do with the channel I prepare something

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,340
more

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:06,380
I will just copy it will be easy then

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,960
typing so infrared you guy is our

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,750
student to digital service so sometimes

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,790
the team fight against black very common

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:20,840
reason was bloody because student

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:24,170
doesn't pay he would need to pay okay so

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,770
I will check I will ask Lucy to check my

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:30,560
finances if there are any issue my

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,800
finances maybe that has welcomed my in

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,800
Fred

00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:41,199
hello see go and try to my CRM okay I

00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:45,459
pay all my dues so there is probably

00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:48,399
another reason why why smoke but when

00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:50,649
along sho show you here that's loosely

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,649
recognized my intent that I want to

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:56,199
check my finances so she built the

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:59,079
branch of finances and check my finances

00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:01,470
I could do something complicated like

00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,470
this

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:14,550
so to go study abroad it's very popular

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,790
Erasmus program there in Europe for

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,769
student interchange but I need someone I

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,959
need someone who can help me with my

00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,959
with my enrollment process

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,590
okay so I need Salman okay yes let's go

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,530
to our internal stuff database and

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,720
trying to best image who can help me

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:41,920
with my enrollment process tourism sir

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
if we go to our

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:48,540
staff database we will see that

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,980
Christina actually is a Rasmus

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:56,790
coordinator so she's the only one here

00:09:51,980 --> 00:10:00,389
specialized coordinator process and

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,109
she's the one who is the first choice

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:06,629
for me so that's something which is easy

00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:09,230
it could be more complicated I could do

00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,230
something like this

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,860
so I am a student

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,939
and me and my pals

00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:25,999
you're doing some job in a year allah we

00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:27,409
are almost done with that so we need at

00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:30,919
this moment we need two marketing

00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:32,269
experts to help us push our product to

00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,970
the market let's say like that

00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:38,470
so presentation here to find two

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,470
marketing experts for us

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,429
again we'll go to an internal staff

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,429
database

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:51,850
and she find she found two marketing

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:55,910
experts for me so again if we go to

00:10:51,850 --> 00:11:00,490
start database yeah

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:05,960
so Natasha and Thomas love our marketing

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:09,470
guys okay so the reason why they come to

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:14,190
me as as a two choices but there is one

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:17,970
more Vanya my name is also marketing guy

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:21,779
why those - why not - minor well because

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:25,620
the one is not an expert so I asked for

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:27,449
two marketing experts so something that

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,279
I want to show you how those who can

00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:31,860
recognize my intense what I want to

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,430
actually grab the situation could be

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,579
even more complicated in situation like

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,579
this

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:46,670
so we're working on our project in our

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:50,070
lab but my teammates actually do nothing

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:53,190
so I'm pretty angry on them

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,380
I desperately need someone to help okay

00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:00,079
so again I need to make an expert but

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:05,490
I'm crazy on my teammates in this moment

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:08,759
elusive on me only one so you know that

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:11,430
we here in our database we share two

00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:15,389
marketing experts Natasha and promised

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:23,399
our marketing experts if you just you

00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:25,380
see a picture of tomislav here see if I

00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,459
am if I'm crazy

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:33,360
so maybe maybe two of us are not a good

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:36,750
combination that moment so if you take a

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:42,800
look of some database you will see the

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:46,310
TS internal HR or students or whatever

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,790
Thomas low number I mean the lowest

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,910
grade in the sentiment color so there's

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:56,040
the reason why

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,040
he didn't choose okay

00:12:56,319 --> 00:13:01,660
there's fewer things that I want to show

00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,949
in presentation what we discovered

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:09,519
during this process is that building

00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:12,069
bots it's actually pretty easy thing we

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,629
will see today in this presentation but

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,109
building in touch with one is pretty

00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,789
high

00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:18,669
you need to interconnect so many

00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:21,789
services it could be able to discover

00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:24,999
knowledge that you need from the IT

00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:26,499
solution perspective box here is usually

00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:29,169
just an interface it could be anything

00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:43,389
it could be webpage application

00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:44,990
application but I'm coming from

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,930
Microsoft

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,670
all of these both I will talking about

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,149
today and actually build some

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,810
open-source technologies everything in

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:58,760
yellow is actual options are just a few

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:02,620
services that we need consume are not

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,600
open source okay let's see how to build

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,680
about like this

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,680
I'll go step by step

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,340
just to make you familiar how to build a

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,990
boat from the beginning you'll

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,260
understand it's not it's not so hard

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:24,180
actually like it looks we have for four

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:27,900
or five steps okay so this boat is

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,450
building no Jess no Jess and everything

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,420
that we need for let's say hello well

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:37,010
what is a boat builder so if you go to

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,010
step one step one is

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:50,030
step one is great example

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:50,030
why does zooming as a customer okay

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:59,940
what we have here is to do two key

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:02,000
things or I'd say two key ingredients

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,439
for this

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,740
scenario one is the Builder builder is

00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:12,829
not package provided for Microsoft it's

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,660
open-source package it's convenient for

00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:18,019
any

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,779
chatbot based on Microsoft in your ears

00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:23,089
so they're in a really file you hear

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,819
actually few lines of code that you need

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:29,029
to copy and paste to your note to your

00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:31,310
JS page and you can start it on node.js

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,220
server and it's it you have a hello

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,470
world but our example is even simpler

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,130
than that

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,130
so if you check here

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,800
we need connector and we need the bond

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,389
those two things

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,600
everybody in this moment we will use

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:58,329
console character so everything what we

00:15:51,600 --> 00:16:00,639
will be doing in a council Chavez summer

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:04,019
in public and consume it to some

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,939
channels like this like skype etc

00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:09,089
producing purposes we can use comes up

00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:09,089
also

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:19,160
step one empathy so if I type anything

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:27,520
you will see here a right hand but I

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:31,570
mean that's wrong because we have only

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:34,330
one function here and so whatever you're

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,160
right so it's pretty stupid but but it

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:41,770
works it works

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:46,150
what's most important thing here to

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:50,770
remember is so every chat bot is built

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:54,340
on several 100 dialects like any web

00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:57,610
page web page website actually have many

00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,680
web pages the similar thing is in chat

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,230
bots so children could have many

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,920
dialogues for example either one

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:13,990
dialogue is order a pizza second album

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:15,940
could be choose what kind of pizza X

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,390
could be received something like that so

00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,920
those are dialogues engine but

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,459
we'll probably have more than one

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,589
dialogue this is hell around second

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:29,189
thing that I want you to learn from this

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,189
session now

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,930
is

00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,930
step two

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:42,220
so step two eventually always the same

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:47,670
equal like step one with one difference

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:51,530
we have two functions here in power dial

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,530
sorry Hut see

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,700
okay the first function will ask me

00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,700
what's my name

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,860
and he'll say help Thomas this is really

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,380
extremely important every dialogue every

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,600
dollar could have more than one function

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,870
in these functions array that's

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,110
something that we call okay

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:21,200
so why was because the output of one

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,140
first function will be input into

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,050
another and that's it so if you go to

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,830
other pizza

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:32,520
you can add many more many medians and

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:37,750
pizza so that could be a wonderful

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,580
actually inside of our survival is one

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,940
thing and what for is second thing that

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,990
you need to remember you said what

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:49,710
doesn't matter which technologies are

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,710
built work on the same same principle

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,650
is a step three

00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:02,570
this is this is something more

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:03,110
complicated I will not to explain

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,800
everything

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:09,140
why because everything besides building

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,790
robot is absolutely not important

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:15,110
I'm counted here and try to build maybe

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,920
recommendation button so I want to ask

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,220
my boat

00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,170
can you please recommend me one horror

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,420
movie from early nineties let's say

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:27,710
something like that in he will grab and

00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:31,940
turn me back my movie for that purpose

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:50,210
what we need is actually API or any

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:52,190
other service start sharing their

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:56,360
knowledge is the experience about movies

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:59,510
etc the we part here is they have open

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,590
source and free service to movies that's

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,360
something that we will use

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:10,400
it's nothing actually special

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:13,390
arrests series that we will use to grab

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:21,950
movies what's important here

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:24,530
we will need another module and you can

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:31,130
recognize something that we didn't have

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:35,150
before which is intense so the idea is

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,640
to move to bottom I recognize Mary and

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,780
my intent what I want to do here if I

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,880
ordering a pizza

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:44,150
he needs to recognize that I want to

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,210
order pizza if Y if I want to grab

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:50,300
information about movies I want that he

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,750
recognized my intense through to be able

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,210
move information about ok this thing

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,720
that you think that you need to know

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:04,570
about development so intense very

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:09,170
important body has several intense

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:11,870
hundreds will have at the end

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,780
I don't know how 200 maybe intense

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,240
possible test so if I want to check my

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,460
finance if I want to check my grades

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:25,340
that's also all different intense

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,340
okay so I shall

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:35,300
and in my dialogue with our memorized it

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,300
depends on the intent so if I here

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,840
nothing of this is not important if I

00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:44,719
check here intense moving

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,560
you'll know that you need to do

00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:50,740
something about movies

00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:56,910
and it's basically we have only one and

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,910
we have just one more which is which is

00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:06,250
default we have default one in make a

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:06,250
movie so in a situation on default

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:13,060
default intent humanize dialogue ask

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,100
name so you see if we have been several

00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,250
interns and several balance one of

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:23,890
elements ask for name second dollar

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:26,620
could be relevant and the last one will

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:30,780
be ask me for a year for which I want to

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,780
my movie so if I start my

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,210
but here

00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:43,780
now it's triggered default event default

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:47,320
intent okay

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:50,820
so if you asking me for name both my

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,820
name okay

00:22:51,300 --> 00:23:00,210
here we are he said okay I'm your one

00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:06,900
here only thing that he know actually is

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:09,600
movie intent so I need to write down so

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,720
my multiple recognize that it dint as a

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,860
movie now the movie intent is triggered

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:22,370
now it is our prom terrorized okay which

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:29,660
John we I don't know you want to action

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:29,660
conversation now it's rised year which

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,150
and here we are dragon heal the tree or

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,140
something I don't see

00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:45,420
okay so it's something that my what

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:49,540
recognize go to movie DB try to find one

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:54,010
action movie from itis

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:57,820
okay that's everything that we did until

00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:00,130
now we did in console the next step is

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,830
actually put it somewhere on some of the

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,720
clients like skyress like etc this

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:10,170
example for an X example we'll use the

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,170
same example but in the emulator

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:23,630
sauce that for example is equal like

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:26,420
step 3 it's only don't use console

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,640
connected but it's only actual

00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,860
difference and one more difference

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,880
we need the server for that we need to

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:38,240
use internal now Jess refer that it's

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:42,880
everything below is equal like mustard

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:47,650
tree so I will see if I first start my

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,650
tree Jess step 4

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:55,300
it will be rise on a server for three

00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:58,420
nine seven eight okay so what I need to

00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,300
do now actually my butt is now served on

00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,730
my local server if you know address of

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:07,380
my body you can access yeah you can

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,380
access them with your client

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,720
how does happens

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,979
I'm sure white zone so much

00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,590
okay I'll try to create it

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,350
every times happens with the live demos

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,640
just a second

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,039
No

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,300
I'm sure I saw so much

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,840
I'm sorry I can I can show that I cannot

00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,840
show that

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,820
sorry about that it doesn't work handle

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,250
it doesn't work you can go further

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:56,820
you need you just to believe me you can

00:26:50,250 --> 00:27:01,490
okay okay so what I want to show you

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:04,970
here with Jamie later is actually that

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,970
that's not good

00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:10,570
anyway it doesn't worry

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:14,049
so those things the same thing will

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:19,029
happens here in a console like an

00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:25,029
emulator like an my client as Skype

00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:29,440
reaction so last thing which means that

00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:33,459
we need to publish our bot to the Skype

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:38,019
okay or any other client services which

00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:41,019
can be used for that purpose for that

00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:43,989
purpose we can use several several

00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:49,359
actually scenarios but we will use Asia

00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:52,839
Asia component for for serving BOTS but

00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,639
before that why I like to show I'd like

00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,869
to show you an emulator but it doesn't

00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,869
work unfortunately

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,920
I don't care idea hug too

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:07,930
how to

00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,930
Summit's in or out

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,929
there's one more thing that I want to

00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:17,769
show you so our work is you May so here

00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:20,950
it's been through why because if I if I

00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:26,080
want to trigger very intense I need to

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:28,450
write down it's not good enough if you

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,399
saw here if you so here on my chest but

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,399
I could ask something like

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:40,120
I don't know what was there yeah

00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:43,110
centers like that so sorry the idea is

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,120
from sentence like that and that my

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:50,920
chatbot recognize my intent my intent

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:54,010
find me some person for me and recognize

00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,770
that I need to marketing experts okay

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:59,680
there's something that we need so to

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,930
trigger them like type just a movie then

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,420
ask for a genre then as for a year is

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:08,670
not good enough it could be better if I

00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,670
can go there and I ask her

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,750
I mean I don't

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,320
fremitus something like that that

00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:27,450
something that you want okay

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,940
it's also possible but for that we need

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,889
some kind of language understanding

00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,359
service there is a many language and

00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:41,220
same services in the world

00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:44,909
Google helps Facebook Microsoft also I

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:49,429
will copy it is sentence here is

00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:49,429
Microsoft language understanding service

00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:56,340
so if we just take a look on first page

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:59,330
of the rules you will see

00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,330
a few examples

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,740
let's say here flight to Cairo

00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,590
this is my first students from this

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:13,520
flight to Cairo

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:17,320
my body should recognize both flight the

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:22,190
flight intent okay it should recognize

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:25,240
to care okay that's two things so if you

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:30,110
press two this one example you will see

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:34,430
you will see that yes

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:38,840
flight intent recognized almost 100%

00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:41,300
sure okay okay but there is also more

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,080
intensity here I don't know booked

00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:48,890
flight non location finder etc that's

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:52,310
all in terms that we have but from these

00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:59,010
centers recognized that is that he need

00:30:52,310 --> 00:31:02,250
the flight intent he also recognized

00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:05,039
entity guider of location so we have two

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:10,530
things I don't know if you want to order

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:14,420
my piece order me to pieces here

00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:21,470
that is another former sound possession

00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:25,640
and also you recognize between 82 pieces

00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,860
that's something there is some sending

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,250
service could help us what we need here

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,160
is that we need a build a model for our

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:38,330
report we need the model and we need to

00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,700
train our module to become more workers

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:46,430
so if I go to my apps I have several of

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,430
them here but what we need here is movie

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:55,080
okay if I'm going to build that's what

00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:57,659
I'm doing so I can bestow several

00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,639
intense there could be a hundred dance

00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,179
it doesn't matter but before all what we

00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:11,340
need actually tree hello let's first

00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:14,519
start okay so if if nothing from my

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:18,240
sentences not recognize that none will

00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:22,350
be fired done intent will be fired if I

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,779
go to movie intent that's actually the

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:27,570
most interesting is he think here I have

00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:35,070
a bunch of utterances here some of them

00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:40,500
I roll out manually manually because our

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:43,800
but this model is you don't understand

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,170
anything so I need to train

00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:51,540
to do is put some uterus is there like

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:54,600
me sorry like give me three top rated

00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:58,049
movies from and I just

00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,919
I will just need to mark few things here

00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:05,580
so three is a number of practices sort

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:09,330
by the polarity and nineties is a time

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:14,330
that's something that I need to be

00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:17,580
returned to me from my movie I say here

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:24,840
can you suggest me a whole movie from

00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:28,470
last year so last year is a day time

00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:31,909
again so after the training you will see

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:36,539
here that all these uterus is pretty

00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:38,960
pretty sure that belongs to my movie my

00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,960
movie

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:49,940
okay so what I need might tend to turn

00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:54,350
me back those entities it's time is your

00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:58,790
number how many movies I need and sort

00:33:54,350 --> 00:34:02,840
let's say top rated that could be sorry

00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:06,150
so if I go here and test my model with

00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,119
the last you turns could use geometry

00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:11,450
horror movies from nineties and press

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,450
enter

00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:17,220
press inspector you will see here okay

00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,429
yeah it's a movie intent will be

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,429
triggered

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:27,409
it's three number from daytime okay you

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,300
understand

00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:33,200
so--but something actually did cover

00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,270
everything that I need so if I if I ask

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,250
my movie something my bought something

00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,110
like that if you are me this is

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,000
everything that I need to fetch the

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:47,060
movies from the movie DP okay that's

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,290
code we can I cannot show you there in

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:54,050
an emulator but I will just comment put

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:56,960
your comments here what you need to do

00:34:54,050 --> 00:35:00,200
remember for this purpose the only

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,560
difference before step 5 and step 4 is

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:09,200
that we need that we share here Louis

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,940
model model URL it's my URL from my

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,780
account

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,780
he'll sit here

00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,089
hurry up and point

00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,089
okay

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,529
I will use that end point here

00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:32,370
and I need to recognize is important

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,650
thing here

00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:38,880
those little measures could be several

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:43,700
tons of that I will use the voice and

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,900
then in my intense object I put all my

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,900
recognizes I could have more than one

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,840
recognizable and that's basically it's

00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,270
only difference here okay so my

00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:57,110
recognizer

00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:00,900
turn me back in 10th a movie or whatever

00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:04,320
based that I will go to another intense

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:08,280
and everything else is the same

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:12,110
on hello intent we can make a non intent

00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:19,830
we can move intent and one more is none

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:22,320
okay it's only difference okay so that

00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:28,410
the Chad what we should public the

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:31,500
summer well public is to Asia you can

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:34,080
host it anywhere wherever you have no

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:43,860
gesture even your local machine you can

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:46,860
host it easily you just need to okay but

00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:49,860
what you need is to register somewhere

00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,970
here but then you say it somewhere so

00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:56,790
you need to say okay my thought is

00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:59,310
hosted here okay and you can use it on

00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,480
slack on Skype or whatever that's

00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,790
something that we need

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,880
there is something that very needs of

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:09,740
Asia I will show you how to do that it's

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,740
also pretty simple say I think

00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,430
this measure count if you want to

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:19,190
register you here I think a year free

00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:20,510
account for every service there so if

00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:26,140
you want to play with that you have

00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:26,140
enough time to do that I will go to my

00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:36,740
more resources I have difficult

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:38,359
okay so here I have two things one is my

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,150
chat mode service

00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,780
that's my server where my judgment is

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:46,970
served and one thing is registration

00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:50,240
that's it this registration is really

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:52,730
important thing this registration I will

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,849
say where where's my body

00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:58,730
where's my blood served on this server

00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:03,460
okay I will give him a name and icon and

00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,460
the most important thing is to choose

00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:12,080
several channels by default you can use

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:14,720
it on the web chat that's by default you

00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,970
can then grab that code and put it on

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,190
every page my pleasure to one that's the

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,769
website second one without

00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:27,660
choose the Skype and you have several of

00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:30,329
them here so basically it could be

00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:33,089
covered a pretty pretty much of the

00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:36,650
channels possible chance it's a last one

00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:36,650
is telegin its last one

00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:45,599
okay I could test it in Arab here

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:49,770
so there's the same ripshit that you can

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:54,500
implement on your on your vibration so

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:59,109
if I ask my butt here the same sentence

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,109
like Jesus MA

00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,839
I'd say like this

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,470
okay and should we have

00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:15,580
my favorite one and some other

00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:20,990
poor moose from 1890

00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:28,790
okay so as you can see it works but I

00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:34,760
will show you how it looks we need to go

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:37,040
here in Asia and we need to you'll see

00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,770
now it's it's really really really

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,610
simple thing we need to add a new

00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:48,610
resource we choose that but

00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:52,900
okay press create

00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:54,730
only thing that we need is a name and

00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:58,350
technology it could be built it on

00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,350
c-sharp word no Jess

00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:11,560
hello everyone ok so you just need to go

00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:16,330
to our button and copy and paste and

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:19,570
copy copy and paste the code step 5

00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:23,520
and they sit there and so if another

00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,520
matter locally it will work

00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:34,610
that Korea will see that it is basically

00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:38,620
the same code like we have on our step 5

00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,620
so busy then

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:46,450
and I need to go to my boss again

00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,350

00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,320
and I have generals

00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:04,940
I will describe

00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:07,730
it will send me the link send one link

00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:10,490
if I send you the link right now you can

00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:13,260
add my bot to your selection

00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,930
if I press here

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:20,100
each will open my slacker and intro ed

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:22,310
my budget under slack this is the same

00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,310
one

00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,080
okay

00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:44,140
so it's the same what like we had on our

00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:47,200
test jet major and that's basically

00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:50,140
there's only few things that you should

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,130
remember first of them from this session

00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:56,560
today first of them these dialogues

00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:59,680
every gentleman should have more than

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,820
one dollar go inside of dialogues you

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,620
have many functions change in a

00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:08,190
waterfall

00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,190
it's another thing

00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:18,180
third thing is our intense I mean

00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:21,420
or intense yeah MJ but should have at

00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:24,270
least two or three intents like our if

00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:38,070
it specialized but that you have a less

00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:42,000
than I don't know ten intense there is a

00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:44,790
plenty of them on market that's case for

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,210
key things I want you to remember from

00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:52,200
today's session okay

00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:54,420
this my code is not any part of this

00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:59,700
code is not somewhere on the github but

00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:02,460
if any of you want to share want me to

00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:07,020
share with you that code you can contact

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:10,619
me on my Twitter account or my LinkedIn

00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:13,050
account I'll be glad to help you with a

00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:17,010
shed but development if you if you want

00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:19,530
to do that based on Microsoft Technology

00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:22,200
Microsoft bug frame

00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:25,880
that's it for me today if you have any

00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:30,819
questions feel free to ask an hour

00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,819
somewhere at the hole that's it

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,030
thank you

00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:44,990
my question

00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:49,309
Oh step 6 yeah do we need the emulator

00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:53,990
for that you saw that man I mean you it

00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:57,190
doesn't so here you can see that that my

00:43:53,990 --> 00:44:01,460
movie actually turned back to me only

00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:05,690
update like title like description and

00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:09,200
and and the link to the image right so

00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:13,910
the idea is to present it not like that

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:18,200
but like that like this okay so we have

00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:20,960
a hero card here and three three shaker

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,759
cards in carousel that's something which

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,280
is in step 6

00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:29,590
it's it's more about let's say

00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:34,930
chatbots desire

00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:39,070
I cannot emulate cousin doesn't have for

00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:41,520
some reason I wasn't seated anytime

00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:45,480
I don't know I don't even how to swim it

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,480
doesn't mean it was about

00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,340
okay

00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,340
