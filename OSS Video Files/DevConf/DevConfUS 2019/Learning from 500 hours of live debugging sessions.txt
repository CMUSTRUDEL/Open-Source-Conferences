Publication date: 2019-10-02

Description: 
	Speakers: Raghavendra Talur and John Mulligan

If knowing about a corner case in the software and documenting it is knowledge, then the awareness that most customers will not read that documentation is wisdom. In this talk, we present a list of things that we learned by spending hours and hours working with customers to debug and fix their systems.

Topics such as learning what should and shouldn't be automated, how to learn what customers really need from debugging tools, and the challenges of dictating a mid-sized bash-loop over the phone will be covered.
