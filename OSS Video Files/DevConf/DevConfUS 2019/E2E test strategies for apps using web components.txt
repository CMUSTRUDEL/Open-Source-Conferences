With most of the web apps starting to use common UI libraries and web components for reusability and modularity, the impact on brittleness of already fragile UI testing or E2E testing has increased. Imagine another set of developers changing an autosearch box which two of your web apps are using and impact this change can have on your E2E tests, selenium or otherwise which use dom for identifying locators. In this session we will be presenting a strategy which prevents this impact by UI testing the component at source and then reusing the test library in app specific e2e tests.
