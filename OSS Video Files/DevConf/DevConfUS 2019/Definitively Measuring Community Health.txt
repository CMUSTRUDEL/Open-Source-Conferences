Title: Definitively Measuring Community Health
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker, Brian Proffitt

Open source has matured to the point where community leaders must have concrete data and evidence on how a community is succeeding (or not), beyond just a "feeling." But, as Brian Proffitt will describe in this talk, data will not solve this problem alone. All the data in the world won't help you find answers if you don't know what the questions are.

Brian will provide clear and focused guidance on what the right questions can be for a community and how to obtain the data communities need to determine their health, based on his work as a governing board member of Project CHAOSS.

Attendees will learn how to ask community health questions and how to start finding the answers with actionable, practical steps.
