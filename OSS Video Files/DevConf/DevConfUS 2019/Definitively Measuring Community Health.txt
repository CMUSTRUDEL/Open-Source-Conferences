Title: Definitively Measuring Community Health
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speaker, Brian Proffitt

Open source has matured to the point where community leaders must have concrete data and evidence on how a community is succeeding (or not), beyond just a "feeling." But, as Brian Proffitt will describe in this talk, data will not solve this problem alone. All the data in the world won't help you find answers if you don't know what the questions are.

Brian will provide clear and focused guidance on what the right questions can be for a community and how to obtain the data communities need to determine their health, based on his work as a governing board member of Project CHAOSS.

Attendees will learn how to ask community health questions and how to start finding the answers with actionable, practical steps.

hello you haven't heard it yet settle

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,780
down so high as mentioned my name is

00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:16,810
Brian prophet I am a community architect

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,020
with the Red Hat open source program

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:24,730
office and our team's responsibility

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:26,980
there is to maintain the health and and

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:31,750
good standing of many of the upstream

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:34,450
projects with which Red Hat works in the

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,600
open source ecosystem that eventually

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,510
will become our products and as part of

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,199
that job one of the things that a lot of

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:48,539
us and our team does on a daily basis is

00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:51,579
try to determine exactly what determines

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,280
community health in the past this has

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,440
always been a process where we've gone

00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,479
by our gut feelings or our past

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,389
managerial experience so we've come

00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,979
through and we've said you know well

00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:05,140
based on my prior experience I believe

00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,509
that this is what you know a healthy

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,600
community should look like for the most

00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:12,909
part that is an effective strategy

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,009
however to standardize that and to

00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:18,189
quantify that and get actual numbers

00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:20,439
behind it then it becomes a much more

00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:22,439
interesting challenge and that's

00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:27,820
basically the the subject of our

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:31,000
discussion today so data is one of those

00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,390
things that can can make you out very

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,130
quickly like any kind of visual image if

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,009
you stare at that I think long enough

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:45,219
it'll freak you out a little bit I don't

00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:47,170
know if it's working okay so visual like

00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:50,859
human beings are basically we are

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:53,619
designed to be visual creatures almost

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:56,469
everything we do as a reaction is based

00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,869
on our sense of sight we recognize

00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:01,420
patterns because if we didn't we get

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,939
eaten by a tiger in the jungle we

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,740
recognize movement because again we

00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:08,350
would get eaten by a tiger in the jungle

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,599
or to flip it around we need to find

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,680
food that moves so we need to figure out

00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,940
you know quickly what is happening so

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,630
our brains are very much

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,300
wired towards visual input and because

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,210
of that when we quantify things by data

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:29,020
in a visual form sometimes it can kind

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,940
of throw you off so to give you an

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,700
example of nature of things that might

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:37,060
look really pretty but would also throw

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,270
you off let me introduce you to the blue

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,190
dragon and this is a wonderful looking

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,190
creature it is a three centimeter long

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,470
sea slug also known as a sea angel so

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,970
right away it's giving you a pretty good

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,980
vibe this is really pretty and

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,790
everything except for the fact that it

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:57,220
eats Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,690
right which sounds like a good thing for

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,620
those of us who have problems with

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,650
jellyfish however if that means it keeps

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,840
the venom from the jellyfish inside its

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,380
own body so if you touch this thing

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,270
welcome to neural paralysis it won't

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,220
kill a human but it won't really feel

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:20,739
well and this is pretty much how it eats

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,300
so again beautiful but harmful and then

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,410
we can of course forget the mantis

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,709
shrimp of song and story this is a

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:32,530
basically 15 to 30 centimeter long

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:35,020
crustacean which has the ability to see

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,820
more colors than any other animal the

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,720
human eye which I've mentioned before

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,739
has three color sensors within the human

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,820
eye

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:48,940
these guys have 16 they can actually see

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:53,140
colors that we can't even imagine let

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,570
alone visualize and and based on its

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,510
coloring you can see it pretty much

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,810
takes advantage of that what it can also

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,850
do this is the dairy part is those front

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,160
appendages there they can accelerate

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,970
them to the the velocity of a rifle

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,709
gunshot which will end up delivering

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,980
1,500 Newton's of force and that's

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:17,830
basically so fast that there's actually

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,220
a light reaction in the water called

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:24,130
cavitation which generates a burst of

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,010
light when they do their appendages like

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,260
that interesting sidenote you can't keep

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,740
these things in aquariums because they

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,700
will

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,790
till everything in the tank with them or

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:41,470
they will break the glass on the tank so

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:45,460
you know pretty but again deadly but

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:48,220
getting that back to how data is managed

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,970
and how it works we can we have a

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,970
problem as human beings of being faked

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,870
out by what we see we all come into a

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,990
conversation or a situation with our own

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,360
preconceptions that is normal that is

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,910
how we operate as human beings we come

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,920
in and my experience is different from

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,810
yours and yours and so forth and so on

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,740
so we all carry these predetermined

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:19,470
thoughts and reactions to what we see in

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:23,590
here and the the common cliche for this

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,360
in the English language is we see you

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,790
know not seeing the forest for the trees

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,480
we can either get to focus on the

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,380
minutiae and not see the big picture or

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,910
we see the big picture

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,590
and we don't realise that there's

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,830
something going on with the individual

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,200
trees okay this is a common problem that

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,250
we have as human beings this translates

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,380
over to data interpretation very quickly

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,460
because that is basically a visual

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,250
medium

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:55,450
we don't usually hear data we certainly

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:57,910
don't smell data we see it either as

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,310
charts of numbers or actual visual

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,430
graphs or something like that so to give

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,990
you an idea of how that works or let's

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,190
take a look at this this is actually a

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,070
couple years old

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:13,330
this is them the world's biggest data

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:15,940
breaches and hats from 2017 so it's a

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,120
couple years old and you look at this

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,130
and each circle represents you know

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,520
whether or not it was a breach or an

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:27,870
actual malicious hack based on the color

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,490
and then you know you have the different

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,740
organizations and the number of accounts

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:37,300
that were compromised by these

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:40,510
individual incidents and this picture

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,340
tells you quite a bit if you're a

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,350
security expert it tells you that

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,720
yeah I think I could get a job at

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,790
Marriott hotels you know because they

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,700
could well at least a couple years ago

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:55,100
they clearly need some help getting

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,110
their systems locked out if I look at

00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,300
this is like the average consumer who's

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,190
out on the internet every day I may

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,250
never want to leave my house again and

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:08,630
or use any kind of online account okay

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:11,330
both stories are valid for how you're

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:14,780
looking at this and what what

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:19,790
preconceptions or motives you have for

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,470
looking at this kind of data this is a

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,910
little bit closer to home now this is

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,560
unfortunately a little bit hard to see

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:45,140
on this particular slide but what we're

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:47,810
looking at here is just one piece of a

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,820
much larger dashboard that shows the

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,510
level of get commenced and get authors

00:07:49,820 --> 00:08:02,630
and there's traffic over there there's

00:07:53,510 --> 00:08:04,820
usually but generally what we're doing

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,970
here is we're looking at a cross-section

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,080
of activity within a very active

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:14,390
open-source community and this is

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:27,650
actually a tool that we and our

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:33,650
open-source office and we have this data

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:36,620
for about two years and we had a problem

00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,480
with this data because the problem was

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,250
it was basically like a fire hose of

00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:46,070
information we were we we were under the

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,880
misapprehension and I will say that I

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:52,410
was a big proponent of this

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:56,279
where if we had a way of seeing all the

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,980
data coming in and see the traffic and

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,470
we would be able to determine trends in

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,630
our community health based of what we

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,630
were seeing on dashboards like this

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,199
drill down in each one of these tiles

00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:17,250
and get very detailed information so

00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:19,920
problem solved right well know our

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,100
community people that myself included

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,230
were having trouble sort of determining

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,779
what was going on in our communities as

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,120
a general trend we were getting a fire

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,790
hose of information in and not really

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,389
being able to process it and do anything

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,880
with it I would say that the bailing was

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:41,160
pretty much on our side of the equation

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,990
I'm not here to tell you that what the

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,079
church here does and if the company

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,910
based out of Barcelona Spain they do a

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,810
great job with this kind of thing and it

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:55,170
might be useful for your community but I

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:59,160
think for our part it was not because we

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:02,430
weren't ready with the right frame of

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,009
mind to process the staff and what do I

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:10,139
mean by that

00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:13,199
so we determined very quickly that just

00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:16,769
having a big picture it's not

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:19,259
necessarily your best option we

00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:25,050
determined that we didn't really know

00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:27,870
what questions we needed to ask we just

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,319
thought we saw this data and it was

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,420
coming in that you know magically a

00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:36,449
light bulb would go off and everything

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,670
would just make perfect sense to us and

00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:40,949
that was really not the case because

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,920
what we learned is that we didn't even

00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:46,319
know what questions the house we didn't

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,170
we hadn't taken a step back and prepared

00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:51,170
ourselves to understand what

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,160
so if I throw this out and maybe my

00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,320
teammates refrain do you know where this

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,970
is going

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,460
let me ask you just throw this out there

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,180
and just jump in with a dancer what do

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,180
you think makes us mean to be healthy

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,180
what

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:23,940
you seem like a nice guy I probably go

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,670
in at five bucks so let's think about

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:46,380
let's narrow it down a little bit more

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:50,360
measurably what would you write right

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:55,830
yeah so commit diversity yeah so right

00:11:50,360 --> 00:12:04,950
anybody else I'll tell you one that

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:06,300
usually comes up right I know yeah some

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,540
of you already know the answer this some

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,760
of them oh now those are not necessarily

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,560
gonna be a good thing because Mozilla

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
and I always pick on them and I always

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,880
have to put in the caveat Mozilla it's

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,520
fine what I'm about to say is not true

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,440
in any way shape or form but Mozilla has

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,930
you know hundreds of thousands of

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,110
downloads every month or even every week

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,330
of their software so it would be

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,450
relatively straightforward assumption to

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,940
say well they are very healthy community

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,680
that is not the case for all we know and

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,720
there's not but for all we know there

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,230
could be this massive infighting going

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,520
on within women in Mozilla communities

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,810
having this argument there's about to be

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,490
a huge Fork okay we as consumers of the

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,410
of the debt of the software who are

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,630
downloading the software over and over

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,730
again we would not understand we would

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,520
not even know that we would just soon

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,260
falsely that the community was healthy

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,550
just by the number of downloads so

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,940
downloads is not really an accurate

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,940
measure

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,610
we're using and we hear that even as our

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:15,680
team we were having discussions about

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,600
this and moving forward and we had to

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,649
drill down into other questions like

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:26,270
what Ashley mentioned in Carson right

00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:31,520
yeah exactly

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:33,620
and that that is also a I fallen into

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:42,230
that trap a million times because yeah I

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:43,790
would say yeah if you ask me I would

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,120
probably put some tile at the top of the

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,860
list and I'm just guessing that based on

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,600
the fact that they seem to be relatively

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,550
successful in their releases and things

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,899
like that but again that's anecdotal

00:13:52,550 --> 00:14:00,440
that's not measuring so questions are

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:02,410
critical and we needed to figure out

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:08,110
what those questions were going to be

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:08,110
because once you have the good questions

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,040
repeatable we would have

00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:01,470
so that was step one step two then

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,589
became okay so what questions do we

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,959
house what do we you know what let's get

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,540
down to it we can all be high-minded and

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,980
things like that and figure out okay we

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,529
gotta ask question what are those

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:17,970
questions going to be because if I'm

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:20,429
working on say a five person development

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,889
team and we're building a really cool

00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:24,959
little security package that fits inside

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,790
of a larger project and that's my

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:32,089
community versus the community like say

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:35,459
OpenStack which is multiple

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:37,709
organizations and many hundreds of

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:42,660
developers working on different modules

00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:44,990
within OpenStack okay it seems like on

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,629
the surface the questions that would

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:50,610
apply to a five person team versus

00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:53,600
questions that would apply to a five

00:15:50,610 --> 00:16:05,819
thousand person development community

00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:08,639
with documentation facing over time

00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:14,100
because there was this notion that well

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:16,829
what applies to my community over here

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,529
we can't ask the same questions turns

00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:27,480
out that's not exactly true and the way

00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:30,779
to think about this is think about where

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,589
you live and you may live in a garden

00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,589
city like Boston

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:43,860
top of the mountain in Switzerland or

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:48,920
where in between they're all they're

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,920
both communities but obviously they have

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,680
how do you measure the same things well

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,589
even though they are vastly different

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,170
looking these communities share a lot

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:03,690
they all have to have some form of

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,459
transportation and the village of the

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,679
mountain in Switzerland it might be a

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,510
couple of dirt roads going in between

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,329
the houses in Boston

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,740
we got thoroughfares and streets and

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:18,510
expressways and subways and mass transit

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:22,140
but we still there things that get us

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:25,020
around city they both have to have a

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,510
water supply in the village it might be

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,940
a single well or multiple wells or

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,130
whatever you've got city like Boston

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,860
it's coming from a reservoir system

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,110
massive infrastructure coming in you

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,250
gave it we got it

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:43,860
okay but the questions are still saying

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:46,350
how getting water are you getting water

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,350
efficiently is that water clean and

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,419
drinkable the basic questions are the

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,610
safer the small community and

00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:57,330
Switzerland on the mountain and the big

00:17:53,610 --> 00:18:00,299
giant city in the US and again

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:05,220
everywhere else in between that's how

00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:07,320
you approach community and community

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,659
health you don't really care about the

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:18,540
size you don't really even care about

00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:21,030
how it gets done you care about okay I

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,840
don't care if it's tough the water is

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,580
coming from a well or 500 reservoirs out

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,440
in western mass

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:33,690
as long as water is coming to me so I

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,690
can get to it as needed

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,270
and that's how we sort of approach teas

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:50,860
and this is where we come into until we

00:18:49,330 --> 00:19:03,929
started really looking at data and

00:18:50,860 --> 00:19:03,929
starting to really ask anybody in the

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:41,080
well okay so we started asking what does

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,350
it take to make a community healthy and

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:50,710
there are a few core ideas here and

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:52,770
talked about as a big picture these are

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,860
the areas that make communities healthy

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:59,470
and that we are trying to examine both

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,910
with M Red Hat and within the project

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,570
I'll tell you about in a little bit

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:07,480
within the Linux Foundation so the first

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:12,100
one is evolution now evolution is

00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,660
actually a clever relabeling of what you

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,059
might be familiar with has a business

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,840
term the growth maturity and decline

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:23,140
model okay so you're looking at each

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,530
project what stage is that project in

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:28,720
because that stage or state if you want

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,520
to talk about developer or speech is

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,400
actually important to the rest of the

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,910
questions that you ask if I have say a

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,990
brand new project that has a governance

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,869
structure

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,179
a single benevolent dictator and a few

00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:45,730
other people working on the project well

00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:48,009
if it's brand-new that makes sense

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,360
you just got started it's just a bunch

00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,820
of people getting together and working

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,029
on something cool and new and they said

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,879
one person's gonna be in charge so that

00:20:55,029 --> 00:21:00,820
makes sense if that the same thing

00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:04,119
you've got five years later when you've

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,179
got hundreds of developers and still

00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:10,509
that one person in charge doing all of

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:13,869
you know oversee oversight and decision

00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:18,070
making that would be a mature project

00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:21,039
and maybe not really so much a very

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:24,429
healthy thing same governance different

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,879
states there's a problem okay and that's

00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:32,279
just one example so we look at evolution

00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:35,019
in terms of you know how is code develop

00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,580
the governance structure or the size or

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,740
even the age of the project although

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,869
those certain certainly come into play

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,509
so we're looking at things like code

00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:46,450
development so aspects of how the source

00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:48,999
code changes over time if more and more

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,519
developers are coming in have you

00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:53,350
adjusted your workflow to accommodate

00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,480
more developers or have you built

00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,129
bottlenecks into the system that really

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,490
should be gone because you're not

00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:02,590
scaling up properly the growth of the

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,559
community as I mentioned is a big thing

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,049
are you growing that's always good and

00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,710
then are you growing efficiently and

00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:14,139
adapting your processes to that growth

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:16,210
how do you resolve issues have you again

00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:18,090
that gets into that governance model is

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,970
it just one person doing all the

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:24,190
deciding or is it you know have you

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,230
accommodated and built like governance

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,019
boards or lor maintainer soar whatever

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:33,149
governance you decide to do these are

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:38,350
things that we talk about in evolution

00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:42,690
the second area is diversity diversity

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,619
is actually a few things what is the

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,539
standard way that we think about

00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:50,230
diversity and the technology industry

00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:52,450
today when we're applying it to race and

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,429
gender and religion and sexual

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,679
orientation and so forth and so forth

00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:59,020
these are all human based diversity

00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,720
things and they are all very important

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,130
the more diversity community is the more

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,309
we get back to what I was talking about

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,390
earlier where we all have these

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,220
subjective experiences that we're

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,340
bringing to the table and the more we

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,140
have differences in those experiences

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,330
there's a pretty solid argument that

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,000
says the more creative your solutions

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,919
are going to be but diversity also goes

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,400
a little bit beyond that into things

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:29,080
like corporate diversity if we have a

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,790
project of red hat that say has 88

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,520
percent of people involved in the

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:37,090
upstream project work for red hat is

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,360
that a good thing or a bad thing I mean

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,490
yeah well for red hat is great because I

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,169
just basically say oh we're gonna put in

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,669
these features and that's what's gonna

00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:48,790
happen and that's gonna show up in our

00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:50,679
downstream right so for us it sounds

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:54,520
like a pretty good deal but here's some

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:56,320
problem the other you know 12% they're

00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,760
gonna feel marginalized so left out

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,750
they're probably gonna leave eventually

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,750
and the other thing is new is gonna come

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,940
in somebody new comes in to my project

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,890
and says why would I want to contribute

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,299
to this project because red hat doesn't

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,299
like it they're just gonna turn it down

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,549
you know so that's a problem and we are

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,080
actually beyond that pragmatism you know

00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:26,169
I should emphasize we are big believers

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,559
and having a lot of diversity some of

00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:37,210
our most successful projects are

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:39,220
projects Fedora which I don't know if

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:43,110
everyone's familiar familiar with it

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,110
Fedora is the upstream project

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,450
which is probably one of our most key

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,370
products that we have it's the platform

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,760
from which most of our other products

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:57,060
are built from but know we're on the

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:03,270
last time we did a survey is somewhere

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:06,210
around 30% for Dora contributors work

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,730
for Red Hat which surprises people

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:12,120
because again I just said it was one of

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:14,990
the key projects that we have I mean

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,260
that things got to be healthy because

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,910
almost everything else would you only

00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,910
thirty percent of the people actually

00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:26,190
work for Red Hat and that's great

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,320
because the other 70 percent are in

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:35,580
there working on the same kinds of code

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:38,550
and they're outside of fedora

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:43,310
so fedora is a classically great example

00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,310
of how corporate diversity should work

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,710
sorry I lost my mouse here a little bit

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,150
other things that we talk about when we

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,070
talk about diversity not just the bodies

00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,450
that are inside the community but we're

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,570
also talking about what it's a

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,830
leadership diversity is it always the

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,830
same people in charge

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,740
human beings are habit for me we love to

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,520
have the same people around us all the

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:25,260
time people we want to continue to work

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:28,170
well with other people inside that to

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,670
get new ideas and new leadership so what

00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,310
is your leadership diversity

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,380
what is your governance diversity do we

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:37,460
recognize good work these are all

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,460
diversity questions

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,370
you know what's the path for that person

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,990
to become a maintainer or a member of

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,330
the technical action committee or

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,419
whatever your governance model is is

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:54,100
there a promotion half you know and is

00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:57,820
that promotion path the same for

00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:02,380
everybody and that's some of the

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:06,640
questions we asked around diversity the

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:09,370
next one is value now value this one's a

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,039
little tricky because I've actually had

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:25,240
I've done a presentation like this for

00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:33,490
an academic conference where we're doing

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:35,529
things for scientific value but the

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,380
value question still remains

00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:41,200
because whether I'm getting my value

00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:47,019
from how much money am I putting in a

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:52,720
project and what's my code out of it

00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:54,460
that is certainly a value question how

00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:06,490
much money am I getting from my grant

00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:08,110
and am I getting so value you know it's

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,200
a little bit different with academic

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:13,210
academia but it's it's not really a

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,929
straight-up profit and loss spreadsheet

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:20,769
but there is still valid value questions

00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:23,080
to ask what is the value of the project

00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:27,190
itself which I mentioned earlier what is

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,679
the project what is the value of you

00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,440
know how much of the work do I do out in

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,419
the community and it's done by

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,730
volunteers away from my company

00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:38,679
you know that's worth something that's

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,320
what's the time that I when I take that

00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,330
and make a downstream product that I

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,600
have to worry about Q&A and things like

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:51,020
that so there's value there there's

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,090
ecosystem value if my project died

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,000
ro what would happen to the rest of the

00:28:53,090 --> 00:29:00,170
open certain ecosystem the classic

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,660
example of that was SSL because it had a

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:07,900
major vulnerability a few years back and

00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,900
a lot of software are using since ISO

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:17,810
uses that software as part of their

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:20,900
security package one project failed then

00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,500
a lot of other ones would suffer because

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,100
of it

00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:32,300
so there's value in the software itself

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:44,480
beyond just monetary value and then we

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:47,090
have risk risk is probably I just

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:55,400
mentioned the value proposition of a

00:29:47,090 --> 00:30:09,740
project that project dies it has value

00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:13,430
because becomes a problem what is the

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,440
risk of this project one of the classic

00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,060
examples of this and you probably have

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:27,140
heard a variation of the scene before

00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:30,430
it's called the bus factor when the

00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,430
Linux kernel

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,500
it's by a bus okay

00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,270
and at the time people were like oh my

00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,980
gosh this is that would be the most

00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,950
terrible thing ever and millions of

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:57,220
dollars would be lost that was never

00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:59,350
true because we must learn pretty pretty

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,650
early on that even though she maintains

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:05,980
that benevolent dictator model for the

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:08,380
Linux kernel she has enough maintainer

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,250
x' they could basically pick up the

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:15,430
slack so if he were hit by a bus the

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,590
aforementioned OpenSSL which only had I

00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:20,230
think at the time of its vulnerability

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:24,160
there was only one person working on it

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:28,240
that was a terrible bus factor if he got

00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:31,570
hit by a bus then you know that would be

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,300
catastrophic for that project so when we

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:39,430
say projects have a bus factor of 1 or a

00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:50,650
low number and by the way the nonviolent

00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:52,810
version of somebody wins lotteries

00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,540
you're like see ya and we're out the

00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:59,020
door you know not that I would ever do

00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:04,060
that but exactly you know Tahiti is

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:05,830
wonderful so but that is a risk what

00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,900
happens if somebody leaves somebody has

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,360
to change jobs they move to another city

00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,040
their spouse moves and they can't do

00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,580
what they're doing these are things that

00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,460
involve risk other kinds of risks entail

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,430
code quality if you don't have a good

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:24,460
code checking infrastructure and you

00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:27,670
don't have a good QA and testing process

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,400
in place more bugs get into the equation

00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:35,100
you have risk of software failure and

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:38,290
also you know a public distrust of your

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:43,320
product and possibly your community as

00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:47,170
well transparency is another thing

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:51,120
transparency and not doing

00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:54,300
is a rest if you keep things closed and

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,370
decisions are made behind closed doors

00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:00,010
but then you run the risk of alienating

00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,230
the rest of your community I have to

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:05,730
give you an example of like how easy

00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:08,350
these things are to fall into the trap

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,930
the transparence and what is always a

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:18,640
great one for me to do because I've done

00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:25,300
this a hundred times where or in code

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:27,430
somewhere and maybe you're working in a

00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,950
physical and office or maybe you're

00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,530
working in a virtual office but you turn

00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:35,050
to your neighbor whether they're right

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,970
there next to you or you know on the

00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:42,250
other side of the video call or how are

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:44,920
you and you say hey hey I've got this

00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,230
problem can you take a look at this and

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,790
see what's going on and they look at it

00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,270
and they're like oh yeah I know how to

00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,270
fix it

00:33:52,450 --> 00:34:01,150
you fixed it you submit the patch all as

00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:04,470
well what's wrong with that picture in

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,470
terms of transparency

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,669
well I mean nine times out of ten really

00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:11,260
nothing because it's usually a pretty

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:14,710
small face and it's in there but that

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:18,040
was not a transparent thing two people

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:20,619
had a psychic communication probably not

00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,950
on the public mailing list or public IRC

00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:26,369
channel or wherever the community's

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:30,070
working they had a side conversation

00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:33,399
took two seconds what's wrong with this

00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:37,300
oh this is wrong it's fine but that's

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:40,780
not transparent and over time that kind

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:44,500
of habit that we've all done can trip

00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:46,450
you up so this is why we even with a red

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:54,250
hat we have to constantly remind

00:34:46,450 --> 00:35:00,310
ourselves right that is a really key

00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:15,550
message or the proposition of risk and

00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:20,550
if finally everything else so these are

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:20,550
all the five different organizational

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:42,310
and that is it's a project of the Linux

00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:44,650
Foundation and what project Kaos does is

00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:47,290
we are building metrics around those

00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,820
five areas so before I get into that a

00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:58,540
little bit let me talk to you about what

00:35:48,820 --> 00:36:02,760
common means and this is actually I work

00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,760
on is the organizational affiliation

00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,960
and it's one of those that actually sort

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,390
of applies to all the four other groups

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,790
which was why we sort of put it out in

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,120
common because it it breached a lot of

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:22,460
the different organism a lot of the

00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,680
different groups organizational

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,570
affiliation as I mentioned is basically

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,580
around the question of how many

00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,090
organizations are working in any given

00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:34,220
an open-source project at any given time

00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:36,170
what's the percentage how many are

00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,770
actually committing how many are

00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:42,830
actually approving commence how many

00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:45,080
people are on the governance boards and

00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:48,440
from how many different companies and

00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:54,740
the bleep is the more diverse those

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:57,890
elements are so this is where we get

00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:00,290
into we also talk about geography which

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:05,420
sort of bridges over to diversity but

00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:08,000
where are our that's a big kind of big

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,980
deal if a lot of your contributors are

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,690
in Europe they've got certain work

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,390
patterns that they're gonna follow they

00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:20,030
get you know bigger vacations and way

00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:22,910
more than Americans do because those are

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,370
key differences in culture and and work

00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:29,410
at it we're gonna show up and are

00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:33,860
important to any open source project and

00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:37,970
and then responsiveness how quickly does

00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:41,510
a project respond to problems in

00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:44,420
situations again now sorta bridges a lot

00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:49,600
of different or areas so we've thrown it

00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,600
out into the Commons

00:37:51,420 --> 00:38:02,460
and what project chaos is done and the

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:05,069
website is chaos against chaos dot

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,200
community and I invite you to go out

00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:10,890
there because what Kass is doing is

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,099
we're actually releasing metrics in all

00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:22,980
five of these groups we just released

00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:26,220
our first series of metrics and we

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,799
actually have released a series of

00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:38,640
metrics around organizational

00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:52,140
affiliation so figure out what are the

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:58,710
questions not it's not just a

00:38:52,140 --> 00:39:02,009
theoretical discussion on the software

00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:09,089
side software companies like butchers

00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:09,269
yeah and there's Kimmel thank you thank

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,329
you

00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:16,980
so Apache kibble those are two projects

00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:20,400
I can name off the top of my head so

00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:29,400
that do metrics analysis of communities

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:31,680
so patrulla and kibble veterans and now

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,380
as community managers and community

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,100
leaders are four interested in community

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:47,060
health we can analyze every community

00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:49,190
based on these standard metrics and an

00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:56,350
important part of what project Kaos is

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:56,350
doing so with that they did okay on time

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:07,880
yeah yeah I believe we have five minutes

00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:10,310
left in the session for questions if you

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,900
could try to stay behind the podium so

00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,340
that we can record them and I can bring

00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:20,990
the microphone around to anyone who

00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:23,870
raises their hand I think it's gonna

00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:30,650
sound like a funny question but so you

00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:33,290
you did thank you all day so you did

00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:36,980
mention as part of community health

00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:38,780
under diversity that that you do look at

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,060
the amount of say Red Hatters in the

00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,350
community let you know of the people

00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,300
that make up the contributions here how

00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:50,000
many are employed by us does that factor

00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:52,130
in the risk yeah I mean it can factor in

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,930
the risk I mean if we're a company like

00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,390
Red Hat we're not gonna probably

00:40:53,930 --> 00:41:00,140
disappear overnight

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:02,740
but if you were a smaller company and

00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:06,260
you are like say a start-up somewhere

00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:10,070
and you had like maybe ten active

00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,970
contributors to a project of forty

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:16,280
people if that startup were to fail

00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:19,280
suddenly that's 25% of the active

00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,050
contributors who are now under some kind

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,690
of stress I mean they're probably not

00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,700
going to disappear but they may have to

00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,410
change jobs and their priorities may

00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,580
change and suddenly they may not be as

00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:34,400
active as before so yes organizational

00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:37,640
diversity can run into risk in that

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,770
respect I think for Red Hat specifically

00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:46,010
to answer your question I think it

00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:50,280
becomes a risk factor in terms of like

00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:51,570
being it gets into that whole value

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,110
and this is where it gets a little

00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:58,170
overlapping but people sometimes don't

00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:00,060
see value and open open source projects

00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:04,290
that are dominated by single vendors

00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:06,960
they tend to be wary of them not always

00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:10,200
I mean Guk Google launched kubernetes

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,510
and all hands are jumping in on that

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:16,290
it's crazy town over there you know and

00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:18,030
Rackspace did OpenStack and that took

00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,240
off and went very well

00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:23,100
but sometimes that doesn't work so it is

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:27,000
kind of a risk factor because now you've

00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:29,100
got risk involved in how will my

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,140
community's growth be limited by the

00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:36,570
fact that I'm dominated by a single

00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:38,930
vendor and which is why we try to

00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,930
encourage

00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:51,550
the two-minute questions so and because

00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:55,180
I recall in your talk you also mentioned

00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:57,040
the risk to the communities of like if

00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,650
right out of dominant company came in

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,630
and made a decision that was you know

00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,670
manage you know domme domineering

00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,900
basically so those kinds of things not

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,700
being healthy to the community can you

00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,080
speak of some of the way like we know

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,760
why it's why it's important to right

00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,570
after the community is healthy in and of

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,570
itself regardless of does that make

00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,580
sense well I mean obviously when our

00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:23,440
communities healthy because we want I

00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:25,570
mean from a business side obviously the

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,250
healthier community is more efficient it

00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,260
is somewhat less money we have to put

00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,680
into it and it's better for our bottom

00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,590
line

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,250
so that's the the strictly mercantil

00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:37,900
mercenary part of it but also like as a

00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,610
culture within our company and a lot of

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,980
other companies that are invested in

00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:45,910
open-source having a healthy community

00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:52,000
just makes life better for everybody I

00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:55,720
mean so that's I I you know it is you

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,450
can have a vendor dominated project and

00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,110
still have a healthy community but I do

00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,850
think that it is important that you be

00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,850
cognizant of it and try to be working

00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,680
towards more diversity as you move

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,270
through it because we have a lot of

00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,780
projects in Red Hat that I would call

00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:17,440
healthy even though we are dominating

00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:19,870
them as a vendor but if they stayed that

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,210
way like if they were that way in two

00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,160
years or three years down the line then

00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,170
I would start having problems and that's

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,360
what we're doing in our in the open

00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,910
source program office we we look at

00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:33,520
these projects we audit them for these

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:35,590
things and as we build the metrics and

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,260
apply more standards and we start

00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,570
building a data set over time I think

00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,030
we're going to be able to come up with

00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:47,200
definitive answers to the questions that

00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:47,920
we're now asking right I think we're at

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,600
time

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,520
Brian are you open to more questions

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,410
outside the room afterward if you can

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,390
touch me I actually have to head for the

00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,039
airport but I do have a few minutes for

00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:00,029
questions outside so that would be great

00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,029
thank you

00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,590
[Applause]
