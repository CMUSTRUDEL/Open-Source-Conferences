Title: IoT Sensor Networks for Environmental Monitoring
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speakers: Grace Chin, Charlie Mirabile, and Joel Savitz

This presentation describes the development of a wireless sensor network system which automatically and continuously obtains and publishes sensor data in real-time. The system is modular and flexible in that it is applicable to a wide range of sensor types and numbers of sensor nodes.

At each sensor node, data obtained from sensors are read into an Arduino radio device. All node radio devices transmit their data to a base radio device, which is located at the base station. At the base station, the data are received by a Raspberry Pi computer, which is connected to the internet. The data are subsequently published to iSENSE, a web-based platform that allows researchers to not only quickly visualize the data but also to export the data for further processing using MATLAB.

yeah that was an issue with IOT and

00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:11,210
battery supplies and unexpected

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,150
last-minute complications which of

00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:21,529
course there are many so welcome to our

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:25,599
talk finally thank you for coming to the

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:29,599
conference auditorium present my friends

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,059
Joel savages Croatian and Charlie

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:39,740
monopolies IOT for environmental

00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:41,330
monitoring enjoy the top ok thank you

00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,520
not done for that excellent introduction

00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,790
now of course our first slide is going

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,490
to be an introduction so welcome to IOT

00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,710
for environmental monitoring maybe we

00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,690
should have called it IOT for climate

00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,570
change or climate science but it's too

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,160
late you already had it on schedule so

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,880
we have my name is Joel sabbaths

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,250
I am an intern on the Red Hat Enterprise

00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,200
Linux kernel generalist development team

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,659
and not a registered and a graduate

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,220
student at UMass Lowell I don't look

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,770
like the guy in the picture because I am

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,970
dressed for work in my finest

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:21,120
development flip-flops and

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,950
I previously worked in dr. Fred Martens

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,080
engaging computer group laboratory where

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,300
this project is being developed so my

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,430
name is Christian I also previously

00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,470
worked at engaging competing group

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,920
that's where I got involved in this

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,860
project but currently I'm a co-op intern

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,980
at Red Hat and I'm gonna let Charlie

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,110
introduce himself hi I'm charlie

00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,310
I'm currently much little student and

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,050
I'm currently working at the engaging

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,650
computing group where this project is

00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,200
being developed and so I am the lead

00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,540
developer and likely technical technical

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,760
lead for the development on this project

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,760
excited ease talk to prospective Joel

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,100
alright so this project began as a

00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,479
collaboration between two professors

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,240
kind of an interdisciplinary sort of

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,090
thing what one James heists a recent

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,860
addition to UMass Lowell a new professor

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,940
in the Department of Environmental Earth

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,600
and Atmospheric Sciences

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,820
it's his hypothesis that's being tested

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,560
using sensor networks we're going to

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,680
talk about in collaboration with

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,989
Professor Fred Martin a longtime

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,390
professor of computer science and the

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,910
recently promoted due to the associate

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,500
dean for student success at the Kennedy

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,540
College of Sciences and of course he is

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,090
the director of the engaging compute

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,850
computing group research lab where this

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,780
projects be developed and so this

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,209
originally began where the Fred Martin

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,290
has a research lab with a bunch of

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:58,260
students and he we had recently finished

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,700
some similar projects some IT related

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,100
projects and I guess they've been

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,160
talking and they decided to sort of loan

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,770
us to James heists and that's how this

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,680
project got started

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,750
so this is the right talk for you if you

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
are interested in a couple of different

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,700
things first of all the climate in

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,190
understanding the way the climate works

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,170
the way that we can model it and how we

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,760
can understand it and the way it's

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:28,040
changing in order to actually be able to

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,270
adapt and react appropriately as if we

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,940
don't really know what's going on we

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:35,210
can't even make any decisions on what to

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:38,330
do of course it's about the Internet of

00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,400
Things it's a toxic old IOT Internet of

00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,010
Things actually made the text wrap way

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,540
too weirdly so it's we just use no but

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,370
of course you know they're really just a

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,830
bunch of little devices connected to the

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,450
Internet that rely on you know power and

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,630
standard things but it's a very nice

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,590
buzzword so we use it and of course

00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,730
research testing hypotheses I mean

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,390
nothing particularly novel about that

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:06,500
except that we're undergraduates so it's

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:08,540
you know interesting and of course human

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,160
survival I mean usually originally we're

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,600
gonna say saving the earth but then of

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,070
course you realize you know it doesn't

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,110
really matter what we do to the climate

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,549
the earth will be just fine it's human

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,450
survival that we actually have to be

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:22,910
concerned about so in this talk we are

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,260
gonna present you with a an Arduino

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,810
sensor network with a couple of very

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,400
important features first of all that

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,590
it's open source of course is that is

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,540
the main theme of this talk and this

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,960
whole Mehlman conference

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,120
in order to provide the world with the

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,710
greatest inspect ability and make our

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,770
project of the greatest used to the

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,690
greatest number of people we publish all

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,830
of our source code and all of our ideas

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:52,160
online in public with as much

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,310
documentation as possible of course and

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,900
at the same time that's kind of open

00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,180
source in the software side to provide

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,530
similar levels of functionality on the

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,020
hardware side we aim to make it as

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:11,870
low-cost as possible by using chips that

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:14,300
are low cost so at the same time I

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,980
wanted to keep it extremely scalable so

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,990
that you could have you know one data

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,110
collection node or you could have you

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,880
know like 100 or so issue data

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,770
collection nodes I mean we're gonna say

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,330
like any number but you know within

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,250
reason pretty pretty large number of

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,050
nodes and of course we wanted to keep it

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,100
flexible so you can use all sorts of

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,170
different sensors and different

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,710
combinations depending on your precision

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,850
needs depending on your power needs you

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,460
know I'm just depending on what kind of

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,200
metrics you want to gather so now I'll

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,660
just give a brief overview of what we're

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,070
gonna talk about first we're gonna give

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,680
you some background on the science

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,180
behind this project and the original

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,010
motivations then we'll give you an

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,830
overview of our hardware and the general

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,180
architecture of the project then we'll

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,100
talk about some of our challenges that

00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,840
we that we currently face have the

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,750
problems that we're currently trying to

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,030
overcome then we'll talk about our MVP

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,530
or Minimum Viable Product the system

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,020
that we've been able to construct thus

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,060
far and then we'll talk about some of

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,320
the related work similar systems that

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,210
have done similar things for third we

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,700
knows for slightly different purposes

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,960
with slightly different features I think

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,880
we think our

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,070
lacking in a couple things we're gonna

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,350
present about and then we'll discuss our

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,970
next steps what we plan to do with the

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,979
system in terms of testing and

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,840
deployment and finally we will conclude

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,030
with a brief demonstration of our

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,310
Minimum Viable Product as it stands

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,500
today so without further ado I'll pass

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,850
it off to grace who will give you some

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,850
overview of the scientific background

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:50,860
so as we probably all know by now the

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:53,620
earth has gone has undergone concerning

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,390
climate changes over the past few

00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:01,090
decades and these have been determined

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,300
by scientists to be caused by human

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,460
activity and therefore it's in our best

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,600
interest to take appropriate action

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,910
because as Joel alluded to if we want to

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,500
have a chance of surviving as a species

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:19,410
then we need to make some changes and in

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,750
order to make those changes we need to

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,990
understand what exactly is happening to

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:29,170
our oceans wildlife beaches agricultural

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,520
systems and more all of the things that

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,520
you see on the screen right now are

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,670
related with one another so if anything

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,180
bad happens to one of them then they all

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:44,080
suffer and ultimately will lose access

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,090
to resources that we need so in this

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,180
particular project our focus is on

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:52,270
understanding beach aquifers and an

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,640
aquifer is basically an underground

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,670
layer of rock which contains in

00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,540
transmits water as you can see in the

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:05,050
picture and so now I want to talk to you

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,890
about some thing called eutrophication

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,370
it's a problem that we should all care

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,380
about

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,590
the problem arises when there is an

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:19,360
excess of nutrients from farming that

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:23,120
leached into the oceans via groundwater

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,000
an excess of nutrients can lead to an

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:32,479
overgrowth of algae which can block

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,090
sunlight and cause plants to not have

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,200
access to sunlight and to die and when

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:41,690
the plants die the bacteria digests

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,720
these plants and use up the remaining

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:49,310
oxygen in the water and replace it with

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,700
carbon dioxide and this causes fish and

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:57,850
wildlife to become unhealthy and to die

00:08:52,700 --> 00:09:01,480
without oxygen to breathe and so

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,980
obviously this is a problem and it has

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,740
adverse health effects for our

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:11,270
ecosystems and so one way that we want

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:13,640
to understand this problem is by keeping

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:19,000
track of the amount of dissolved oxygen

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:24,310
in the water and so we can see how

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,310
severe severely you tube

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:38,700
it's really the water is and then we can

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,100
make appropriate changes to fix that but

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,540
not just dissolved oxygen is what we're

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:48,770
interested in we also want to keep track

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:51,170
of things like pH temperature pressure

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:54,780
oxidation reduction potential which is

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:59,730
basically a measure of how chemically

00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:01,350
reactive the water is and electrical

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:07,410
conductivity which is the salt content

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:09,890
in the water and so we can form these

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:14,940
two fundamental research questions and

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:18,630
they are on the geosciences side what

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,790
happens to groundwater during extreme

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,810
weather conditions such as storm surge

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:28,080
and intensified wave wave conditions

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:30,960
like what what is gonna change and the

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,540
metrics that we're studying and for the

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,690
engineering side of the question how do

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,880
we develop a low-cost modular sensor

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,980
network that collects the required data

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,740
to answer this question and so in the

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,230
next slide charlie is going to present a

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,330
solution for the engineering side of the

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,820
question

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,590
great oh this is an overview of the

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,060
sensor network that we are constructing

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,560
this is a diagram of what we have going

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:02,650
on here in this picture we can see the

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,860
representation of two nodes and a base

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,360
station this is an arbitrary number that

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,030
could be different different numbers of

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,410
nodes the idea is these nodes are

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,850
self-contained units that are out in the

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,440
field that have sensors that are

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,180
collecting the data and they can use

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,240
their radio communications to bring that

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,640
data back to the base station where it

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,160
can be processed and uploaded to the

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,210
internet for for scientists to look at

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,010
and to really highlight some of the

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,130
flexibility of this network I want to

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,170
zoom in on one particular node here and

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,640
if I label these sensors I could label

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,500
them all being for temperature sensors

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,880
but the idea here with this network is

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,760
that that's kind of an arbitrary choice

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,870
just as easily these could be

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,450
temperature and half oxidation reduction

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,500
potential or three of them could be

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,270
conductivity and one could be

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,850
temperature doesn't even to be for

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,750
sensors the idea here is that we can use

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,430
whatever sensors within reason whatever

00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,630
metrics or need to be collected we can

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,030
use the right sensors to figure out

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,860
what's going on in the groundwater and

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,110
we can use the right number of nodes and

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,370
the right positions etc to figure that

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,990
question out in the way that's that's

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,990
most effective and that's really the the

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,310
flexibility that our system offers now

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,930
to start talking about some hardware

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,280
we're using to do this I'll go back to

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,740
this picture here this is kind of like

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,870
the first picture we had but we're using

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,100
the pictures of the actual devices so we

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,540
can see the base station there is a

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,830
microcontroller connected to a computer

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,410
and then the two nodes are

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,080
microcontrollers that have a sensor

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,940
peripherals attached to them so and

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,920
again that vestige of modularity of the

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,250
nodes the the flexibility of the system

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,110
we can see that highlighted here these

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,970
four nodes doesn't before but again

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,530
these nodes they can all have different

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,150
setups these different colored boards

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,530
represent different different metrics

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,260
that were collecting

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,670
four of them here we see might have some

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,020
that are all one metric one that haven't

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,480
just a couple sensors one that has a

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,120
wide variety on all of these nodes can

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,250
coexist in one network and can really

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,040
gather whatever data is needed to answer

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,660
the scientific question we're looking at

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
now let's talk about how we we chose the

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,080
particular devices we're going to look

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,800
at and I want to start with the feather

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,600
32 you four with low radio so this is an

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,690
Arduino compatible microcontroller made

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,870
by Adafruit their whole platform the

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,240
feather 32 u 4 platform has built in

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,410
support for a battery and then the

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,610
particular one we're using has a

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,950
built-in radio module so this device is

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,530
small it's easy to use because you can

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:33,210
program with Arduino with the Arduino

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:35,560
IDE and with easy to use code and the

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,850
built in battery makes easy to make the

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,310
remote deployment the whole thing is

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,800
small and compact and easy to put out in

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,600
the field it was an easy choice for us

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,940
just because we needed to have some

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,260
small they could they could use a radio

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,210
another another one is the Raspberry Pi

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,500
that we're using for the computer the

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,180
base station we just needed something

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,570
that could run some Python code to

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,700
analyze and and collect our data and you

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,040
know it's nice and small and lightweight

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,260
so it was it was a good choice for us

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,670
we'll just put it in like a ranger

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,020
station or somewhere dry where it can

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,850
have an internet connection and power

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,290
and then it can just receive the

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,640
messages and do a little bit of

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,280
processing and then put that right up

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,770
into the cloud

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,760
and now this this last technology is

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,500
really one of the things that really

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,070
allows us to have this flexibility so

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,920
these are es awards from atlas

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,900
scientific these boards really take the

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,090
hard questions of how do you how do you

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,790
take a digital measurement of the analog

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:32,550
world and how do you do that in a way

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,170
that's that's easy to use I mean there's

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,620
tons of scientific literature on how to

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,110
do good science for measuring things but

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,210
the short answer is it's complicated and

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,440
it's beyond the scope of people who are

00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,380
just trying to write some code and so

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,340
these devices come with all the

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,460
electronics and all the equipment needed

00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,800
to to measure and operate the sensors

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,710
and they present themselves as a device

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,810
that we can communicate with on a bus

00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,670
and I squared see communication bus and

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,960
the microcontroller can just send a

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,300
message to one of them saying hey I'd

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,640
like a reading and it can reply with

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,960
reading and text so something like a

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,460
temperature sensor we can just say I'd

00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,410
like to reading and then it says oh it's

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,050
twenty three point six seven degrees

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,940
centigrade and we can we can easily use

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,550
that for processing so these these

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,360
boards really make it easy for us and

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,250
that's sort of how we get that

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,500
modularity we can switch them out on the

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,060
fly whatever set if we need to make

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,510
these nodes we can put the write boards

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,130
in there

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,870
and plug in the write sensors it makes

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,720
it very straightforward for us to

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,100
collect the data now of course that made

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,030
it sound like it's all been easy but if

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,570
I talked about some of the challenges

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,370
and of course are some things we faced

00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,310
when we're working with these

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:45,780
so I go back to these Atlas scientific

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:47,040
boards they are easy to use but to take

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,840
an accurate reading of something like

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
electrical conductivity for instance you

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,950
you need to compensate for the

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,900
temperature of the water that is that

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,400
that is currently around the sensor and

00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,480
so to make an accurate reading we need

00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,130
to make sure that we have a temperature

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,690
sensor nearby that can that can come and

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,760
save that we need to make sure that

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,440
if we have multiple these sensors on one

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,510
node that the the microcontroller can

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,970
figure out which which one pairs with

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,800
which so we've had to develop a scheme

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,080
for how to address the devices so that

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,970
on startup the the node can discover

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,410
what is what is plugged into it and

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,910
figure out how to how to make those

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,410
links internally so that I can correctly

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,300
correctly offset the readings and

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,170
everything so these boards can do that

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,330
correctly for us

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,190
so that was one challenge and we're

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,360
still working to implement that we have

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,100
a plan for that

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,290
another one that was really challenging

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,500
was we wanted to measure pressure but we

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,720
could not find suitable suitable

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,980
pressure sensor at the hobbyist level we

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,660
found some some hobby store like I

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,280
wouldn't say amateur but some some you

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,890
know sensors that weren't a similar

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,510
price range similar quality to the Atlas

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,920
scientific ones that we were using to

00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,990
measure pressure but they were not

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,130
really designed for underwater use they

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,040
were difficult to waterproof or

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,890
impossible to waterproof and so we won't

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,540
they weren't really applicable and we we

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,120
struggled to find one of those that was

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,180
that was that was good for our needs so

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,070
we had to find a more expensive and more

00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,210
industrial grade water water like

00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,610
pressure measuring sensor that's

00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,050
designed to actually be submerged and

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,120
then because that was our like that

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,220
custom thing we had we had to write our

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,140
own sort of interface for that so a

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,900
device that we can talk to that actually

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,150
does some of the electronics to take a

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,010
reading from that pressure sensor and so

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,620
that was that was a challenge but that's

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,210
thing most recently worked out we've

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,640
managed to find this pressure sensor and

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,990
and develop the necessary glue logic

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,330
sort of between the pressure sensor and

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,360
the microcontroller so they can talk to

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,130
each other and so that's that's where

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,800
we're at with the pressure sensor

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,270
and and having done that we do have a

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,920
Minimum Viable Product so I want to talk

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,860
about where we're at currently with the

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,540
project and essentially the great thing

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,220
is if we go back to this schematic we do

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,290
have full data flow if you have data

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,280
going to the sensor the sensor is able

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,110
to communicate back to the electric

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,330
controller and bring the data up to the

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,620
node node is able to use its radio and

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,060
communicate that data over the base

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,070
station which is connected to the

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,580
Raspberry Pi and it can they can grab

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:15,430
that data and send it up to the cloud

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:18,220
and here is a graph that we that we did

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:20,470
using using a test that we're doing so

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,970
this was in our lab bench we set up a

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:27,100
temperature sensor on our bench with a

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,260
with a one node and a couple of sensors

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,400
but this is just a temperature reading

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,250
and we can see a graph here of the

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,050
temperature over over 24 hours over the

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,000
span of two days you see a big spider

00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,290
beginning where my coworker held onto

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,460
the sensor for a couple minutes and you

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,560
can see how that present pair right back

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,900
up and then it came down you can see the

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,130
ambient temperature in the room how it

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,660
kind of rose after they turned off the

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,460
EC in the middle of the night and then

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,900
right back down again at about 6:00 in

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,910
the morning when they turn the AC back

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,170
on in the building so it's kind of

00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,570
interesting and that really highlights

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,490
we think what what our system is capable

00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,760
of it's a nice demonstration that we're

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,410
actually able to get that full data flow

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,370
so yeah I'll pass it off to grace to

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,540
talk a little bit about some of the

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,310
related work and some of the other

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,650
sensor networks that are being developed

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,570
or have been developed and and how they

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,470
stack up against our network and what we

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,470
think set stars apart

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:23,030
so yes as Charlie mentioned there have

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,669
been other efforts to create

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:29,539
environmental monitoring systems such as

00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:32,150
ours but until now nothing has achieved

00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,380
all four of the major goals that we

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:39,460
mentioned at the beginning of our talk

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:42,679
open source Licata scalable flexible

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:47,270
there have been systems that have

00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:50,000
achieved flexibility but not much else

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:55,299
let's look at the Aqua troll 600 for

00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,590
example the cost of one device the one

00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:02,720
know device is $3,500 and this is

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,799
without sensors and we've been able to

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,580
achieve the same functionality for 100

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:14,720
times cheaper with the Adafruit feather

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,340
there have been on the Congress systems

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,980
that are open source low cost and

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:27,360
scalable but lack the flexibility of

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:33,300
being able to use a wide range of

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:35,420
censors and numbers of sensors so let's

00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:40,470
look at some examples of that

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:43,170
in essence the other Arduino sensor

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,690
network deployments have had different

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:49,470
research interests and overall they

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:53,250
fielded much less data and much less

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,280
metrics data about much less metrics so

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,900
for example there was a cave

00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:03,600
investigation from Meadows at all and

00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:07,710
they only focused on three metrics

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,290
pressure temperature and conductivity so

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:15,420
it was sort of a smaller scale project

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:17,160
and also they did not have a moduli

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,900
system like what we're trying to achieve

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:24,990
and they also it wasn't Wireless and

00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:28,830
also there was a soil monitoring project

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:31,110
from Pierrot Edel where the only metric

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,020
that they cared about was the moisture

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,570
content of the soil and a seismic

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:42,080
reading project from solar Lawrence

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,080
where similarly only one

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,810
metric was collected the acceleration of

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,610
the ground movement so I'm gonna pass it

00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,010
off to Joel who's going to conclude the

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,340
talk and tell you about what our next

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,610
steps are

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:03,450
okay thank you very much grace and now I

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:05,610
will do exactly those things so first of

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,000
all now that we have a Minimum Viable

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:12,720
Product we next have to take some steps

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,460
to harden our system and in order to do

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,870
that we have several different kind of

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,120
categories of tests that we want to do

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,940
first of all we need to make sure that

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,980
we actually can communicate in the kind

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,210
of range that we want to that we can

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,000
actually communicate across the beach

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,150
and you know from like what what are the

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,280
actual parameters for deployment so

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:34,040
first we want to determine the

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,810
communication range then we also want to

00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,630
see if they actually are resistant to

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,770
weather that we have this idea that

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,310
there's going to be waterproof and that

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:46,200
they're gonna be submerged partially

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,090
submerged in beaches and in ground water

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,280
so we need to actually do some

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,930
real-world tests to make sure that

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,420
that's actually true first we're

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,980
thinking of doing a river test the

00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,860
Merrimack River is very close to our lab

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,660
so you do one nearby then maybe at the

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,490
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute

00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,850
perhaps which is a little further away

00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:08,130
but a little more realistic and that'll

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,690
feed into that's similar to our actual

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,970
deployment environment which I will get

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,590
to in a minute and of course a third

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:17,250
category of software stability we don't

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:19,110
want some calculation or some counter or

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,700
something to be just slightly off in a

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,590
way that you know over months and months

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,270
it turns out that all our data was

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,460
useless the entire time so we need to

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,310
actually

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,710
make sure that the software works wish

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:32,360
it's just as important as the other two

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,040
because then we want to actually deploy

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,830
our system because we want to go

00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,970
hurricane hunting that is the initial

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:42,950
deployment of our system we want to

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,200
install our sensor network around two to

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:48,800
three months before the hurricane season

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,160
in duck North Carolina at the US Army

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,860
Corps of Engineers research facility so

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,750
first we want to get kind of a baseline

00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,220
control data set that's why we want to

00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,600
install a few months before and then

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,310
once the hurricane season actually

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,590
starts we can gather an experimental

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:07,460
data set and then from that contrast to

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:09,710
be able to build a data model of what

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,990
kind of changes are actually occurring

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:15,580
how the climate is changing how these

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:19,190
metrics are actually being affected by

00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,690
general changes to the climate because

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,160
that's really what science is about

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,410
these days we just want to gather large

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,950
amounts of data and then we ran out

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,340
rhythms on it so that's what we want to

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,070
do we want to scale the data set

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,739
and then draw conclusions from there and

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,419
so now just to give a brief overview of

00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:39,820
what we discussed we won over the

00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:41,259
scientific problem that we know that the

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,469
climate is changing and there are many

00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:46,570
different brand new ler aspects of that

00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:48,789
change that we just don't understand

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,099
that we just don't have enough data to

00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:53,229
really make accurate conclusions about

00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:55,080
and so that's what we're doing we just

00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:57,999
want to gather lots and lots of data

00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,460
using a scalable low-cost modular sensor

00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:03,609
network and of course where we are today

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,649
is that we have the data flow and we

00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:08,109
have the chips working and talking to

00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:10,749
each other and we'd want to hard in the

00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:12,070
system and iterate on it and improve it

00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:15,339
to the point where we can actually start

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:17,729
gathering these large data sets and so

00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:21,759
finally I will conclude with a brief

00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:23,710
demonstration of the system and so we do

00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,679
not have our sensor network set up here

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:30,159
but we do have a small deployment going

00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:34,899
on at our laboratory and so just as a

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:39,539
reminder here's our architecture and I

00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:39,539
have an open SSH session we would close

00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,870
okay I was signed in but now I'm just

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,720
going to sign it again because we didn't

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:55,610
get enacted for too long

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,610
close the connection so we have

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:04,540
an active data set collection going on

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:07,700
[Music]

00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,720
so now I'm going into school servers and

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,220
then from there I'm going into a

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,170
specific computer where we're actually

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,470
gathering the data and now I'm in and so

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,470
here we are

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,700
those are some more messages as I know

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,700
that's a random loop

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,769
here it is so here's our data being

00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:30,840
gathered real-time unfortunately there

00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:33,899
was some connection that fell out and so

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,059
the data ends like I'd around 10:20 last

00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:38,489
night but you know before that I was

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:40,980
saving around every five minutes and so

00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:45,269
as you can see we have timestamps and

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:48,149
then we have a node ID and then a sensor

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:49,320
ID say like this so like sixty eight

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,619
represents the temperature which is

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,950
online so I actually work we have C

00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:58,130
seven represents the battery life and so

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,560
the representative

00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,440
[Music]

00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,370
yeah it's like it's analog digital

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,070
conversion thanks it's not the most

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,390
straightforward number honestly and

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,910
another one I think is measuring

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,930
conductivity right yeah yeah but you

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,500
know there's not really much that's

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:18,430
being conducted there's no water so but

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,430
you know to gather data

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,309
which aspect

00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:30,799
okay so we have yeah we have the the

00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:34,249
note identifier for some particular

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,159
feather device and then we have IDs for

00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:38,869
the particular sensors on the nodes so

00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:40,879
here for seven we have there's a

00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:43,399
representation of battery life it's

00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:46,099
using kind of weird units so it's it's

00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:50,029
not it's not entirely straightforward to

00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:53,059
convert that to volts or something then

00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,830
yeah and then here this one was this

00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:56,690
temperature unfortunately was unplugged

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,330
so it's giving us a little error value

00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:01,190
that's what we attempted to do was go

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,529
and plug in the temperature sensor and

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,559
then there was a there was an error in

00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:10,389
kind of connectivity but we still do

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,389
have the data so it's

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,460
yeah

00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,500
[Music]

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:24,580
yeah yeah so using that we have a

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,500
mapping of the sensor IDs to the actual

00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,090
sensor types of the units and then with

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:38,470
that you know we can process this text

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:39,320
file and process to date okay yeah

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,410
that's a hardware

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,410
[Music]

00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:50,350
electrical conductivity although I think

00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:52,810
that it's dependent oh no its oxidation

00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:56,400
reduction potential yeah so if we're

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:59,230
going to start questions I don't want to

00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:05,130
what I was gonna say in 10 seconds from

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:09,580
what I was saying without further ado

00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:13,420
can open it up to questions so yeah any

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,710
questions yeah as people ask questions

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,750
please do raise your hands I'll get the

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,310
mic to you and if you can if you're not

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:23,170
near the end of an aisle please move to

00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:25,150
one so I'm gonna I'm gonna start

00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,060
alright hey guys so I just had a

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,260
question about so your node your sensor

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,590
nodes here the idea is that they're

00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,730
running on battery eventually right so

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,850
this creates did you come up with a

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,110
power budget yet I know that a lot of

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,570
these sensors can be particularly

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,220
power-hungry so you might have to think

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,270
about putting into sleep states and

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,980
stuff like that

00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,640
yep that's absolutely something we're

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:51,520
working on so whatever reason there's a

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,680
photo that didn't show up but the the

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
big concern is we're writing the code

00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,010
how do we make sure we're putting

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,560
devices in a low power and sleep state

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,290
where possible these atlas scientific

00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,530
ease of sensors support a built in sleep

00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,640
mode and so we do have to make sure

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,810
whenever we ask them for reading then

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,760
just say ok and I'll go back to sleep

00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,740
and we also had to investigate how to

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,280
put the microcontroller into a interest

00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,770
of a deeper sleep and so yeah we're

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,650
using we're using both of those two to

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,090
minimize the power usage and what the

00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,680
tests that we that were running right

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,650
now was actually was a battery life test

00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,970
and so I guess we hoped it would finish

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,130
dinner so we could bring the system here

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,780
but it went along there I guess we have

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,060
more battery life than we'd expected and

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,700
so we can only show you the data from

00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,320
where it's still being collected but

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,880
yeah that's a big concern is how do we

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,040
have an make sure we're not using enough

00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,540
I'm not using too much power and how do

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,950
we how do we conserve that so we can go

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,360
for the couple of months we want to

00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,320
collect the data so that's that's really

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,320
a great question

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:57,179
and also for other artery no sensor

00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,809
networks solar energy has been

00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:04,039
implemented so that's something that we

00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:04,039
could look into as well

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,200
community further questions

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,870
what's your plan for the schematic you

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,400
shouldn't going into the ground how deep

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,780
do you see them going and are you

00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,160
actually gonna be digging them out

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,450
you're gonna get some machinery where

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,700
you want to be what's your plan for

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,400
getting the sensors into the ground yes

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:35,480
so short answer is were the software

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:38,300
people so you talked to our dear

00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,500
colleague mr. James hice but the gist of

00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,260
it is I believe we're looking for a

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,900
deployment of maybe between 5 to 10

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,480
maybe even 9 to 15 meters or so and just

00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,310
at different different depths and

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,830
placing the sensors in there and then

00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,150
measuring the water I mean because it's

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,120
right near the beach and so even if

00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,960
there are only 5 or 10 meters down

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,390
you're starting to run into obviously

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,860
like beach water and groundwater from

00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,240
the aquifer and really like we're

00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,300
looking at that interface between them

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,950
and how that changes so we we can

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,170
measure like essentially how much of

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:11,210
that water at that depth is is sort of

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,620
how salty is it and other things like

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,050
that to really understand where we're at

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,610
in that mixing and up see how that

00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:20,140
changes in response to the things we're

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,140
trying to we're trying to investigate

00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:40,779
how long is the program expected to run

00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:42,640
for so we want to have like an initial

00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:45,100
employment of two or three months plus

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,370
another deployment for the summer so

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:51,100
around five to six months total is is

00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,690
our target yeah yeah in two stages so

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,279
maybe with a change of battery in the

00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:58,140
middle but the software should be able

00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,140
to last that entire period

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,309
looks like we might be ready to wrap up

00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,420
questions certainly if you have

00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,490
questions that you want to ask

00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,530
face-to-face I think you folks will be

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,100
able to take those questions outside the

00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:21,860
conference room is that right

00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:24,010
all right thank you very much thank you

00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,010
