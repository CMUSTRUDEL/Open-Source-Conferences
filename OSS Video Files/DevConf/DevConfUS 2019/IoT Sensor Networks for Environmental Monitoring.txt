	Speakers: Grace Chin, Charlie Mirabile, and Joel Savitz

This presentation describes the development of a wireless sensor network system which automatically and continuously obtains and publishes sensor data in real-time. The system is modular and flexible in that it is applicable to a wide range of sensor types and numbers of sensor nodes.

At each sensor node, data obtained from sensors are read into an Arduino radio device. All node radio devices transmit their data to a base radio device, which is located at the base station. At the base station, the data are received by a Raspberry Pi computer, which is connected to the internet. The data are subsequently published to iSENSE, a web-based platform that allows researchers to not only quickly visualize the data but also to export the data for further processing using MATLAB.
