	Speaker: Matt Fuller

Used by Facebook, Netflix, Twitter, Uber, Lyft, and many others, Presto has become a ubiquitous solution for running fast SQL analytics across disparate data sources. Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine widely recognized for its low-latency queries, high concurrency, and native ability to query multiple data sources. These data sources may include Ceph, S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, Hadoop/HDFS, relational database systems such as PostgreSQL, and non-relational systems such as Apache Kafka. Presto’s connector based architecture allow you to query virtually anything.

In the first part of the talk we will focus on what Presto is, its background, and its architecture. In the second part of the talk we will learn about Presto’s cloud native capabilities using Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes. Kubernetes reduces the burden and complexity of configuring, deploying, managing, and monitoring containerized applications. To achieve these capabilities with Presto, Red Hat and Starburst partnered to provide the Presto Kubernetes Operator and the Presto Container on OpenShift.

The talk will also include a live demo of using Presto on Kubernetes and showing SQL federation of data between Ceph and other data sources. After the talk, you will have a good understanding of Presto basics and ready to participate in the Presto open source community as well as try Presto on your own.
