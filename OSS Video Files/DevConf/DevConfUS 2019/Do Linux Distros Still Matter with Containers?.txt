	Speaker: Scott McCarty 
In the beginning there was compiling and static linking. My first programs when I was 10 years old worked like that. Then, we discovered dynamic linking. This was great because we could now patch one library and all of the programs would pick up the change on restart. But we created another problem - dependencies. Throughout the history of computing we have solved one problem and created another. Containers are no different. This talk will walk through why we invented Linux distros and why we should continue to appreciate them in a world full of container hosts and images.
