Title: Linux System Roles: One playbook to rule them all
Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: DevConfUS 2019
Description: 
	Speakers: David Lehman and Shirly Radco

APIs strive to make programmer's jobs easier by keeping stability. Less attention is perhaps being paid to stability of system configuration, where interfaces include configuration file formats and various utilities.  Linux System Roles with Ansible helps to solve playbook incompatibilities as the OS interfaces change between releases and upgrades.

Attendees will learn about new Storage and Logging roles added to the Linux System Roles project to help configure Fedora, RHEL or CentOS systems consistently across multiple releases. The audience is assumed to have a basic understanding of Ansible and experience with Linux (preferably Fedora-derived) system administration.
