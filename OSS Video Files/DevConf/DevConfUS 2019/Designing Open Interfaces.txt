Open source design systems are becoming increasingly popular and with good reason. They enable more consistent and efficient development, helping teams build better product experiences faster. With them, we can improve user experiences by documenting use cases and ensuring the patterns are both universal and adaptable. Designing in the open promotes transparency, collaboration, and inclusion within design. So what is an open source design system, and how can you leverage one to make your life easier? In this workshop, members of Red Hat's design system, PatternFly, hope to cover all your burning questions: - Learn how to improve user experience and speed up both design and development - Get an overview of PatternFly and learn how our team collaborates with the greater community across design and development - Learn how challenging product requirements can be easily solved for by contributing to an open source design system
