Title: 20 Years Later (sponsored by Google Cloud) - Sarah Novotny (Google)
Publication date: 2018-07-19
Playlist: OSCON 2018 - Portland, Oregon
Description: 
	Sarah Novotny explains why open source is more important now than ever. First, customers need the ability to freely choose which combination of services and providers will best meet their needs over time. Second, customers need to orchestrate their infrastructure effectively across different environments to ensure adherence to business and industry standards.

Open source is the value that fuels new industries and pushes forward long-standing ones. Join us in person at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention to cover open source projects across all origins and affiliations. Learn more:  https://oreil.ly/2LQLJ8I

	00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:08,510
good morning everyone it's fun to be

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,670
back on the ask on stage so I'm gonna

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,500
make the point that open source is more

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,230
important now than ever

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,330
we've been on 20 years and this was my

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,580
abstract first customers need to freely

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,680
choose which combination of services and

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,210
providers will best fit their needs and

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,640
they need to orchestrate their

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,800
infrastructure across the different

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,080
environments effectively but that would

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,320
be the end of my conversation right we

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,839
should all agree on this so open source

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,729
is more important than ever this is how

00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:42,499
we can actually effectively do this so

00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,659
we learned a lot of things in these 20

00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:50,479
years open source is not free like

00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:52,639
sunshine it's more free like a puppy how

00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,280
many of you have had your business or

00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:58,670
house torn up by your evening with the

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,949
open source software we also learned

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,659
what we meant by open source software

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,870
open source software is software

00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,380
developed in a collaborative and public

00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,210
manner

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,210
now this can mean a bunch of different

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:14,210
things kubernetes and tensorflow for

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:18,560
example are two very different projects

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:22,160
and we have 20 million lines of other

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,780
code that in fact Google has contributed

00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,480
across the different repos that we have

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,210
and engage with so 47,000 repos and

00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,470
github have interactions from Googlers

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,600
in 2017 more than a billion interactions

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,710
actually happened pull requests and

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:46,700
comments by Google errs 5,000 Googlers

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:50,300
perform actions on github and almost 1%

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,430
of all the requests pull requests were

00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,570
performed by Googlers on github so we

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:59,060
have this huge investment in our

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,950
strategy with open-source so I mentioned

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,440
open source having these different

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,510
models open source projects open source

00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,179
software and there are two very

00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,670
different models we at Google think we

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,310
need both and an open source project

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,380
like tensorflow

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,680
or sorry like kubernetes is

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,020
more community-driven the project aspect

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,910
involves more and more people whereas

00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,670
tensorflow is much more open-source

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,280
software its company led very strongly

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,170
held closely held and interested in

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,560
engaging the community still but not

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,220
necessarily as a core contributor but

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,930
these pieces of open-source across the

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,730
twenty plus million pieces of code

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,070
across the fifty thousand different

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,540
projects across all of open-source are

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,760
what is the underpinning of what our

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,100
users have asked for our users have

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,440
asked for the ability to freely choose

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,570
and their own services and providers

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,520
that best meet their needs they need to

00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,250
orchestrate across different

00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,770
environments open source on top of

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,060
public clouds on top of public

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:13,460
infrastructure is the way that our users

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,150
are able to do this this is hybrid cloud

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,860
in a broad broad sense so if Google

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,890
wants to be the fastest growing cloud

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,500
and the most open cloud how can we get

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,140
there we get there in fact with lots of

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,320
work in open source making our users

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,300
giving our users opportunities to

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,350
interact with the different clouds and

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,330
that also requires making communities so

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,750
our communities and our open source

00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:45,440
interact together we have to empower our

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:48,560
users and power our communities to meet

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,830
their needs as they see them we need to

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,170
help them build and help us build tools

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,420
that our end-users are requesting that

00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,870
our end-users are making sure that we

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,630
need to make work port workloads

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,290
portable and make them engage well with

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,850
the many clouds and many workloads and

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,630
choices and services and providers that

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,750
people see so how do we do this what do

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,940
we need from you we need feedback

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,209
feedback is a gift if you tell us

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,600
something you we will listen we want to

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:26,210
understand your choices and you talent

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,210
have you challenged our assumptions we

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,060
also need you to help us build a diverse

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,639
diverse global community now this is a

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,229
diversity that isn't just your

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,539
background your experience your cultural

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,940
world your sexual orientation

00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:47,650
this is developer operator data science

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:52,069
low network traffic high data volatility

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:55,729
mix and match every different aspect of

00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:58,819
your world and show us different ways

00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:01,910
that you may make use of our products

00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,990
our tools our open source and then of

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,520
course come help us celebrate 20 years

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,520
we will have doughnuts at the Google

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,660
booth at 11 o'clock but do please come

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,279
help us celebrate thanks

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,279
