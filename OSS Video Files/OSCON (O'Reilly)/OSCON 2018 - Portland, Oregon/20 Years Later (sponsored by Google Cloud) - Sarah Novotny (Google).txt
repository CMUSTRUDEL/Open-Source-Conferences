Description: 
	Sarah Novotny explains why open source is more important now than ever. First, customers need the ability to freely choose which combination of services and providers will best meet their needs over time. Second, customers need to orchestrate their infrastructure effectively across different environments to ensure adherence to business and industry standards.

Open source is the value that fuels new industries and pushes forward long-standing ones. Join us in person at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention to cover open source projects across all origins and affiliations. Learn more:  https://oreil.ly/2LQLJ8I
