Roger McGough is here at OSCON in

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,919
Portland 2018 and I'm here with Adrian

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,790
and sahih de from AWS we're here to talk

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,070
about open source in the enterprise and

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,369
what AWS who's clearly a very important

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,080
player in this whole space is doing so

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,699
you were both here last year starting

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,039
from a small team what are you able to

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,740
accomplish in the past year what we're

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,359
recruiting last year really we spent the

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,830
first year building out the team and

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,680
this year we've got a few more things

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:38,430
going we we we just about got our

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,809
twitter handle going at last Oscar we go

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,610
we had a couple of people we need the

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:47,219
Twitter handles and now we've got a

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,750
website we've got a blog we do a couple

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,850
of blog posts a week so we've got we've

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,100
got a that you know the people we've got

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,480
the communication set up and we've got

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,010
specialists in different areas so that's

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,199
that's kind of you know getting

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,910
everything going and then we're engaging

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,070
with more of the AWS teams

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,080
the other big thing last year we joined

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,700
the cloud native computing foundation so

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,360
we did the internal justification to do

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,880
that and Arun and myself from that from

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,610
our team are basically the the CN CF

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,310
reps that manage that relationship and

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,530
with and then you know going through

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,049
getting good nettie support into the

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,970
company and developing a an open source

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,009
workshop that a lot of people

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,770
contributed to to build out how to run

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,509
good news on AWS and then actually

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,850
culminating the launch of the equipment

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,530
IDs product the eks at the end of the

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,659
year so that's probably the the biggest

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,579
thing that we have accomplished in the

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,799
last year yeah and along with that you

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,250
know Ã¶zkan was our kind of first big

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,950
presents last year and so we hired

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,460
somebody to come in and do events

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:59,960
shirley bales and we've been engaging

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,310
and a lot more events over last year and

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,960
and especially this year we're here

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,729
no big participation at OSCON and

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,010
participating in a lot of the

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,319
open-source activities and meetups and

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,569
some of the smaller community events as

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,690
well so we're supporting those two the

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,910
way things like the various foundations

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,450
other than just joining CN CF it's a

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,180
pretty big one but we've joined OSI and

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,650
a few others so we're sort of working on

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,269
get which foundations we should should

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,069
we be supporting are we the right level

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,540
in them how are we doing that so there's

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,310
the foundational thing we're all

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,980
submitting some work with some projects

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,200
with some of our customers and some

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,000
people may know I was the I helped

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,470
create the Netflix open source program

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,880
but we've actually gone back to that and

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,580
we doing some contributions to the

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,650
spinnaker project that Netflix came up

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,080
with and we actually have engineering

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,060
effort going into contributions to that

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,230
so trying to sort of mix it up and

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,420
figure out where we can be most helpful

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,310
and some of its outbound some of it is

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,069
working with the various engineering

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,810
teams across AWS the service teams to

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,160
say okay they're coming to us and saying

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,609
we're thinking of doing an open source

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,170
related thing to do with our service

00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,519
how come what's the best way of doing

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,670
that and how can we reach the

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:19,630
communities we need to another area as

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,310
well is that you know working working

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:26,170
with our engineering teams as Adrienne

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:29,019
mentioned we also work with the to do

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,889
group at the Linux Foundation which is a

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,720
collaboration of a bunch of kind of

00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,880
companies that are leading in the open

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,220
source space and sharing best practices

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:44,380
so we've released some tools that helped

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,530
us with some of our kind of management

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,450
of github repos and reporting we've got

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,380
an open source dashboard that's out

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,480
there as well and we've been

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,190
contributing to projects that are

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,709
helping other companies with the

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,660
compliance around open source so you

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,030
know the kind of roles that the open

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,260
source program office would typically

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,130
perform we've been supporting those as

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,200
well

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,790
I imagine that the foundations and other

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,910
organizations would really like to have

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,799
you guys as members is that true and are

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,060
you having to you mention that you

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,450
really got to decide who you're going to

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,640
draw

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,730
but it seems like you're an important

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,709
player and I mean we're den early

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,710
everyone wants us to join it's more

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,660
about you know what's from my team I

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,070
need somebody to be able to focus on if

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,169
somebody needs to turn up at both

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,460
meetings or working groups I've got to

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,530
be able to resources so it's mostly

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,800
about as as we're adding people to the

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,260
team we've had the bandwidth to take on

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,790
more entities that you know we want to

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,919
engage with and I'm adding different

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,450
specializations to the team sort of

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,120
broaden it down so that's really just

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,830
kind of as we get our act together and

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,960
get people on board we're able to take

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,060
on more things yeah and the Foundation's

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,979
have been just very positive and of

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,990
course and everyone's very keen first to

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,450
engage and participate so we've had an

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,520
overwhelming response yeah that's what I

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:06,340
would have imagined so what are you

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:08,229
announcing here at Ascot yeah I we had a

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,270
keynote and the announcement was this

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:15,669
book open source in the enterprise and

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,280
this is targeted not just the enterprise

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,620
for government and startups who want to

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,050
everyone there's a lot of people

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,570
consuming open source and obviously

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,370
every business out there that's building

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,530
services in the cloud is consuming open

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,740
source and the goal of this is to

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,590
provide resource material for

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,539
organizations and references to help

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,260
them with the questions they have around

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:45,010
consumption but also around contribution

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,479
so how do they contribute and where are

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,990
some of the resources how do they work

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,950
with the open source communities and

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,590
work in this sort of shared

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,660
collaborative way that we've been doing

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,400
for a long time and if they have a

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,889
project to release how do they do that

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,419
so you know referencing obviously a lot

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:06,880
of O'Reilly material and ref books that

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:08,919
have been written by some of the authors

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,229
that come to conferences like ah scorn

00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,440
but also the Linux Foundation has been a

00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:15,910
big contributor to this as well as well

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,789
as the to do group they have all these

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,440
guides online which are best practices

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:22,900
that some of the folks from different

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,159
companies what they've tried out what

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,400
works what doesn't work and they've been

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:29,350
posting a whole host of guides and

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,430
all of that materials reference in here

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:35,470
so it's it's a very great short summary

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,810
for anybody that's new to open source

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,120
already doing open source that wants to

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,240
learn more about the latest activities

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,190
yeah and just to reinforce why this is

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,620
probably important I had given a keynote

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,039
today about what's popular that we see

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,229
on our platform and the cloud despite it

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,229
not being very new is very popular and

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:58,060
clearly open-source is very popular kind

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,039
of dominating them you know the things

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,130
that we see the activity we see at our

00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:06,130
site so I think there's a lot of legs in

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:09,400
this space meaning there's gonna be many

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,560
many years of people working and this is

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,289
a you know have physical copies here at

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,449
OSCON and we have an online PDF that

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:20,500
anyone can download and it's on our

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:22,900
website open source door amazon.com and

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,699
they can go download and actually share

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,750
it with as many folks as they want to

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,870
cream

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:32,229
what can developers working on AWS

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:36,460
expect in the next ten months or so well

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:37,870
we've got we're supporting a lot of

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,610
things now so basically all the new

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,320
things coming out or open source but a

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,510
lot of the hot areas so particularly

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,520
machine learning and deep learning it's

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,590
really it's interesting because if you

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,110
go back five or ten years this was a

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,060
very proprietary kind of specialization

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,949
the hardware and the software was hard

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,590
to get to we've now reached the point

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,570
where the the most common and best

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,909
supported libraries and frameworks oral

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,919
open source and then the hardware is

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,260
available in the cloud by the second so

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:08,110
you can with really very little friction

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,470
now stand up a state-of-the-art deep

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,320
learning AI environment and it's enabled

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,060
a huge explosion in the number of people

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,039
with access to it in the reviews cases

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,159
so we're seeing that come up everywhere

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,190
and we're investing in more and more

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,740
ways to effectively productize that it

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,419
to make it easier to access and we've

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,690
got we've got a tool called sage maker

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:34,089
which is a basically a Jupiter framework

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,409
you know the Jupiter notebook system

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:39,909
open source framework but that lets you

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,510
but it's already got plugged into it

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,010
without

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,600
have to go and debug and get the right

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,190
version of Python installed and all

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,050
these kinds of things all of that

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,520
stuff's debug for using just get on with

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,650
building the thing you want you're a

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,560
data scientist or an analyst you want to

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:56,290
do some work but we're pulling in you

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,660
know fully integrated versions of

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,970
tensorflow and MX net and pi torch and

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,560
chain ER and we just added chain or a

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,660
few months ago it's important to the

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,970
Japanese market so as well as these new

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,530
frameworks come along and I talked

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,260
didn't exist two years ago was only

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,210
announced early last year so we're

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,420
seeing this is a very rapidly moving

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,550
space where new algorithms and new

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,290
frameworks are just popping up the

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,360
domain of what domain of what it can do

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,910
is getting broader so I think you'll see

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,800
a lot of activity there and a lot more

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,630
applications being built where people

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,210
are figuring out how to apply AI to

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,550
things that are you know just sort of do

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,290
our thing plus plus AI is new things

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,810
right we're getting a lot of that kind

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,340
of activity right now right and are you

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,490
doing anything around making the

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,130
interface to AWS easier as open-source

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,080
projects is that yeah we open sourced

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,610
all our documentation and now it's that

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,860
a few months ago so basically if you

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,470
find anything that is confusing or a

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,270
spelling mistake or whatever you send us

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,520
a pull request on github and we and

00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,340
that's actually now how how we got all

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,220
of the everything there right so it's

00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,280
that that's what one of the one of the

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,310
ways there's a lot of other ways to make

00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,350
things easier to manage we're always

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,390
taking customer input to make the

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,890
products better sounds great

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,580
well thanks both for you for your time

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,580
