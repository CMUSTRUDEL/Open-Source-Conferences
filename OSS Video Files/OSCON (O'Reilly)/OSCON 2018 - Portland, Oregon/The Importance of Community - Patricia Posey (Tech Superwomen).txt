Publication date: 2018-07-19
Playlist: OSCON 2018 - Portland, Oregon
Description: 
	Tech can be an isolating industry. Our communities inspire us, support us, bring us together, and help us build better products. It is also our communities that hold us accountable. In this talk, Posey draws on her non-traditional journey into tech to illustrate how honest investments can build a sustainable community that is integral to the advancement of its members.

I'm excited to talk to you today about

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:12,890
community and why it matters in

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,230
particular reason because my journey

00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:20,390
into tech was non-traditional whatever

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:25,429
that means basically my job was highly

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:28,939
administrative a lot of repetitive tasks

00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:33,590
and I was sitting there thinking there's

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:37,670
got to be a better way and so I started

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:40,100
googling things found over Stack

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,090
Overflow and effectively embarrassed

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,250
myself on the platform but then I

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,190
learned to ask better questions and gain

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,070
community and I learned that I could

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:56,719
write scripts to automate processes and

00:00:52,070 --> 00:01:03,079
I became addicted automate all the

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:06,680
things I got really ambitious and went

00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,330
for larger projects and the larger

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,990
project that I went for happened to be a

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:16,640
data automation product and I learned

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:19,940
that I had a top of CTO and in turn to

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,930
my surprise he gave me product ownership

00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:26,660
and a team and through an iterative

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:30,190
process we landed with a product that

00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:37,100
was then implemented company-wide

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:38,510
cut to the tech superwoman summit the

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,270
thought Leadership Summit around

00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,250
diversity in tech in San Francisco in

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,480
partnership with my sister Katherine

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,060
Posey for inaugural summit I was tasked

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,510
with developing the community and

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:58,030
audience around our summit so I started

00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:02,030
at home with the tech inclusion groups

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:04,850
meetups right here in Oregon I started

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,230
showing up learning about everything

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,349
that they were about learning about

00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,710
their needs started bringing gluten-free

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:15,160
vegan pizza which is a requirement in

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,160
Portland

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,660
but I started making these honest

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,340
investments in the community an intern

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,340
