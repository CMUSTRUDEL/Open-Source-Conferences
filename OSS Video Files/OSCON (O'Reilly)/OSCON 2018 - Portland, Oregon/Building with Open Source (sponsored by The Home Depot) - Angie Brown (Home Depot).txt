my name is Angie Brown and it's

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,160
wonderful to be with you today my roles

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,920
and responsibilities right now I

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,400
actually lead our store technology

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,560
development team and included in that is

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,720
our order management system and just to

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,960
clarify what I mean when I say store

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,210
technology is anything from our point of

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,609
sale when you come into our stores to

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,160
the systems that we use to mix your

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,010
paint to how we design your kitchen

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,350
cabinet to the systems that we use to to

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,880
manage and maintain all the copious

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,130
amounts of inventory you see on our

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,410
shelves whenever you shop with us we

00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,900
also build our order management systems

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,300
which power interconnected retail and

00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,570
interconnected retail to us is is really

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,780
the convergence of both our online and

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,070
brick-and-mortar stores I'm assuming

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,070
most of you are familiar with Home Depot

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,730
thank you thank you

00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,369
most are and when you think of Home

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,850
Depot this is what you think of we're a

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,770
very large retailer we operate across

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,210
North America in 50 States Canada Mexico

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,060
by a quick show hands how many of you

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,360
should have shopped with us glad to see

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,340
it fun fact over 90 percent of the

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,760
population is actually within just 10

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,770
miles of a Home Depot store but not as

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,250
many people consider the amount of

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,630
Technology that it takes to power the

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,840
world's largest home improvement

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:42,900
retailer now how many of you know why

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:45,120
were das gone no hands we have a growing

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,430
set of technology hubs and innovation

00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,710
labs across the u.s. our headquarters

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,130
are actually in Atlanta but we also have

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,950
a facility in Austin and Dallas in the

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,530
Bay Area and right here in Portland as

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,900
well across North America we have

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,030
approximately 3,000 technology

00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,299
associates and we're adding another

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,549
thousand this year alone as Cheryl this

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,979
is background is what it takes to

00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:14,160
operate a hundred billion dollar

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,560
retailer at the center of all we do to

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,099
create experiences that delight you when

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,780
you shop with us it's technology

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,060
technology and our stores and our supply

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,739
chain and merchandising and our

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,440
corporate systems and of course on our

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,080
digital experiences and as you know

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,810
speed is the name of the game the pace

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,550
of retail is fast it's really fast and

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,440
we say that it's changed more in the

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,709
last four years than it has in the last

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,890
40 our customers demand more quicker

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,200
delivery seamless shopping seamless

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,690
checkout interconnected experiences

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,230
between our store and brick-and-mortar

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,110
and of course the speed of technology is

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,890
moving in at least double that pace

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,900
yesterday you may have heard from

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,120
actually two of our associates who spoke

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,330
about our personal transition from

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,030
waterfall to agile we push ourselves to

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,459
be faster and more efficient in our

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,890
development and that's also where open

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,900
source comes in for us I mentioned our

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,140
size and scale earlier were a big

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,840
company but we do try to operate like a

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,780
really big startup technology is a

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,250
differentiator for us when we look ahead

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,070
over the next three years we're

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,160
investing 11 point 1 billion dollars and

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,030
our strategic initiatives in 2.9 billion

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,060
of that is in technology alone that said

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,459
we also look to build our highly

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,040
tailored and optimized solutions and

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,920
house we do that a lot

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,680
in fact we do it over 90% of the time

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,420
we're building our own software

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,040
open-source is a key ingredient to help

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,440
us more quickly develop the custom

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,590
solutions we need to power our business

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,739
so how are we using open-source to help

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,620
us build actually we've been using it

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,200
for about a decade now Linux and Tomcat

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,620
have powered our store compute platforms

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,680
for almost 10 years and our mindset now

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,389
is open source first some of the ways

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,230
that were using that or with

00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:16,410
homedepot.com

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,090
it's the world's largest e-commerce one

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,039
of the world's largest e-commerce sites

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:25,289
and it's completely homegrown we use

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:28,979
open source solutions like Cassandra for

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,270
storage solar for search we also have a

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,190
customer order manage

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,070
system that helps connect the orders

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,950
from all of our channels think by online

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,470
pick up in store we use elastic for

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,840
search here and we use Redis for caching

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,840
to help our associates track and assist

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,030
with orders with ease and speed to

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,910
process at scale we use distributed

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,980
computing frameworks like spark we

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,600
create cloud native software that's

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,050
highly available on multiple data

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,020
centers because we must be extremely

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,520
responsive and we must scale and of

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,630
course we use machine learning to help

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,600
crunch terabytes or even petabytes of

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,990
data for our forecasting systems and

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,270
more so there's a lot going on and we

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,210
always ask ourselves what's next but

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,570
before we do I do want to acknowledge

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,090
how indebted we are to the open source

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,940
community we've talked a lot about our

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,700
size and scale and our accomplishments

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,820
but hopefully you see through here how

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,400
critical open source has been to us we

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,130
learn better with you and we thank you

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,230
our contribution to open source remains

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,380
strong and we look our commitment and we

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,060
look to continue to increase our

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,240
contribution I mentioned earlier that

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,460
our teams are growing and as we grow

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,670
this collaboration will remain an

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,410
essential part of our success

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,720
collaboration with our teams with our

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,120
vendors and with the open source

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,490
community as we continue to learn and

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,890
grow we look forward to building the

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,690
future of retail with you and together

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,610
thank you very much for the opportunity

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,960
to speak with you today hopefully you've

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,760
learned a little bit more about Home

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,040
Depot and why were at OSCON

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,720
we have a number of our associates here

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,570
this week I encourage you to connect

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,290
with us at booth 515 thank you for your

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,449
