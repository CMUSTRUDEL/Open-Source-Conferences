	00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,520
we are gonna end as we usually do with

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,080
some awards for open source so this year

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,209
we did a little different we actually

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,280
Kelsey Scot and I had the brain trust

00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:17,310
right here came up with three different

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,320
awards to give out to projects and we

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,949
nominated a few people our scuse me

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,130
projects and we actually asked you to

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,939
vote for them so the awards are going to

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,960
be the most impact award which is uh

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:34,590
significantly changing how we actually

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,820
do our software stuff breakout project

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,140
of the year something that could have

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,149
been simmering for a while could have

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,160
come up quick but is that a tipping

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,600
point and is no longer just being talked

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,850
about but is actually being implemented

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,710
and then a Lifetime Achievement Award

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,739
which I feel like is self-explanatory

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,730
so with the first award Kelsey is gonna

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:59,489
do the honors you guys should be really

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:02,489
excited this is like the Oscar Oscars so

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,890
the first award is the first ever most

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,350
impact award and this one is a special

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,960
award for me mainly because it had a

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,240
real impact on my life I may be early

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,610
decision to get deep into the details of

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,990
kubernetes and outside of the community

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,030
I learned a lot about distributed

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,590
systems what it's worth light to work

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,600
with a lot of bright people solving

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,670
really really hard problems willing to

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,410
share the impact that kubernetes has

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,390
made on the entire software industry

00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,830
from every major cloud provider to

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,750
people like Home Depot that are running

00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,320
kubernetes out on the edge in their

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,300
stores

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,100
it's literally changed the game and with

00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,740
that I would like to honor kubernetes as

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,210
the most impact award of the year so we

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,900
have COO Bernays team members out to

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,320
accept the award

00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,700
[Applause]

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:52,280

[Applause]

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,000
okay next up breakout project of the

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,100
year as I mentioned this is really

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,050
something that's gone from being talked

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,370
about being played with to something

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,690
that people are actually using and

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,990
implementing and putting into production

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,200
so the winner this year is something

00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:34,690
that was released in 2016 and it is

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,730
vault from Hoshi Corp and it secures

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,920
stores and tightly controls access to

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,000
tokens passwords and all that good

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,050

00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:21,480
of defining what open source means goes

00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:24,519
