hi I'm Roger McGough Louis I'm here at

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,080
Ascot in Portland 2018 and I'm here with

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:13,019
Jim striking gas or Shrek who works for

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,000
HPE hewlett-packard enterprise and we're

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,859
going to talk a little about HPE and

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,850
open source sounds good

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,350
you know how long has HP e been involved

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,900
in open source I guess we're going back

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,029
to even HP days yeah so going back to HP

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,429
days in fact one of the things I love

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,170
about hewlett-packard and Hiller Packard

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,440
Enterprise is we've always had this

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,940
culture of open collaboration and it all

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,120
goes all the way back to the days of

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,040
next bench where engineers would look at

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,420
each other and talk about common

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,309
problems that we're trying to solve put

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,840
their heads together and do it sometimes

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,370
those solutions ended up just in the

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,840
workbench other times they became

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,239
products but it was a great way to

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,879
innovate we've also had a long history

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,699
of giving back to the community so when

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,190
Linux hit the scene in the 90s and open

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,160
stores started to really take off we

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,500
were all in and proud to say we've been

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
active participants and contributors to

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,650
open source ever since it's just in our

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,330
DNA mm-hmm so you know open source is

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,310
kind of a process where there's a lot of

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,299
learning can take place so I think the

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,729
most important things you've learned

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,909
from the open source efforts you've been

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,770
doing so we were just discussing this in

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,310
a session we had yesterday I think

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,110
probably the four most important points

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,759
I would bring up is one focus on the

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,560
community the community is the

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,720
cornerstone to any successful open

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,909
source project so you know if you create

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,750
an atmosphere of trust and transparency

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,259
and you nurture the community you can

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,460
have a successful product if you don't

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,049
you could have the most successful

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,100
technology in the world and it's not

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,710
going to go anywhere without the

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,720
community so that's one the second would

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,020
be to if you have an open source program

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,979
office don't just focus it on compliance

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,810
and auditing there's a holistic view of

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,780
open source that I think is important

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,550
help the businesses to align on an open

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,590
source strategy what do you want to do

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,640
with open source how you want to use it

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,230
how you want to engage with the

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,950
community

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,890
find a way to address compliance by

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,720
cooperating and helping that engineers

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,709
understand what it is to be compliant

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,680
have a community outreach program and to

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,420
the extent possible work on educating

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,739
the workforce a lot of people still

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,099
don't understand the power of open

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:38,000
source and what it's about so I would

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,620
say make sure that your internal

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,530
developers can contribute personally in

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,610
addition to corporate contributions

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,200
anymore I think most developers would

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,290
tell you it's not just about the resume

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,760
it's about the github commit log so

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,620
being able to enable them to do that is

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,569
important for personal professional

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,690
growth but it's also important in

00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:00,329
building an effective workforce and then

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,829
I think finally I would say to the

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,769
extent possible make the work you do

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:06,540
inside the enterprise match the best

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,910
practices outside in the open source

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,340
community it makes it so much easier to

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,379
onboard people it makes it easier to

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,510
collaborate inside and outside at the

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,459
same time those are the things I think

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,440
are probably most important that makes a

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,230
lot of sense so give them the HP e's

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,940
long commitment and use of open source

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,799
what are the cool projects you're

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,600
excited about well there are a lot of

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,819
exciting open-source projects maybe I

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,810
just highlight a few that we're in the

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,760
middle of right now

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,780
one is grommet I actually think grommet

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,950
is a great next bench story we noticed

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,810
that there were a lot of enterprise

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,880
products that we had that didn't have

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,260
the same kind of user experience so

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,019
engineers put their heads together and

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,359
they developed grommet which is a way of

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,579
styling a tool set for styling and

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:53,700
designing consistent user experience

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:55,709
that's branded and after they did that

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,019
they realized hey you know customers

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,370
love this we love it I think the

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,349
community would get a lot out of this

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,700
and so they open sourced it and now

00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:07,410
we've got a huge community out there and

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,989
we're getting you know thousands of

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,180
downloads a month tens of thousands of

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,519
visits so it's a real success story I

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,789
would say second one I would highlight

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:21,719
is probably a newer one this is the HP

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:23,490
deep learning cookbook and you know

00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,110
we're doing a lot of AI with our

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,949
intelligent edge work

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,349
hybrid IT and one of the frustrations is

00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,449
there aren't a lot of benchmarks and

00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:35,310
tools to help you select the most

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,800
efficient way to do your training and

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,039
then inference so some of the labs

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,780
researchers at HPE got together and they

00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,939
developed those benchmarks they

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,039
developed a set of guidelines and tools

00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,330
it's been very helpful to us and now

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,469
hopefully it's going to be helpful to

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,750
the community I think it's going to get

00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:54,240
a lot of traction with the importance of

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,879
AI I guess the third one I'd highlight

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,159
would be probably the linux ki toolset

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,310
this is a really cool open source

00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:04,379
project that we've done that allows you

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,930
to do performance troubleshooting and

00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,759
linux and it's been very very effective

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,699
for us and trying to improve the

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,069
performance of machines running linux

00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:18,150
our customers are using it and now it's

00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:20,219
available at the community so so I've

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,800
heard that HP launched a Developer

00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:25,080
Program yeah what does that mean a

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,900
little more sure so we have a lot of

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,210
passion around making hybrid IT simple

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,979
and so we thought it would be a good

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,259
idea to bring the external development

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,469
community in to help with this mission

00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,659
so in Austin in December of last year we

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:44,479
launched this HPE dev community and you

00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:46,830
can check it out it's at HPE Devi oh and

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,949
basically we're curating open source

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,279
projects around some of our platforms

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,779
and products in the hybrid IT space and

00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,270
the reason we're doing this is we think

00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,089
it'll be very effective to increase the

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,520
functionality and and improve the ease

00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:04,529
with which you can do hybrid IT we want

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,029
to accelerate innovation which is often

00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,479
the case when you bring in the external

00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:11,490
community and we think that it'll be

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,270
good for our engineers to collaborate

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,469
more closely in this space so one of the

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,189
platforms we have in this play in this

00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:23,009
space is one sphere and one sphere is a

00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,259
multi cloud management solution allows

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,500
you to create clouds anywhere deploy

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,750
apps and then gain insight into the

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,819
operations of those apps so we already

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,080
have a number of open source projects

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,509
that have popped up there we've got

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,760
language bindings around Python and

00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,560
JavaScript and go

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,540
we've got partners that are jumping in

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,220
and innovating there so chef is in there

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,830
they're doing some solutions around one

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,380
sphere and they're also posting to our

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,750
blog which is kind of cool so it's

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,510
exciting it's growing fast and we want

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,150
to invite developers if you share this

00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:01,560
passion around hybrid IT come join us go

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:04,200
to the HP ewo portal join our slack

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,110
channel join the conversation and let's

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,270
build some cool stuff HP has a kind of a

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,040
famous culture you know the HP way

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,400
there's the three rules about everything

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,170
well I know it seems pretty like

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,000
synchronized with open-source how much

00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,280
do you think that that it's affected the

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,770
kind of HP attitude and how much do you

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,410
think carried over into your open source

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,660
efforts yeah I think I think it's a very

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,820
good point I think a lot of the HP way

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,950
and the openness and not having

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,770
boundaries or hierarchy artificially

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,050
imposed it's really a meritocracy and

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,850
that's the way open-source is - so I

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,430
think you're right I think it has

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,830
increased the compatibility of what we

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,630
do and what we believe with the way the

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,830
open source community operates I think

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,520
it's one of the reasons that we get

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,130
along so well

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,000
mm-hmm sounds great ok thanks a lot

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,000
