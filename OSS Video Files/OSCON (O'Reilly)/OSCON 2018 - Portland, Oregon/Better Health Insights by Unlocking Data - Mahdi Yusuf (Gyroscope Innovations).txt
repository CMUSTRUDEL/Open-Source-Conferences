Title: Better Health Insights by Unlocking Data - Mahdi Yusuf (Gyroscope Innovations)
Publication date: 2018-07-19
Playlist: OSCON 2018 - Portland, Oregon
Description: 
	Mahdi Yusuf discusses new ways to unlock hidden potential from data you currently generate with smart health devices. Along the way, he dives into key health metrics and misconceptions past, present, and future, illustrates insights with real-world data examples, and details the effects theyâ€™ve had on respective candidates. Mahdi concludes by examining the issues that arise with privacy and its importance to maintain public trust.

sleep is something that people find very

00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:06,620
curious it's one of the ones that we

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,900
always wonder what's going on while I'm

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,089
asleep what's happening and people show

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,889
a lot of interest here here's some of my

00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:16,670
sleep data you can see that I'm sleeping

00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:18,619
around 6 hours asleep per night most

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,380
people should get 6 to 9 hours I was

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,970
averaging about 6 if you miss it a good

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,279
night of sleep you're 4 to 5 times more

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,570
likely to catch a cold and that was

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,390
happening a lot here this data is from

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,970
earlier this year I got sick four times

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,900
in four months and because it was simply

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,620
because I wasn't sleeping I kept

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,540
catching a cold

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,820
wasn't getting better so the idea here

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,579
is to sleep more consistently and it's

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,079
extremely important our immune system is

00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,010
completely impaired if you don't sleep

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,890
enough there's a book by Matthew Walker

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,570
called why we sleep and if you take a

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,920
vaccination when you have missed

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,410
sleeping well your autoimmune response

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,340
is decreased by 50% so it's basically

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,190
pointless for you taking that

00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:02,750
vaccination for like the flu and stuff

00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,900
like that not vaccinations in general so

00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,370
here's a graph of my sleep data you can

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,410
see that my heart rate bottoms out here

00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,180
when I'm asleep and that's when the

00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,100
ideal time to measure resting heart rate

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,110
resting heart rate is when your body's

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,820
completely at rest and you can see a few

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,040
spots there where my heart rate ticks up

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,060
and that's doing we reckon I'm gonna be

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,830
talking about that next

00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,180
laying out the data here it's pretty

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,560
clear what's going on my heart rate

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,450
immediately takes up the second I wake

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,430
up activity so there's three types of

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,860
activity that you kind of can work out

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,600
here volleyball for me is generally more

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,730
flatline and playing center so I'm not

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,080
moving as much you can see that my heart

00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,730
rate response graph is a bit different

00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,290
from when I'm at the gym and the second

00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,910
second graph here you could see I did a

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,020
bit of hit interval training towards the

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,240
end of the workout and the recovery

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,650
flatlines afterwards softball you're

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,120
coming in and off on anything so you can

00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,410
see the heart rate response reflects

00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,850
what you're actually doing and that's

00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,050
important for when you're training and

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,940
trying to target some type of goal

00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,400
whether you hate to be more you need to

00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:03,560
gain more strength or more endurance

00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,760
these fall into a few zones vo2 max is

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,160
when you're at working at your maximum

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,140
capacity peak effort you can't really

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,630
last there too long some trainers tend

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,190
to push that a little bit more anaerobic

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,930
training is the next set where you're

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,730
doing like we're lifting way

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,140
which calls lactate to form your body

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,620
you can't sustain that from very long

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,170
either

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,280
endurance training and stamina zones for

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,500
when you're trying to focus on weight

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,719
loss and increased capacity and training

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,829
and obviously recovery and warm-up or

00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,430
when you're ramping up and ramping down

00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,430
from those zones

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,450
