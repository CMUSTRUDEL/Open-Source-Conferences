hi good morning Ã¶zkan wow it's so great

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,110
to be back here and to be back in

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,510
Portland how exciting is it but we're

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,100
actually celebrating the 20th birthday

00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:28,769
of open source this year and and we're

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:33,000
also celebrating the birthday of OSI so

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:39,229
very quickly hands up hands up all of

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,229
you who think that open source has won

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,170
okay that's a big part of the room

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,479
that's really great so you know open

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,670
source has been silently and disrupting

00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,839
the software industry for over a period

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,659
of 20 years and when we see a lot of

00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:59,129
articles like open sources eating the

00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,309
software world we've been seeing these

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:05,670
for many years it's everywhere it's in

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:11,310
all of our devices and it's across all

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,869
market sectors as well and the data from

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,469
these are from the Linux Foundation

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,070
shows that there's momentum and you know

00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:22,890
for example the 78 million and repos on

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,990
github and projects are just growing and

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,479
it's a scale that we're working at as a

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,270
community so coming back to the question

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,320
that I asked earlier has open-source

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,759
really won

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,460
well reality is that most of the world's

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,789
consumes open source and most of them

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,609
don't actually know that open source is

00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:48,659
everywhere but it's kept a big secret

00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:51,479
and every company out there building

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,100
services in the cloud for customers or

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,460
whether it's government digitizing

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,100
services for citizens are consuming open

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,889
source software so you know have we

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,770
crossed the chasm for open source well

00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:07,200
my answer is yes we have in some areas

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,590
we certainly have for consumption and

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,090
usage of open source but have we for

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,090
contributions

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,760
so you know we've captured the early

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,100
adopters and we've captured the next set

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,710
of followers see when I ask an audience

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,140
a technical audience that are not an

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,840
open-source event how many are

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,700
contributors is less than 10% of the

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,530
hands actually go up when I talk to

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,480
customers and I talked to the enterprise

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,580
and government the number is even

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,290
smaller and we have a long way to go and

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,150
you know that's a lot of willingness

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,090
there there is a lot of willingness to

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,970
engage and a desire to really get

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,370
involved and grow and participate it's a

00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:57,200
tremendous opportunity for open-source

00:02:52,370 --> 00:03:01,640
communities and you know as the next

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,600
wave we see certainly at AWS we see at

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,420
an inflection point in companies moving

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,100
to the cloud certainly more more

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,440
recently in the last 12 months and

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,090
they're all building services in the

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,660
cloud and they're all future

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,120
contributors of our projects and we see

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,540
this next wave of contributors heading

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,930
towards open source and as communities

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,780
and project leads we want all of you to

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,170
be ready and engage how we know best

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,500
right so in support of that we're

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,100
actually produced a a booklet here with

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,410
O'Reilly Media and sponsored by AWS it's

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,840
been co-authored with Andy arm who

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,030
should be in the audience here somewhere

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,700
and it's called open source in the

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,590
enterprise and we're releasing it today

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,030
and there's a copy available for

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,820
download as well on our website so who

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,340
is it for I'm it's for everybody it's in

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,130
support of organizations that want to

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,160
engage more fully with open source and

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,970
the open source community here you'll

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,489
explore ways in which you know you can

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,400
contribute to open source how you

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,140
consume open source how you use it how

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,539
you do this in a more sustainable way

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,450
how you can release your open source

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,790
projects as well and just why

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,920
organizations you know large

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,020
small-sized organizations have

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,860
strategies or should have strategies for

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,320
free and open-source software there's a

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,870
lot of resources filled from the

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,910
community and some of these are you know

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,750
my favorite authors as well and you'll

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,450
be familiar with some of them what can

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,360
you do well there's four governments and

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,760
enterprise you can download the book let

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,670
us know what you think and ask the

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,130
community for help if you are a project

00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,320
keep your documentation up to scratch

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,710
your to-do list and do all of your

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,540
housekeeping and have mentors ready this

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,270
is where you go to collect the book open

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,270
source to amazon.com and it's also

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:14,660
available at the booth just one last

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,030
thing we actually we built the software

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,760
and these are all the things that we do

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:25,070
as a community it really takes a village

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:28,100
in open-source and we've got to be ready

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:31,130
to catch this wave and to support this

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,060
new group of users are you ready thank

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,769
