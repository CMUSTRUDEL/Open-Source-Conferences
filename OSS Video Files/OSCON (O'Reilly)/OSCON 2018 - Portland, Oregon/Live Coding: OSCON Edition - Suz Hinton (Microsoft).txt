Title: Live Coding: OSCON Edition - Suz Hinton (Microsoft)
Publication date: 2018-07-18
Playlist: OSCON 2018 - Portland, Oregon
Description: 
	Live coding sounds really scary, but it’s a fear worth conquering. To show how fun it can really be, Suz Hinton rolls the dice and live-codes an entertaining hardware solution in front of your eyes. To make things interesting, she’ll start with some randomly assigned inputs and outputs. The challenge is to have a working set of code inside 10 minutes that completes the assigned mission. Join in to find out if Suz has what it takes.

okay cool let's do this one so this is a

00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,620
light sensor we have lots of love light

00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:12,280
on this stage so that's why I think it's

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,380
going to be good and a servo the servo

00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,059
is like kind of like a little motor and

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,619
so you'll see what I'm gonna do with the

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,910
server in a minute so what we want to do

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:21,699
is you want to use a light sensor to

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,710
then trigger a servo to actually start

00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,960
doing things and I'm gonna try and greet

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,320
you and welcome you to a scone given

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,150
that this is the opening talk so alright

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,250
I have to hook up a light sensor and a

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,989
servo alright let's do this so if we can

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,239
get the camera over and then I'm gonna

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,250
use my backup camera just in case but if

00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,680
you come over here and have a look at

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,809
what I'm actually putting together okay

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,429
so I have my Arduino now I don't need

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:46,539
any of these ridiculous wires now

00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,460
because I'm not actually using this

00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:51,070
tried to prepare myself ahead of time

00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,710
alright so I have this ambient light

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:58,480
sensor here it's a tiny tiny little one

00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:02,769
and I also need to use a resistor with

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,930
it so I'm gonna use that all right just

00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:06,579
give me one sec I'm not sure if you can

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,790
see this oh you know what getting in

00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:12,009
close alright so next thing I need is

00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,409
the servo as well alright so the servo

00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:17,259
is actually going to go straight into my

00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,610
odds we know so I can cheat so actually

00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,680
I might just put this in ground and

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:26,140
power in here because I'm gonna need to

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:28,149
share those and I'm gonna choose pin 10

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,530
that's mostly an arbitrary decision so

00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:31,450
don't stress out if you sort of don't

00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,799
know a lot about hardware because I'm

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,930
actually here to just show you that I

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,329
can actually do it in 10 minutes

00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:43,180
I hope let's actually start a clock just

00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:45,070
to add some extra pressure all right all

00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,560
right let's get this shaky hands out now

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,030
cuz I'm really feeling it yeah alright

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,820
so what I'm doing is I'm actually giving

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,500
the breadboard a source of power so that

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,149
you know multiple things can share that

00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,549
so I'm just plugging it into literally

00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:02,350
the ground and the power pin on the

00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:03,909
Arduino itself so this kind of stuff is

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,530
literally like paint-by-numbers if you

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,210
can follow any kind of open source

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,739
hardware guide online the board I'm

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,149
using today is actually open source as

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,310
code nods we know if you haven't heard

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,750
of it and you can literally download the

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,860
schematics of it and you can order your

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,600
own board if you actually

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,130
know which websites to go to without

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,330
even like buying one yourself so I think

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,890
that's really really awesome

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,450
alright so the next thing I need is a

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:29,530
couple of extra leads what am i doing

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:33,700
let's take three of these so I need to

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,300
give something power so we have the

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,100
power on this side yes I think that is

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,990
right so I have a little cheat sheet

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:46,780
just in case I get stuck all right sooo

00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:49,390
powers on this side and we have signal

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:54,640
and then I'm gonna plug this in to

00:02:49,390 --> 00:03:00,540
ground all right so let's get started

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:06,790
with this so ground is my green one and

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:09,209
my power it's the blue one oh my god I'm

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,170
so nervous

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,490
alright so here we go power and the

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,170
annow signal is actually going to go

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,640
straight into the Arduino so I'm gonna

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,320
put it into one of my analog pins

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,850
because this isn't an analog sensor and

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,110
then hopefully I'll move the Y's out of

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,000
the way so that there's actually a

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:27,660
little bit of light now I have this

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,970
little hand that's actually gonna wave

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,540
hello as kind that's what I chose for

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,540
the server okay

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,470
