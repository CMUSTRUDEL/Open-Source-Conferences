hi I'm Roger Margolis I'm here at OSCON

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,529
in Portland Oregon

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,420
20:18 enjoying a beautiful day in the

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:13,920
Northwest and I'm here with Thomas

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,920
grassle from s AP hi Tom hi Roger so we

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,390
know that s AP is working with a lot of

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,480
big companies that's really what you're

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,460
most known for but how is how do you see

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,250
open source being adopted in those

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,960
enterprises cool who probably were not

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,570
reluctant but probably surprised that

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,850
this turn of events yeah for a lot of

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,190
the the big companies big corporation

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,440
like I remember like four or five years

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,629
back they came to us a lot with a lot of

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,610
question like how should we how can we

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,440
help them like to get into open source

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,930
what should they do like how do they

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,390
should set up the legal frameworks a lot

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,399
of detailed questions what I see now

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,920
like over the last years like all the

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,660
open sources they're like small

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,899
companies big companies they are

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,910
increasing open source they have done a

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,129
good job on like really learning about

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,199
and I think like events like Costco not

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,619
really important for them to come in and

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,000
learn about it so we still get a lot of

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,900
question but now they're more detailed

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so it's going into security like how do

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,520
I manage like what open source projects

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,950
I have in my company so a lot of these

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,110
next level detail questions are now

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,729
coming up but in general the good thing

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,009
is like we see it open source is

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,850
embraced by the companies it also helps

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,009
us with our strategy because we also are

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,530
betting on open source a lot in in the

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,380
solutions we are offering and that's

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,759
also gives to the customers a good

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,950
transparency what we are doing with the

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,899
help and like we've also the help of

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,149
dopant source community so that's that's

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,799
the moving in there do you see any kind

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,549
of change in enthusiasm from them I mean

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,399
they're more interested about like like

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,340
a few years back it was like more they

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,290
could I get all keen grassroots from the

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,180
developer community they brought in the

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,950
open source projects and most of the

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,079
questions we got was from the developers

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,780
and said can you help us how you guys

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,509
worked it through with you legal and how

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,580
do you set this up so the enthusiasm was

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,210
there now think it's what happens like

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,030
it is established

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:20,260
and now the developers are looking for

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,610
what are the next thing hmm so-so si P

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,070
is involved in lots of open-source

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,050
projects but what does your what does sa

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,260
piece focus these days yeah so open

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,490
source is embedded in in our strategy

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,700
definitely with a lot of like software

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,850
products which on the one hand consume

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,960
open source products but for us it's

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:44,530
open off like always a big thing is like

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:47,380
if we take on open source projects like

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,810
we do have in most cases of special

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,900
requirements so for us open source is

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,690
not just a consumption we really looking

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,790
at all the different projects and also

00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,890
engaging with them so contribution is a

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,310
very big aspect for the open source

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,960
projects we are taking in and so that's

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,850
why we're working like with Cloud

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,510
Foundry foundation with the kubernetes

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:13,060
team and so on so there there's a lot of

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,300
like these things happening and then

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,430
also for us another thing is we started

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,370
initially like very small like in in

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,910
contribution of our own projects but

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,770
that area is growing so it's - two

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,400
things what we see is like one is like

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:35,070
bigger projects what we are pushing out

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,070
so that's from UI frameworks to

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,570
libraries for for data access and so on

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,340
- even like very small projects and and

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,210
it's mostly done internally it's also

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,620
driven by our developers and like in the

00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,270
collaboration with the open source

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,850
community like these projects are

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,010
getting good good traction and becoming

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,390
bigger and that's great to see is that

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,850
is any of the impetus come from your

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:04,060
customers so there's definitely a lot of

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,790
light coming from our customers like one

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,030
project we we were very much like active

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,090
or voice on the UI 5 like we have

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,800
standards for our UI frameworks and that

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,110
project is called open UI 5

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,420
and we open sourced it because the

00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,180
customer said we want to work with the

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,360
same components in our frameworks for

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,760
our application and can we open sources

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,250
and initially was more for the AP

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,670
customer base but now it's it's also

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,220
happening that non-si few customers are

00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:40,220
picking up this frameworks so open UI 5

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,500
is framework initially we released it

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,410
for our customers because they had to

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,480
demand they said ASAP is providing their

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,730
application with a certain look and feel

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,440
great framework can we use the same

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,600
framework for our custom build

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,300
applications so that was the initial

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,250
thing that's why we open sourced it but

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,010
now we see more and more demand for it

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,980
we're also expanding this framework so

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,620
it is no longer just like applicable to

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,690
build it within the open UI 5 framework

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,970
and use these controls there's over 200

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,560
controls in there so we can also like in

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,780
the future use it from other frameworks

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,800
like angular and that you can imagine

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:21,560
like 200 controls like they're fully

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,500
localized accessibility features

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,420
embedded in there that is it's

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,370
definitely a big big project where we

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,200
see in situ action in the market or in

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,480
the in the open-source community right

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,240
now great you find your customers are

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,360
all contributing as well so customers I

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,960
get like biggest contribution is on

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,970
feature requests and like initially but

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,820
I mean when they see that we're taking

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,970
this series like it's not only the

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,530
issues they put out I think like we get

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,400
recommendation and there's definitely

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,840
other groups who start with complete

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,570
open source projects on their own and

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,570
even for areas where you would not

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,010
expect it I guess if he has has their

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,770
own language it's called

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,140
ABAB it's a huge developer community

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:12,200
over like over a million developers out

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,780
there and they're looking into open

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,610
source so we have a group of in the

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,950
community who really started out like

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,550
how can I share or about via github and

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,470
building integration tools for this so

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,510
it's great to see like this this motion

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,730
and and the engagement from the

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,040
customers and in the end I call so from

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,690
the developers were driving it right so

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,360
you explain a lot about open UI five I

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,550
understand CLA assist is also getting a

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,130
lot of attention so CLA assist is like

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:45,560
it's there was this tiny tiny projects

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:47,850
for us because we also had to deal with

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,250
contribute to license agreement and you

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,560
can imagine like in the beginning it was

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,540
a pain for us and for everybody who

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,390
wanted to contribute and then I think

00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:00,390
one or two folks developers in in inside

00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:02,790
ASAP said let's make the digital like

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,490
let's have this on on github if someone

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:08,730
wants to sign the agreement that can be

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,310
all done digital on on github and so we

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,440
open-source this from the get-go and a

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,880
lot of customers out there now are using

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,190
over in the open-source communities

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,130
using it I know Microsoft is using it I

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,110
wrote a blog about it recently so we're

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,240
seeing a lot of traction on this one and

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,640
it's also great like to have like these

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,470
small projects and I mean here at the

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,030
booth like everyone's like I heard about

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,950
it I didn't know what new it's from I

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,560
say P that CLA assistance oh it's great

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,000
to build this out it's good so another

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,080
project that I've heard some about is

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,560
called gardener

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,890
yeah tell me about that so a gardener is

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,140
is very new like like here ah scone and

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,840
everywhere else like everybody's talking

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,540
about kubernetes and for us is those

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,290
like we have kubernetes we we host a lot

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,720
of our applications through containers

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,530
and kubernetes plays a big role but for

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,330
us it's also the scale again so we have

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,310
not to manage like one or two classes

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,320
it's like landscapes of card clusters

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,080
that's also where the name gardener

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,030
comes here like landscapes like so you

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,290
can imagine like to build up these

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,790
different clusters over different

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,949
infrastructure providers so this can be

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,530
by AWS adder

00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:25,439
Google cloud platform or your private

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,810
cloud like my OpenStack so Gardner

00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,810
basically helps you to manage these

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,079
clusters like updates these clusters and

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,820
thank you have a central few even if

00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:38,399
that's running on different cloud

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,310
providers so this was another project

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,440
where we intentionally like initially

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,870
always said like we need to make this

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,490
open-source because we need the

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,800
infrastructure providers they are very

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,260
interested to contribute so we're

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,140

but open-source helps a lot yeah it's

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,160
new but for what it's worth my own

analytics I do it or Riley kubernetes is

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,890
