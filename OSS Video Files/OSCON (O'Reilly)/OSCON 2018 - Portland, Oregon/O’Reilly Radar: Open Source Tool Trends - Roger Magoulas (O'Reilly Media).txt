hi everyone let me just say the non

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,940
technical stuff on Safari is great it's

00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:14,389
all photography and managing your money

00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,369
and stuff so as Rachel said I work on

00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,200
radar and that's where we kind of assess

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,810
the world of technology and figure out

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,730
technology's impact on the world we have

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,449
a history of doing this we've done from

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,519
open-source web 2.0 big data which turn

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,919
to the strata conference DevOps the

00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,870
stuff Tim is doing around WTF the next

00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,300
economy this is all like what comes out

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,039
of radar and what we're doing with radar

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,699
is we're trying to provoke discussion

00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,980
you know create community and extend the

00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:44,660
O'Reilly mission of spreading the

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,160
knowledge of innovators and that's why

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,010
we're sharing this kind of thing with

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,980
you guys I've been coming to ascom since

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,379
2003 so I've been very involved in this

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,809
kind of open-source community and I've

00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:00,649
been here through peak t-shirt Pete

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,300
pearl peak beard it's great to see how

00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,180
it's changed and as you'll see in these

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,560
slides we've got even more changes

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,400
coming up so gonna be showing some trend

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,799
analysis from our internal systems in

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,780
looking at emerging topics so the thing

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm going to really show is Safari that

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,909
Rachel was just talking about you get

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,829
the free subscription to and we use this

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,320
as one of our measures we do all sorts

00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,579
of qualitative and quantitative work to

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,810
figure out what's going on this is an

00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,009
important one to us

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,890
and what I'm going to be showing is

00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,899
search data and content data and they're

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,759
a little bit different search is really

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,280
good for like kind of what's happening

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,960
now but there isn't as much measure of

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,600
engagement where the usage stuff

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,560
measures the kind of intensity of things

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,700
working so that's what we like to

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,189
combine the two things together so what

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,719
is Safari we know that other cars lot of

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,549
people don't really know what it is or

00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,439
think it is just an online bookstore but

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,820
it really is as a learning resource and

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,250
that's the URL for it

00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,490
it's got 50,000 titles across all sorts

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,229
of formats we got text video and audio a

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,570
lot of interactive things around Jupiter

00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,430
notebooks and real online training where

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,039
you're doing it live with a with an

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,940
instructor instructor so sign up and

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,500
check it out on the platform and this is

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,490
the context you need to kind of

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,070
understand the data

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,620
we have about two and a half million

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,150
licensed users 50-100 different group

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,970
licenses so this is where there's more

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,820
than one person at the company 30% of

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,160
the Fortune 1000 is on it and 60% of the

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,090
customers are bigger than 10,000 people

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,970
companies we also have 68,000 individual

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,530
subscribers from all over and as Iran

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,640
they're doing both kind of linear and

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,780
nonlinear work you know there's

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,490
sometimes engaged and trying to learn

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,170
something from start to finish they're

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:51,350
also trying to ask questions and that's

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:52,880
relevant to search so the people come

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,340
from many different industries but the

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,620
top four represent you know where most

00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,060
people are coming from and the

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,370
consulting people are obviously working

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,170
for other folks and doing all sorts of

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,010
industries so we have a pretty wide

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:09,140
spread of people who are using it but

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,400
having said that as you look at the data

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,340
and you think about what I'm showing

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,680
it's probably Enterprise biased you also

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,720
have to think about the maturity of the

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,710
technology we're talking about because

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,780
the newer thing just needs more

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,000
mindshare to figure out we're something

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,470
that's been around for a while a lot of

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,350
people already know what the maturity

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,620
takes some of the time away people need

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:33,440
to look I don't mention that tech takes

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,020
time the emerging time is very long

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,290
sometimes and as I show things pay

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,460
attention to the scale of what I'm

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,920
showing so you'll see that I've got a

00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,210
lot of bars going across and it'll help

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,840
to give you a sense of how big something

00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:50,930
is and I also want to mention quickly on

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,810
search it's really a longtail data set

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,370
we've had 1.2 million different search

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,430
terms the first six months of the year

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,850
I'm only looking at the top bunch but

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,320
there's a lot of very specific questions

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,870
in there so I'm gonna look at top

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,410
searches the top topics programming

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,530
languages and a little on MLA I so here

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,000
are the top 14 topics I just want to

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,250
explain what you're seeing is first you

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,640
see the rank you know which is the most

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,190
searched term whether the rank changed

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,890
from this year to last year the red bars

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,419
are the order of magnitude so you can

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,990
see that python is much bigger than

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,340
spring and then the bars of the right

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,830
are

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,270
the rate of change year-over-year so I

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,060
compared the first six months of last

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:40,120
year to this year on it so this style of

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,190
slide will be all through it but and

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,660
while I'm showing a lot of charts I will

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,389
kind of wrap this up in a nice package

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,460
so that you'll get the main results the

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,590
two kind of most surprising things and

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,600
surprises the friend of all analysts are

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,940
kubernetes and blockchain with big

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,710
growth maybe they're not a surprise

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,410
because they're both interesting topics

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,180
but I'm gonna bring up kubernetes at the

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,740
end because I think it's an important

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,900
part of a hypothesis we're starting to

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,860
draw from this data now if you're

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,160
looking through the list you'll probably

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,440
say gee you got spring in Java we've got

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,180
three different JavaScript things maybe

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,040
you should group those together and if

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,740
we do what we find this Java Script is

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,660
most popular and then Java comes in

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,710
second now the one thing I want to note

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,389
here because I'm going to tie this

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,090
together is that javascript is a little

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,330
down we're Java and Python are up and

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,380
remember this is in search and we think

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,060
that's going to point to something that

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,750
I set up I'll bring up when I go through

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:39,820
the usage data next now if we look at

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:42,550
the top programming languages the ones

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,830
that we think are kind of emergent here

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,780
are go and Kotlin they're both kind of

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,220
growing they're not as big you can tell

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,229
from the rank and the magnitudes that

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,060
they're a little smaller but the growth

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:54,220
shows that there is a kind of increased

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,389
interest in them if we go further down

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:01,270
the list what we find is rust growing

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,860
pretty well and see with some surprising

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:07,180
strengths now we're not really sure

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:11,020
what's behind that but I started off as

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,190
a seed programmer so I love C but with

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,050
some things they might be going on there

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,030
is out around ml there's a lot of people

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,270
we're using the Python bindings and so

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,639
forth to use ml they are also writing

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,229
some of those other code and see now

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,169
that one thing that as someone who's

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,889
been here for so long is seeing PHP Ruby

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,220
and Perl

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:33,460
kind of lower down in the list I

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,520
remember one time in like 2005 when

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:39,310
Guido from Python and Larry well from

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,770
Perl and maths from Ruby we're walking

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,360
down the street here and in such intense

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,159
conversation they almost got hit by a

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,129
tram

00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:52,379
and I was thinking wow if that happened

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:54,449
there goes open-source but this is

00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,569
thought things have changed a lot so I

00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,580
think this shows what's going on now in

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,019
ml clearly this is a very hype subject

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,300
but I think it's a real subject and lots

00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:06,089
going on we're already seeing maturity

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,550
around stuff like tensorflow having a

00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:10,409
bit of a decline and things like Hera

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,360
spy torch and reinforcement learning

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,559
getting the strength and we think those

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,189
are three things that are really worth

00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:19,439
paying attention to now we're going to

00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,539
about usage usage means how much people

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,869
are engaged in the actual content so

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,159
like measuring what people are reading

00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:29,189
and we're going to kind of cover similar

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:31,349
topics now and I wish I had said this

00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:34,110
before on the search side every one of

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:37,469
those topics in that top 14 was open

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:40,169
source or open source dominated and even

00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:42,179
here three of the subjects are open

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,789
source and for the 11 of them are

00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:47,459
dominated by open source so I mean seven

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,559
of the top 11 things people are using

00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:54,300
are basically in the open source realm

00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:56,519
and not a surprise in some ways but AWS

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,889
and the cloud and further research

00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,889
showed that the cloud stuff is important

00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,449
in other topic areas surprising strength

00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,740
giving how long has been around it's

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,199
almost acting like an emergent

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,759
technology we think the cloud has a lot

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,829
of legs and we'll be taking a lot of

00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,869
time to unfold

00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,729
I think we as companies figure out what

00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:19,949
they can do or what they can't do around

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:21,389
it and ml and AI it's a big subject now

00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,889
I mean this is a these are the top

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,839
things people are looking at and it's

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,490
the fourth biggest thing and it's gone

00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,110
up three things I think it shows that

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,329
there is some strength and people are

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,589
making a pretty big commitment to it we

00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,810
look at the programming languages you

00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:36,089
see very similar patterns in this case

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,630
Java up with pretty good growth year

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:42,990
over year same languages are showing

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:48,360
some growth further down the list with

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:50,670
go Kotlin and rust in usage both

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,230
kubernetes and blockchain are up quite a

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,209
bit these are for us this was pretty big

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,680
growth particular block chain of four

00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,570
and a half percent what's interesting

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,699
about blockchain is that

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,509
it's not only up it's up a lot more than

00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:05,040
bitcoin is so our community is really

00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:07,199
thinking about it from a development

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,769
standpoint and not and I see what he

00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:12,800
called IPOs whatever the investment

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:17,639
thing that people do with that bitcoin

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,399
so to wrap things up open-source is a

00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,579
really big topic all in search terms is

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,959
all open source even in usage real thing

00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:30,269
of open source and languages we saw that

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,149
three languages being at the top Python

00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,589
JavaScript and Java and a little bit

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,509
different patterns where Java and Python

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,300
are growing JavaScript shrinking a

00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,339
little re-emphasize that ml and AI is a

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,399
major topic and if the cloud is showing

00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,920
these long legs now here's where this is

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,410
what radar does we see this data we see

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,899
that kubernetes is well up we know that

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,670
MicroStrategy at micro-services is

00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,490
something that is important we think

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,440
this points to something going on is

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,050
that these it's kind of a next

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,880
architecture hypothesis that because of

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,130
micro-services because of containers

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,329
kubernetes as a manifestation that

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,730
people are really implementing these

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:11,160
things that that's what's moving to

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,329
other languages from javascript so if

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,829
you have an opinion on that you should

00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:17,579
let me know

00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:19,470
and with blockchain it is clear that a

00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:21,870
lot of people are paying attention to it

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,120
we see it both in search and usage if

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,889
you thought the Bitcoin world is silly

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,480
or whatever it might be time to start

00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,040
thinking about blockchain as a different

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,279
thing that a distributed ledger might be

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,600
something worth your time and thinking

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,240
about how a might interface with what

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,940
your you're doing so I've thrown up a

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,850
lot of data if you have any questions or

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,230
comment you can email me or just stop me

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,940
while I'm walking around thanks for your

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,709
attention

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,709
[Applause]

00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,389
