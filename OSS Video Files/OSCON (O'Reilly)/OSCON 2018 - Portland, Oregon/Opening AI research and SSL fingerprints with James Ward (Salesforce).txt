hi I'm Roger McGough Louis here at osku

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,540
in Portland 2018 I'm here with Jim Ward

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,290
who's at Salesforce

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,570
yeah and Salesforce at OSCON yeah a

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,160
little more about that yeah yeah so I

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,410
run the open source program at

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,840
Salesforce and trying to help our

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,939
engineers do open source we do a lot of

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,710
open source and so we really just have

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,689
our engineers here showing off the open

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,000
source that they do and whether it's

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,740
contributing to external projects or

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,359
whether it's taking something that

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,000
they've built internally and open

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,750
sourcing it we we have them here to show

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,130
all that off

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,960
Wow so you're really in a kind of a

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,800
proactive State about an open source

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,469
there's nothing you're more in the

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,540
giving phase than in the but we

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,670
definitely take a lot but but we're

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,489
trying to give back as well so so yeah

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,530
we consume tons of open source and and

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,140
there's a lot of cases where we don't

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,850
want to pay that for tax where we fork

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,250
something internally and make changes

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,710
and then don't ever contribute back

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,079
because then we're just stuck on old

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,809
versions and and that there's a tax to

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,580
that and so so we're trying to

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,860
contribute back our changes and and make

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,990
things better for everyone to the

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,970
external project so we've done that two

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,159
projects like Kafka and kubernetes and

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,409
tons of other ones oh great Larry sounds

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
like this some of the big ones there so

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,770
what what's kind of the new and exciting

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,540
stuff that you're doing an open source

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,950
at Salesforce yeah there's there's a few

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,710
areas that have been really interesting

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,780
lately we are research a I research team

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,490
has been open sourcing a lot of their

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,530
projects so there's there's just one

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,720
that it's like a quasi recurrent neural

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,689
network thing that I don't understand at

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,180
all but is is yeah exactly

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,710
and so the AI researchers are doing some

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,450
really interesting things and then open

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,490
source in their what they what they've

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,380
discovered and the new ways of doing

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,540
neural networks and that sort of stuff

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,909
and then our security team has been

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,560
doing some great stuff and releasing it

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,579
as open source one of the exciting ones

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,860
is one called ja3 ja3 and it's cool

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,170
because that fingerprints TLS clients so

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,329
in a TLS connection is made it creates a

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,729
fingerprint based on the connection

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,630
information and that allows us to more

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,340
easily detect malware clients and

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,350
and malicious clients and because they

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,000
usually use similar fingerprints when

00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,200
they connect and so that's something we

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,209
open sourced and that one's getting

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,850
broadly so that's that's a pretty cool

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,690
just because you're a SAS company how

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,760
how is that playing up someone's there

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,900
their computer on the other end yeah is

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,180
it through yes so the way that I think

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,500
that we use it is that that somewhere in

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,690
our network connection pathway we do the

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,640
TLS fingerprinting and have a database

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,560
of malicious clients and then can just

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,269
immediately deny the connections from

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,910
the ones that we think are malicious so

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:48,340
yeah so that's obviously like is a

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,010
service that a SAS can provide is you

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,800
know to help keep things safe and secure

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,420
and Trust is our number one value so all

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,860
right makes total sense yep yeah and

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,040
that's a great project to share because

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,200
the more people that use it and and give

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,700
us better fingerprint information and

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,190
share that fingerprint information the

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,540
the better we can be at denying the bad

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,730
guys right sounds like a classic

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,920
open-source story and that the network

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,170
effect exactly proves everything that's

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,530
right yeah for you and for the people

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,090
who exactly that's great so how are how

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,200
are people ad sales for is able to

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,930
contribute is this something that

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,700
self-selected do they how do you get

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,130
involved in the open-source efforts yeah

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,900
so we we have processes being a large

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,420
company that promises that our engineers

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,620
have to use in order to contribute to

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,930
open source and whether it's

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,940
contributing a bug fix or a feature to

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,890
an external project or taking something

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,510
that they've built internally we have

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,930
processes that they go through to do

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,730
that and so we the team that I'm on

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,109
manages those processes and helps the

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,609
engineers through those processes and

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:49,810
there's legal approvals and security

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:51,670
approvals and all that kind of stuff and

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,829
we try to make it as frictionless as

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,390
possible and and so that's great but one

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,829
of the the things that I really like

00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,390
about what we're doing is we at

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,810
Salesforce are really big on

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,340
philanthropy and try to actually all

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,190
every employee at Salesforce is

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,440
encouraged to do 56 hours a year of what

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,380
we call volunteer time off and so this

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,910
is you can pick your pick your project

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,890
that you want to be involved in and and

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,870
get paid to actually go volunteer for

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,250
those projects it's actually really cool

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,900
that open-source is actually something

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,419
you can do

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,550
is part of your volunteer time off so we

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,350
actually encourage our engineers to get

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,300
out there and contribute to open sources

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,830
as part of that that's great so your

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,820
vacation room coding is to do some

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,020
coding but it sounds like a great I know

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,850
that when you're doing something for

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,610
yeah the greater good it just always

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,860
feels great yeah yeah and I you know I

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,990
do some some of that myself but I also

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,460
help build trails around where I live in

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,500
Crested Butte and so it's fun to be able

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,820
to get paid to go build trails and then

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,669
I get to mount my that sounds great

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,919
it'll serve in but I think the payoff to

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,020
everyone involved is probably way more

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,590
than exactly a cost yeah

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,990
so you've got a VTO thing yeah that's a

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,400
volunteer time off yeah okay yeah yeah

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,710
so that's part of our what we call the

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,110
one one one model of philanthropy where

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,000
we do one percent of our equity one

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,340
percent of our time and one percent of

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,410
our product we give away to you to

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,820
nonprofit so that's what the the

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,849
open-source is covered under that

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,710
one-on-one mano right and what was kind

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,349
of your path to open-source where you'd

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,020
be in this kind of role yeah so I've

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:26,639
been an engineer for a long time and I

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,940
always been passionate about open source

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,919
and so so being able to help Salesforce

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,229
do more open source and do it better is

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,349
is a really cool opportunity I've been

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:38,370
in this role for a year and and it's

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,620
great because I still get to write some

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,449
code but then also help our engineers do

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,979
more open source and it's a kind of the

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,970
best of both worlds it's really fun

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,320
sounds great

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,740
well thanks a lot for your time yeah

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,740
