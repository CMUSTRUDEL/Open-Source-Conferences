my favorite quote is by our source Nagar

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,500
when people ask him about being a

00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,219
self-made man he says I am NOT a self

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,709
man self-made man I sit on the I sit on

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,590
the shoulders of giants and that's a lot

00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:21,470
of what we do in open source I myself my

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,960
life has been changed and saved by open

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,179
source when I left the Air Force thing

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,130
in the world was my oyster what happened

00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,679
was I learned quickly during the 8th

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,620
apex of the recession that that was not

00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,590
the case and I had three job options cop

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,590
security guard or go back overseas the

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,969
private military contractor didn't like

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,200
two of those options and other option

00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,579
was even hiring because we were in a

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,739
recession government was how I was I'm

00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,719
hiring cops at that time so I had no

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:49,340
idea what to do saw weird commercial

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,410
about software engineering was like what

00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,710
is this thing what are these geeks on TV

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,449
doing googled it saw something about SQL

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,399
started learning SQL and got my first

00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:03,440
job of departmental security as database

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,360
analyst fast forward from that from 2014

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,330

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,730
in need of someone help them raise money

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,800
to help bury their son who was an Army

00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,240
veteran and a lot of the nonprofits in

00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,310
their local area had already started the

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,230
idea so with nothing more than the

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,470
experience I learned from open source on

00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,850
how to write code and the worst server

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,420
setup you could ever think of

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:30,140
I launched a website and with a GoFundMe

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:33,350

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:48,020
utilize that to get jobs in a software

00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,710
