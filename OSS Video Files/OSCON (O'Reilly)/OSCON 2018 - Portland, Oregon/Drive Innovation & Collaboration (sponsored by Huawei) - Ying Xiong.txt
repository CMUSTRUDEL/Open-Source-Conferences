	00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:06,899
again the my name is Shawn I'm the

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,719
action need a director of a cloud lab

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,889
are away so he's great it was great to

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,440
be here back here

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,629
I always come last year I give a talk

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
about the open source the power of open

00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:18,900
source ecosystems

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,580
over the last year the open source

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,800
community community and the open source

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,590
project has been going explain Tony

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,529
which is great to see of course that's

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,570
not that's not because of my talk it's

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,730
because of the technology and innovation

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,500
that you can see created that actually

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,530
helps the customers to solve the

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,420
customer real problems so today I want

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,829
to share with you some of the projects

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,780
we have been working on with the

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,700
communities give you update of some of

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,250
those projects and also want to share

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,160
with you some of the syncing experience

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,910
we have in how to drive the open source

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,010
collaboration open source innovation

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,109
past few years we have a scene I believe

00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,609
you have seen to you that more than more

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,129
Enterprise embraced open source

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,800
technology and many of the using the

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,330
technology as the infrastructure

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,400
component infrastructure foundation to

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,520
build a technology advantage for the

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,060
business the vini rely on that really

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,700
depends on the open source why because

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,380
they trust the communities they lack the

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,380
collaboration that happens in the

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,540
communities those open source is all

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,750
about community and collaboration as you

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,030
know but however communities not just a

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,830
crowd of individual organization who

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,960
contributed code is more than code

00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,400
contribution it's more than the

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,920
contribution ranking that many people

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,050
see in the communities

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,410
similarly the collaboration is not just

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,600
coordination or cooperation with

00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,340
coordination sometimes imply that is a

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,960
one company at the center and the

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,940
coating them with other companies and

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,980
all individual to achieve a goal but

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,470
that's not the open source way of

00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,510
collaborations we believe the open

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,890
source way of collaboration is centered

00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,840
around the business the problem is

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,210
centered around the technology at

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,740
advantage there people from all over the

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,690
world coming together with trust inspire

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,330
sharing support everything you see in

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,620
this diagrams they working together to

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,180
achieve a common goal which is to solve

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,349
the real piece is a problem for the end

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,900
users or for the communities yourself so

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,270
what does it means to us it means that

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,610
in every community that we have been

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,550
engaged from Linux foundations to

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,800
OpenStack to say safe to attach

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,890
communities we are committed to this

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,510
principle of collaborations open source

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,670
aware of collaborations and there's a

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,290
window from the window for us so I want

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,390
to share with you some one of the

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,269
projects called community open lab and

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:49,480
one of the challenge we continue to see

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:51,640
in the community is the complexities not

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,310
only the individual project itself neck

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,920
of his stag night kubernetes but also

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,920
the complexity of integration among this

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,690
technology so to address these

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,120
challenges promote the collaboration

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,140
among ourselves among our communities

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,269
the community creates opens lab project

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,760
with a vision to be a place for all

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:16,620
open-source community to collaborate to

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,200
integrate and to test the technologies

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,609
so today the community have more than 13

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,070
companies or organizations that

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,590
contributed infrastructure to this lab

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,440
in the supported communities thanks to

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,000
this organization that who made the open

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,209
source of vision open lab vision the

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,370
possible so in this lab you can have

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:40,120
access to hundreds of the devices

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,100
servers GPUs FPGAs and thousands of

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,190
virtual machines also including the

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,600
primal networks which sends a game for

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,090
those organizations that can't rebuild

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,940
the infrastructure to disallow so

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,889
currently we have enabling projects or

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,620
technology deployed on the slab and

00:03:53,889 --> 00:04:00,760
integrate or Gators this including the

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:04,299
bash kubernetes Jenkins and terraform

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,609
and so on the community also wrote more

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,549
than 70 individual tests which you can

00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,260
run to test against you your deployment

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,600
in this lab for your technology you

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,329
choose this number are not big enough

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,039
but we are glad to see the people from

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,660
all different communities the

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,609
commentators collaborate a worker today

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:26,620
to solve the integration problem for the

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:28,420
customers another aspect of open-source

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,570
way of collaborating the engage

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,810
in the user in the communities in fact

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,450
for open source to be successful the

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,760
technology server has to benefit and the

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,530
users so in the user is one of the

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,080
driving force for open source of a of

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,590
collaboration now over STS is one of

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,620
those projects engage in the engage in

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,680
the end users extensively so one of the

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,080
end the user is Yahoo Japan in Yahoo

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,000
Japan as their business to grow the

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,860
private cloud system is getting bigger

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,190
and bigger so one of the challenges they

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,740
have is to they want to synchronize the

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,210
storage access authority management for

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,790
all the different platforms they already

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,240
have in the production so they engaged

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,060
open STS communities extensively so a

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,190
couple weeks ago the open STS community

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,770
released a new version about in STS

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,140
called Aruba release that means unified

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,810
the storage management for kubernetes

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,210
and for the OpenStack into a one single

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,390
platform and replicate data among those

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,910
platforms that exactly solve the

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,970
challenge of the problems for the Yahoo

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,710
jove hand again the end users we need a

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,080
driving force for open source aware of

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,030
collaboration

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,910
let's talking about the innovation we're

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,570
here all the time the open source is the

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:54,670
best platform is the best environment to

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:57,670
innovate right but how how company in

00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,220
the wait for the dishonest if everyone

00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,260
is using the same technology how company

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,390
innovate to divagate themselves from

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,990
others if we're all using the same

00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:10,180
technology you may already been asked by

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,650
your customer the same questions here

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,780
one is here a kebab sauce

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,380
couple of seconds hopefully give your

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:20,350
thinking going in this direction first

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,180
the open source has to move the live our

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,060
planning further for innovation to our

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,760
player nobody can say the open incision

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,800
as a technology advantage anymore right

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,920
the same is true for many open source

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,920
platforms they are no longer consider

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,730
but the vision is to ask the technology

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,340
at the Vantage

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:42,070
so we have this thing a layer higher in

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,770
order to innovate this could be you

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,810
specific industrial domain this crew be

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,400
on top of this in technology for

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,860
integration for management making it

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,120
easy to use making these scalable or

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,770
secure McKay is autumn managed either we

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,800
have to manage thinking about from the

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,170
health at higher levels now another way

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,570
to innovate we found from a customer is

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,760
that the customer fun innovative ways to

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,160
innovate to using the technology to

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,900
solve this pieces of problem wise exam I

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,880
want to share with you is we have one

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,090
customer using the kubernetes the

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,740
manager device now that servers they

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,450
push the container in the device and

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,310
then manage the device from the

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,520
kubernetes castle in the cloud

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,930
that's a innovative way to using the

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,910
technology to solve the business

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,890
problems another common way to innovate

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,050
for many technology companies to do the

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,850
abstract standardize the common problems

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,130
you have the common requirements from

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,930
the customers and the create a new

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,540
technology on top of existing ones

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,880
that's another way to innovate they will

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,100
move the whole open-source to a higher

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,610
level the benefits for Eric benefit

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,800
every business so last thing I want to

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,290
share a project is more innovation

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,480
problems causing I Jeanne and the

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,400
scenario is this we have a quite a few

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,890
customer using the kubernetes like

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,420
everybody do to those days they're using

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,040
the kubernetes to manage the container

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,010
application but they can counter the

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,690
following problems they have application

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,880
has a multiple endpoints so then either

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,350
modify IP address per container which is

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,380
not support in the toilet systems

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,820
because they want the people access to

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,770
the application internally different

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,620
than publicly so they're on multiple IP

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,220
address they also want to come ability

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,990
to configure or apply the different

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,400
solutions for different type of

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,099
occasions that deploy on the same

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,840
clusters whether they want to separate

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,300
the video stream level from other apps

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,390
or whether they just tried to control

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,250
the network access to the control plan

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,599
different in a network a play they want

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,320
to have different network solutions to

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,600
that now we also have an custom actually

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,990
want to a PBX network that coexist with

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,140
ipv4 which is doesn't support today so

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,420
two hand check the problems too

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,730
challenges problems so we create the

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,410
community create a CI genius small

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:06,610
project and in the vision project where

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,840
allow the competitor user to choose and

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,580
the configure different necklace

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,920
solutions at a time I we deploy your

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,050
application at the wrong time that

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,030
allowed the customers to deploy

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,160
different networks for the application

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,050
that has the same clusters they sent

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,640
different address and then these we can

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,650
choose the Fernando's Kanako's or ganas

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,030
again is this more innovation project by

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,330
really solve the real business of

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:34,150
problems finally I want to end my talk

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,520
with this quote that most people know to

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,530
leave is to change the world and those

00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,380
who are crazy enough to think they can

00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,480
change the world the usually do I think

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,240
that the open source is the best

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,080
platform to do that thank you hope you

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,119
enjoy the conference

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,119
[Applause]

00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,050
