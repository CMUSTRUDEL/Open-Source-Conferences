	00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:08,080
now I want to try and teach you a little

00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,760
bit about quantum in a few minutes and I

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,800
was looking around and trying to find

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,870
the best picture that I could think of

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,330
that explained what the popular press

00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,330
described quantum and everywhere I look

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,080
everywhere I look it says there's

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,330
something like a live and a dead cat and

00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,280
this picture looks like the best example

00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,150
of a cat that is both dead and alive at

00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:35,620
the same time and there's lots of magic

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:39,039
around it and I think this is because we

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,289
really try to over analogize and we try

00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,969
to make an analogy for what quantum is

00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:46,870
and we don't experience quantum effects

00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:50,289
so rather than make an analogy I would

00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,420
rather try and be very precise of what

00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,089
is different and then try and show

00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:00,609
through some examples so quantum

00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:03,309
computing is very much like classical

00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:06,039
computing you have to initialize your

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:08,380
system you have to go do some operations

00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:10,090
we call them gates and then you have to

00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,119
extract information we call this

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,000
measurement but there's two things that

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,189
are very different and the first is this

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,969
concept that something that is in a

00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,890
definite state can still behave randomly

00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:26,200
okay that sounds a bit strange but I'll

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,119
try and show later the second is that

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,250
two things that are too far apart and

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,100
they're individually random so they have

00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,170
no information in them their correlation

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,060
when you bring them together can have

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,329
more information so the whole is much

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:43,450
harder the bigger than the part so let's

00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:45,280
try and demonstrate the first one the

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,380
only way I know how by coming up with a

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,469
simple coin flip experiment and then

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,770
doing it through quiz kit so first we're

00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:56,229
going to import all the things that are

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,450
needed so here's a simple circuit this

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,179
circuit starts by declaring a quantum

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,030
register a classical register of size 1

00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:06,159
and then it declares a quantum circuit

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,840
and then it applies this operation which

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,940
I'm just going to call the coin flip for

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,220
a moment then it measures and then we

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,260
look at the results so what's happening

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,920
here is first we're initializing in 0

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,530
and this

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,950
coin flip is making a mixture of both 0

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,459
and 1 so if I was to do this a thousand

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,890
times

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:27,790
you get about 50/50 that it's in either

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,709
of them so if I was to do this twice how

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,880
many people arise a hands would expect

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:36,720
50/50 obviously no one so everyone's a

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:44,200
quantum expert which is really good

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:47,230
whoops so if you do this a twice what

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,550
happens is it's a hundred percent always

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,950
in the zero State

00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,160
so this operation isn't random so this

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,440
superstition of zero one became all zero

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,180
or gain and this is a negative sign so

00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,980
in quantum you have this ability the

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,510
future operations can cancel the

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,790
previous ones through adding them

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,220
together to give a negative or you can

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,530
think of this as a different way you can

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,239
think of this final part as measuring it

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,160
in a different basis and your ass'll in

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,680
question is the top of the circuit in

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,390
zero plus one or zero minus one and you

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,000
find the answer says it's in zero one

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,680
and then you can do things like

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,420
introduce a phase flip which simply is

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,739
another operator and that flips it in

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,810
the face and now I've made the

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,010
superposition of zero minus one and I

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,650
measure it and I find that it's

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,600
perfectly deterministic so depending on

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,430
how we look at it even though it's in a

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,390
definite say sometimes it's random

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,390
sometimes it's not

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,500
