	00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,279
morning everyone thanks for coming so my

00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,290
name is Chris Faris I'm at IBM

00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,629
distinguished engineer and CTO for open

00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,190
technology at IBM I basically have all

00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,259
the open source and open standards work

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,240
that we do and I'm going to talk about

00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,560
project I've been working on now for the

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
past two and a half years called hyper

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,150
ledger and I'll give you a little bit of

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,260
a story about how it came to be where we

00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,859
are today and where I think we're

00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,320
heading in the future so let's just

00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,330
start by sort of establishing a premise

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,129
I can't really I don't have enough time

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,450
to go into why blockchain is important

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:39,070
what it can do and so forth but that's

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:41,410
just a assert that blockchain is has a

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,460
huge amount of potential for the

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,690
enterprise I mean everybody's familiar

00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,309
with Bitcoin everybody's heard of

00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,610
Bitcoin right everybody's heard of

00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:51,879
aetherium right these are essentially

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,559
platforms for cryptocurrency but the

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,550
underlying technology the blockchain

00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:59,949
itself the consensus models themselves

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,170
those technologies have been around for

00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:05,950
quite a while but is when you bring them

00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,940
all together that Satoshi Nakamoto found

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,920
wow we got this huge huge potential for

00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,610
delivering something we couldn't do

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,040
before

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,380
now Enterprise has sort of been looking

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,630
at blockchain technology and saying well

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,190
we think that there's huge amount of

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,660
potential for this technology to

00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,960
actually transform how we do business

00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:31,840
this is how I am got involved so we

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:34,660
started looking back in about mid 2015

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,630
early 2015 we started exploring the

00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,610
blockchain space understanding what it

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,130
was how the technology works we took a

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,930
very close look at theorem in fact what

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,450
we found was there's a number of issues

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,970
with the technology that we have to

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,630
evolve beyond where it was back then

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,850
even where it is today the first one was

00:01:52,630 --> 00:02:01,060
throughput right I'll give you three

00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:02,500
numbers 720 for 2,400 so 7 was about at

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,370
the time that's about the throughput of

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,030
Bitcoin transactions per second 24 on a

00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:13,330
good day is where aetherium is today

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,099
2400 is visa 2,400 transactions a second

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,019
so when we think about

00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:20,950
we think you know how do we apply this

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:23,469
and adapt this to enterprise solutions

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,109
that are processing hundreds if not

00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:29,170
thousands or even more transactions per

00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:30,730
second so we have huge challenge from a

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,889
throughput perspective latency is

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,260
another one right you think about

00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:38,079
Bitcoin Bitcoin transactions can take an

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,109
hour or even two to settle before you've

00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:42,340
achieved the sort of the halfway point

00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:46,060
where you can say well this isn't going

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,069
to fork again so latency is a problem

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,870
can't exactly use Bitcoin to go and

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,939
purchase something at your local Best

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,290
Buy is they're going to say well okay

00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,180
standing the quarter for two hours while

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,230
we settle your transaction right that's

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,389
that's not going to work governance was

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,489
a problem still is a problem I think in

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:07,209
many of the Bitcoin and blockchain

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:09,219
communities how do we get past the sort

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,540
of the technical challenges and make

00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,459
changes that are actually going to

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,939
impact people's livelihoods or their

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,949
their wealth that's a problem lack of

00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,379
sort of foresight of governance of how

00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,939
we're going to manage the platform's is

00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,349
a problem and then finally I'm just

00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,530
going to talk a little bit about privacy

00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:29,590
there's no privacy in any of those

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,780
networks they may be obscured right

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,370
there may be anonymity but that's not

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,769
really privacy and you can detect

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,319
patterns of behavior and you can start

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:41,109
making inferences based on seeing the

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:46,109
same identities being used over and over

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:48,609
again so the challenge that we have oh

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,949
I'm sorry that's the wrong one that's

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,150
that's somebody else's challenge the

00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,759
challenge that we have in the blockchain

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,769
space the challenge that we have in the

00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:00,370
blockchain space is to achieve consensus

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:03,609
at scale right with high transaction

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,430
throughput low latency of confirmation

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:09,340
of those transactions right to meet the

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,109
enterprise requirements and how do we do

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,930
that in the context of privacy and

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:16,750
confidentiality and we try and solve all

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,729
those problems at the same time you find

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,109
that that's really really hard problem I

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:22,240
mean this is like an NP kind of a

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:24,969
problem right there's always trade-offs

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,770
right so the trade-off that they have in

00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,120
Bitcoin and even in aetherium with proof

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,280
of

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,280
is what we're gonna sacrifice throughput

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,590
and latency for true Byzantine fault

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,699
tolerance right

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,930
there's no trust I can't trust anything

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:43,020
but we have I think in the enterprise

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,990
space we have an opportunity to actually

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,960
incorporate a certain amount of

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,060
governance over a permission network

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,570
that allows us to use more traditional

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,760
forms of consensus for instance so I

00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,160
used to work at Sun Microsystems back in

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,910
the day oh my god I'd realize I've been

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,270
working at IBM now for almost 17 years

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,919
but I work with this guy Bill joy

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,330
Joyce law as a statement he made at one

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,910
point in time that basically says no

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,970
matter who you are more smart people

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,620
work for somebody else right and this is

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,630
true this is true of Google it's true of

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,440
IBM is true of Microsoft it's true of

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,910
every large corporation you can think of

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,070
that when they collaborate and work

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:31,139
together they're much much much more

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:34,289
powerful than any one lone individual or

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,780
even a lone corporation working together

00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:39,930
so as I mentioned IBM was starting to

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,669
explore this space and CTO for open

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,490
technology Jerry Cuomo was the IBM

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,470
fellow who was leading this effort

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,169
between research and some of the

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,060
middleware teams he came to me and he

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:52,260
said look I mean working on this

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,970
blockchain thing we're not really sure

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,800
what we should do with it what's your

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,560
advice what should we do and I said you

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,760
should open-source it I said because

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,849
think about it think about what this

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,990
platform is this is a platform that

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:09,389
needs to be ubiquitous who's gonna buy

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,750
you know we at one point in like the

00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:15,330
1960 I B M had you know sort of the blue

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,880
Enterprise right everybody would say you

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,669
know you can't go wrong buying IBM well

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,110
that those days are gone so it's

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:27,720
unlikely that we're going to win IBM if

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,700
we're just putting out IBM blockchain it

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,860
has to be based on technology that's

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,490
shared by everybody so it has to be open

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,030
source

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,680
and so I've rang up my buddy

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,020
Jim's Emlyn at the Linux Foundation and

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,710
I said hey I've got a proposal for you

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,880
Forrester

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:49,890
a blockchain project and he laughed at

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:53,700
me and I said dude what's I thought it

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,230
was a good idea he says you have no idea

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,170
he said you're about the eighth person

00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,900
to come to me and propose a project at a

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,220
Linux Foundation to work on blockchain

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,920
they said but yours is the first one

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,740
that makes any sense he says you know

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,140
based on IBM's long history Norris and

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,350
and you know the commitment that we have

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:16,020
to building communities around a piece

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,950
of technology he said this is the thing

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,050
that we're gonna do with the only

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,820
expectations so I got together with

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,760
three of our best friends and we

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,060
established in early 2016 we established

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,470
the hyper ledger project it's now more

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,840
than just a project it's really more of

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,680
an initiative when you think about it

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,220
and we have actually we pull together a

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,690
total of ten projects and that's growing

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,000
there's actually a pipeline of

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,530
additional projects that are likely to

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
be come on board and we're calling this

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,100
the hyper ledger greenhouse you think

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,960
about a greenhouse it's someplace where

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,410
you grow things for you cultivate them

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,360
right you nurture them so we have 10

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,890
projects started with hyper ledger

00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,210
fabric which was the contribution from

00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,650
IBM it then grew into two projects with

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,740
the addition of hyper ledger sawtooth

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,080
from Intel and we had hyper ledger

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,840
Iroha a contribution from a Japanese fin

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,870
tech startup NEC in some some

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,880
universities in Japan then we had hyper

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,590
ledger in B which is a self sovereign

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,500
identity based solution that's built on

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,190
blockchain contributed by the sovereign

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,840
foundation and we had hyper ledger

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,600
borough which was our first aetherium

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,910
based project at AI belligerent imes

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,490
people say oh hyper ledger and aetherium

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,400
they're like no that's not true that's

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,140
it's a myth needs to be debunked is

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,020
that's really where the magic happens

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,140
right so what we see now going forward

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,940
is we're seeing these projects not

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,920
competing with one another or not vying

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,440
for who's the best this or that or the

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,310
other thing now we've got these projects

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,150
collaborating with one another building

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:57,360
sort of

00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:00,450
synthetic prop project between them

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,760
right this is organic development within

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,440
the community and I just want to run

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,540
just sort of show you the momentum this

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,029
is the fastest growing project that the

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,910
Linux Foundation ever we now have over

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,320
250 I think I think actually I have a

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,310
board meeting coming up on Monday and I

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,890
think it's 260 we have 10 projects we've

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,870
done two major production based releases

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,110
of of some of those projects with fabric

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,160
and sawtooth the numbers are actually

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,510
better than what I have on the chart

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,110
here I ran the numbers this morning and

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,310
we actually are at 690 something

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,040
contributors to the various projects the

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,180
hyper ledger only about 20 no actually

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
is about eighteen and a half percent of

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,930
those are IBM so a lot of people say oh

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,950
I BM is hyper ledger no we're about

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,170
twenty percent of the contributions

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:47,370
they're coming from all over this

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:49,440
community it's amazing thing so I invite

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,720
you to come and get involved and in the

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
last few seconds I want to sort of

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,860
that's many of you I think have a flyer

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,860

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,870
isn't in a project that IBM is really

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,540
