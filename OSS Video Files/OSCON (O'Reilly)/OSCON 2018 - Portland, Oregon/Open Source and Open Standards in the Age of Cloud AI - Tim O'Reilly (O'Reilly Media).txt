Title: Open Source and Open Standards in the Age of Cloud AI - Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media)
Publication date: 2018-07-18
Playlist: OSCON 2018 - Portland, Oregon
Description: 
	When the term “open source” first took hold 20 years ago, we lived in an age dominated by personal computers. The internet was shaking things up, but it is easy to forget how peripheral it still was. Amazon was only three years old, and Google was born that year. The architectural assumptions of the PC era suffused the definition of open source; the ability to obtain the source code, modify it, run it on your own machine, and redistribute your changes to others was actually how we got new functionality on our machines. Control over proprietary software was the key to monopoly lock-in.

Open source is the value that fuels new industries and pushes forward long-standing ones. Join us in person at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention to cover open source projects across all origins and affiliations. Learn more:  https://oreil.ly/2LQLJ8I
