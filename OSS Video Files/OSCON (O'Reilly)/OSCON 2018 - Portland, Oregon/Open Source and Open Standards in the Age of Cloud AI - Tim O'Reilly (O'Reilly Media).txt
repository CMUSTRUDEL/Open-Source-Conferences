Title: Open Source and Open Standards in the Age of Cloud AI - Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media)
Publication date: 2018-07-18
Playlist: OSCON 2018 - Portland, Oregon
Description: 
	When the term “open source” first took hold 20 years ago, we lived in an age dominated by personal computers. The internet was shaking things up, but it is easy to forget how peripheral it still was. Amazon was only three years old, and Google was born that year. The architectural assumptions of the PC era suffused the definition of open source; the ability to obtain the source code, modify it, run it on your own machine, and redistribute your changes to others was actually how we got new functionality on our machines. Control over proprietary software was the key to monopoly lock-in.

Open source is the value that fuels new industries and pushes forward long-standing ones. Join us in person at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention to cover open source projects across all origins and affiliations. Learn more:  https://oreil.ly/2LQLJ8I

	00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,620
and that's one of the other things I

00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,139
love about open source in this community

00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,230
and that's his curiosity that is

00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:13,839
continually learning by doing by pushing

00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,960
the envelope trying to understand how to

00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,820
build systems that work better and the

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,910
reason I use this slide of a classroom

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,419
is because this also just a little

00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:29,109
sidelight here the gift of universal

00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:32,380
education was one of the great advances

00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:35,140
of the 19th and 20th century but we are

00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,730
now moving beyond it and we're moving

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,060
beyond it in a way that is demonstrated

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,460
by this community because we can no

00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,430
longer treat education simply as

00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,190
something we do once as a stage of life

00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,890
that we get over with and what the open

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,720
source community reminds us of is that

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,910
we have to keep learning through life we

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,370
have to keep reinventing ourselves we

00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,400
have to keep rediscovering that way of

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,290
life and aligning ourselves with it

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,230
because we're now entering into a new

00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,960
world and AI is one of these areas where

00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,810
there's this tremendous opportunity and

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,760
need for learning and it's so important

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,820
that some of the key open source stack

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,370
the key AI technologies are open source

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,140
and that groups like open AI are trying

00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,390
to put this stuff into the public domain

00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:26,290
but we have to go further than that

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,790
we have to understand our algorithms and

00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,740
what we're building this is not in

00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,940
O'Reilly conference I wish it was but I

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,130
think it's great that it's associated

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,290
with ACM and this really a science

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,940
conference conference on fairness

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,360
accountability and transparency in

00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,400
algorithms and we definitely have to go

00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,860
deeper there but we also need to

00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,070
understand that our markets are

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,530
increasingly ruled by algorithms and by

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,200
AI and and part of understanding what

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,909
I'm calling the way of life is summed up

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,490
beautifully in the title of a book on

00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:00,909
market design by Alvin Roth called who

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:03,940
gets what and why he got his Nobel Prize

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,560
for the design of better marketplaces

00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,720
for kidney exchange you know kidney

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,579
transplants but his point was that

00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,019
markets are the outcome of design

00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:14,200
decisions and you can design better

00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,590
markets and so we now have these vast

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,080
more

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,480
get places in the cloud where the

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,180
algorithms decide who gets what and why

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,120
and we understand that a better design

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,209
marketplace can have better outcomes so

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,890
we can see the failure modes already so

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,599
here's a recent tweet a driver in

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,160
Houston just texted me he drove for

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,410
three hours last night and didn't make a

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,720
single dollar actually he lost five

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,310
dollars and fifty cents right this

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,680
ride-sharing stuff is ridiculous for

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,830
many drivers so here's a burr whose

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,380
fundamental job is to actually make a

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,709
matching marketplace of drivers and

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,690
passengers and they have to get it right

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:56,530
if they don't solve this problem they

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,390
will fail if they cannot actually figure

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,459
out how to use their algorithms to

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,000
manage this marketplace in such a way

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:07,120
that both sides win they're screwed and

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,370
we see this throughout the history of of

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,230
other companies generosity is the robust

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,650
strategy you look at what happened with

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:18,250
the iPhone here was this new proprietary

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,660
platform Microsoft Nokia other companies

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,450
went up against it with their own

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,000
proprietary platforms Google established

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,739
an alternative with generosity by making

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,370
open-source available for others to

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,750
build on unfortunately over time they

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,549
figured out how to make that a new

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,579
source of lock-in they're just a subject

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,859
of a recent lawsuit from the AC European

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,260
community this is a real problem they

00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:43,480
have actually forgotten the way of life

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,430
and they've also forgotten that in their

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,040
core search just do a search in Google

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,019
and you'll see for example this is a

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,930
search for restaurants near my home in

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,519
Oakland Google itself is delivering the

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,760
results you can see down at the bottom

00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,310
the old site of the web you know Yelp

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,470
but well below the fold on a normal

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,480
screen google forgot that its strength

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,239
was in the rich ecosystem of the open

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,620
web and began to compete with it and

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,930
conveniently that also increases google

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,299
profits Amazon is also competing with

00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:17,220
its supplier ecosystem this is a failure

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,220
to understand the way of life

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,320
