hi this is Roger Mikolas I'm here at

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,970
Ascot 2018 in Portland Oregon and I'm

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,130
here with Chris Ferris who is the CTO

00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,900
open technology to IBM and an IBM

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,540
distinguished engineer welcome Chris

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,180
thank you how are you enjoying Ascot so

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:25,050
so far it's great yeah I'm enjoying it

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:27,449
quite a bit any no surprises I enjoyed

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,970
giving my keynote this morning and that

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,340
they didn't leave so you know it's

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,340
obvious that when I give my keynote

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,010
tomorrow good so one of these I've

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,079
noticed with open source when we started

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,590
this conference 20 years ago which is

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,870
that kind of amazing open source is a

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,329
bit controversial yeah as you know yeah

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,000
and now it has become just really the

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,590
de-facto way that's right things are

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,270
things are done and I think there's

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,530
something shaping yeah

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,930
so it's wondering if you could you know

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,629
just kind of comment on how critical

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,579
open source is to IBM's technical

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,320
strategy and then kind of IBM's role in

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,260
there and maybe even addressing some of

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,390
these things about how open source that

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,890
kind of fits and yet the ecosystem of

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,340
taking yeah so open source is it's it's

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:22,680
a fundamental way of how we do

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:23,970
development for well certainly it was

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,650
one of the reasons that I was hired was

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,460
to help IBM sort of work through that

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:33,840
that whole transformation I cannot think

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,869
of a single software offering that we

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,729
have that's organically developed inside

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,570
IBM that is not based on open source

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,340
right now just about everything we do is

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,930
is being developed now it doesn't mean

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,290
that there isn't technology that IBM has

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,310
that isn't open source but pretty much

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,200
the the transition has completely

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,700
overtaken us when we entered into the

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,439
cloud area you know we started working

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,520
with OpenStack and cloud foundry and

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,520
docker and kubernetes

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,290
and we're continuing down that path so

00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,869
our our technology is now firmly based

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,790
on a solid foundation of open source not

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,150
just small dependencies but also large

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,770
frameworks and so forth and from our

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,060
perspective when we think about entering

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,160
into a new area of Technology regardless

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,470
of what it is one of the things that we

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,170
look at is what is the technology

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,580
landscape and open source which one of

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:35,040
those projects is is right for IBM those

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,210
does it have open governance is it you

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,000
know it doesn't have a diverse community

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,360
is it growing an ecosystem around that

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
technology base that's not just a single

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,670
vendor right and if it is then we work

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,060
to try and move it in the direction of

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,680
more open and so so it's it's it's it's

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,150
fundamentally important for us and it's

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,720
and it's from the top down I mean Ginni

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,940
Rometty is is fully behind our open

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,280
sourcing just about anything that you

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,900
can conceive of mmm-hmm that's great so

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,800
what are some of the key open source

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,030
initiatives you guys are working on

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,380
we're actually let me count the ways

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:16,739
yeah so my team is actually my team has

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,730
sort of responsibility for being the non

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,590
product facing engineers that work in

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,590
various open source communities and

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,709
we're actually tracking about 17 that

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,480
are strategic to IBM or IBM offerings in

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:35,880
arranging from cloud containers

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,910
blockchain AI and machine learning deep

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,910
learning

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:48,060
cryptography kafka you know the data

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:52,510
analytics you know the Hadoop stack

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:56,230
spark I mean I don't know if I could

00:03:52,510 --> 00:04:00,640
write you know exactly no we so we

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:03,790
invest in those in those initiatives we

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,470
try and earn our proverbial stripes in

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,569
those communities right to earn

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,880
technical eminence to be able to be in a

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,530
position where it's not like IBM is

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,220
saying hi were from IBM we're here to

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,239
help it's more like literally we're from

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,540
IBM what can we do to help you you know

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,510
and and and so so I have that team and

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,610
then we have engineers from just about

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,470
every division you can think of at IBM

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,479
including the services divisions that

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,560
are engaged in those same open source

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:37,030
projects and more right I mean we have

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,820
the strategic ones but then there's all

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,669
the dependencies that they have and iBM

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,800
is either involved in porting those to

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,050
our various platforms or you know

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,450
working on up streaming bug fixes and so

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,180
forth into those communities hey you

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:55,050
mentioned blockchain sure and how does

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,580
blockchain fit in Bakhtin has so much

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,470
baggage sounds negative but it's gotta

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,729
be a better word there's just so much

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,120
around blockchain

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:06,610
yes yeah so that's actually the the

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,440
focus that I have right now is on the

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,180
work that we're doing in blockchain at

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,539
hyper ledger and the Linux Foundation I

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:19,240
actually started the the the initiative

00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:22,330
there and you know again sort of a

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,889
similar story where IBM has been doing

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,349
some work in research to understand

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,120
blockchain to figure out if this is

00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:29,770
something that we can apply into an

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,030
enterprise context and what would we do

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,050
with it and the bait they basically came

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,220
to me and said what should we do with

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,430
this and I said you should open-source

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,500
it right because it needs to be more

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,690
than just an IBM thing it needs to be a

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,440
community asset it needs to be something

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,440
where we're getting

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,690
engineering talent cryptographic

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,880
consensus distributed computing

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,210
containers just about every discipline

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,419
you can think of applies in this context

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,639
and you know we we felt very strongly

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,340
that this needed to be to be to be open

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,320
source and and and it's and it's one of

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,510
those three areas that Jenny Jenny likes

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,880
to track things and trees that's that's

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,160
her that that's just the way that she

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,720
likes to think about things and so when

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,669
she thinks about the sort of the key

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,580
strategic initiatives that IBM is

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:24,250
investing in it would be cloud it'd be

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,250
AI and and machine learning and Abby

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,880
blockchain right and so this is an area

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,950
that you know again iBM is I think in

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,240
many respects I think is considered a

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,810
leader in enterprise ball chain

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,180
technology but we're also trying to do

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,800
that from the perspective of this needs

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,560
to be more than us right and so now you

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,840
see iBM has an IBM blocked in is based

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:53,639
on hyper ledger fabric we have Microsoft

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:57,639
Google Amazon Oracle ping on in China

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,320
Alibaba all our building technology Iowa

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,090
wood gave a keynote this morning all

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,710
building technology around the hyper

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,450
ledger platforms and so this is this is

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,490
exactly the kind of thing that IBM looks

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,750
to do is to sort of build we need to

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,000
build a community and an ecosystem

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,380
around it so I'm just curious one of the

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,120
great things about blockchain in that

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,889
mode is that it's a perfect open source

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,840
kind of project is the real value of the

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,950
rock chain is how you apply it that's

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,389
right right and so then you can make

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,460
your that's where you make your money's

00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,560
in the solutions exist right having a

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,150
good it's not the base it almost never

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,370
is the same thing with cloud with

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,710
containers that's sort of table stakes

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,510
everybody's got to have it TCP right

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,580
everybody's got to have it and you don't

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,310
differentiate on my TCP stack is better

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,110
than yours that those days are well

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,419
behind us now it's really much more what

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,950
do you build with it yeah yeah so where

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,960
do you see it going in the next year

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,960
year and a half so you know we started

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,870
with as I noted in Mike you know we have

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,240
10 projects 10 independent projects that

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,770
are have been incubated some of sort of

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,760
graduated through incubation

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:06,290
at in hyper ledger and we're starting to

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:09,620
see us break past the sort of the

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,610
parochial kind of approach that people

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,440
take to these projects to much more of a

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,260
collaborative synergistic kind of an

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,230
approach where we're all trying to solve

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,610
similar problems and instead of just

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,920
sort of putting the finishing touches on

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,450
software that we had been developing now

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,790
we're looking to sort of break new

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,980
ground and that's where we're starting

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:34,310
to see these you know these these

00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,600
synergies come so for instance the

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,490
number of the projects have been looking

00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,200
to see how do we integrate an aetherium

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,000
virtual machine into the various

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,470
platforms that are all have sort of

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,050
different approaches how they do

00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:49,370
consensus how they do permissioning for

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,170
a private for permission blockchain but

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,540
then we can have we can share the same

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,970
smart contract engine right you know and

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,220
then consensus is another example where

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,290
a couple of the projects are looking at

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,380
how do i integrate raft based consensus

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,490
into our platforms let's build one

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,830
interface that we can then plug in

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,750
different solutions so so we're starting

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,730
to see these these sort of integrations

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,250
we're starting to then also see some new

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,250
innovation like work around zero

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,890
knowledge proof also sort of become sort

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,560
of a community project rather than

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,650
something that's championed by one of

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,110
the initial sponsors of the the first

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,480
five or ten project so so I what we're

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,040
starting to see is that that concern

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,300
want to call it consolidation is it

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,570
really in about consolidation really

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,310
componentization honing the api's that

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,350
we have around these software components

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,190
so that we can in fact sort of be much

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,010
more plug-and-play

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,810
with each other and that we can then

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,700
take those components and we can then

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,650
with that build various solution it

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,590
sounds like the open source way yeah

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,940
yeah working out really well it sounds

00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,260
fascinating a real look forward to

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,540
getting more about what's going on with

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,370
hyper ledger and your blockchain work in

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,540
particular so thanks for spending the

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,540
