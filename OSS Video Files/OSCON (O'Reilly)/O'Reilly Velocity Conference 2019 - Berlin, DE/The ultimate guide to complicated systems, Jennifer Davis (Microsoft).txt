Description: 
	Building and maintaining distributed systems is hard. Industry tools and recommended practices are evolving at an ever-increasing velocity.

you will run into scenarios that are

00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:13,129
very simple and you will make mistakes I

00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:16,460
have over 20 years of experience I know

00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:19,880
you build redundancy n when the

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:25,730
happened I realized my mistake in not

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:29,780
having duplicate clothing available it's

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:32,090
a problem so one of the key aspects of

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,829
it is making sure that you have a

00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,899
culture where people are not blaming

00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:39,109
each other if you do make mistakes

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,559
now we think about snowflakes in terms

00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:43,850
of configuration management

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,469
configuration management should prevent

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,170
us from having special snowflake

00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,449
snowflakes are bad and I'm not talking

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,199
about those snowflakes no matter what

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:57,079
software we're building and deploying if

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,329
even if it's the same exact software and

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,940
platforms from another company the

00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:04,460
people maintaining building deploying

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,880
using your software are different those

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:11,329
people impact the system and the project

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,930
so you have different systems so yay

00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:18,320
snowflakes are cool embrace your

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,899
snowflake share information about your

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,030
snowflake I want to see those pictures

00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:26,649
and diagrams and experiences that you're

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,649
having that's awesome

00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:35,810
by having this experience of sharing you

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:39,289
can see over time that change happens

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:42,469
what you deploy day one is no way shape

00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:46,939
or form the same is day 10 day 90 day

00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:52,039
365 it changes and yet we think it's the

00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,020
same exact thing what we deploy what we

00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:57,020
experience what we're maintaining what

00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,119
we're operating it is not the same

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,039
system that we started out with it's

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,579
definitely not the same plan that we

00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,579
