Description: 
	What makes an open source project popular? What makes it successful? What gives it longevity and vibrancy? What convinces people to invest their careers in it?
Ten years ago Dave encountered Go and was smitten. So he set out, like all keen advocates, to tell the world about why Go was important to him, and thus—clearly—why it should be important to them. But it turns out that selling a language has almost nothing to do with syntax, or features, or concurrency, or simplicity.
This talk is about the unexpected things Dave learned along the way trying to convince programmers to try Go and how they might translate to the experiences that all have working in an ecosystem of open source projects.
