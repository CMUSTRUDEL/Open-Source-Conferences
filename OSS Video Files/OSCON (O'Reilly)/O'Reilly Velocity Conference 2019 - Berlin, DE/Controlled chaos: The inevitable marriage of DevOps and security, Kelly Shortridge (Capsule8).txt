Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - Berlin, DE
Description: 
	Software is eating the world, and security will be eaten as well if it doesn’t evolve. Kelly Shortridge exposes why chaos and resilience engineering represents the future of security programs—and why it catalyzes the dawn of defensive innovation. You’ll examine how adopting distributed, immutable, and ephemeral infrastructure (the “DIE” triad) can create powerful security benefits.
Finally, focusing on practical implementation, you’ll delve into the art of harnessing chaos for security and how to conduct security tests within the DIE model. Through this marriage of security and DevOps, security can transform from a frustrating cost center to a lean, mean, innovation machine that supports software delivery performance.
