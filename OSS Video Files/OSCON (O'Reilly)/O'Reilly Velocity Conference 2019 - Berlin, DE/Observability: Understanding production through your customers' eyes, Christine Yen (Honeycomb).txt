Publication date: 2019-11-06
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - Berlin, DE
Description: 
	Observability isn’t just for ops folks, but it’s not only about engineering roles, either. It’s the lens that allows various functions all across the software lifecycle to perceive the same reality. By empowering you to ask new questions of your software, observability fuels curiosity about the world as it is, not how you expect it to be. In the end, after all, Christine Yen explains, “Nines don’t matter if your users aren’t happy.”
