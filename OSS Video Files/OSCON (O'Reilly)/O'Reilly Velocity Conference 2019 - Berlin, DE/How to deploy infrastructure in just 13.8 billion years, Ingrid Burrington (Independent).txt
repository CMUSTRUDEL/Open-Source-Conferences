The reliability of cloud services tends to operate in the perpetual present tenseâ€”focused more on maintaining systems right now than preparing for a far future. Ingrid Burrington explores how the reframing of the time scales of computation can change and maybe improve the way your build infrastructure.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
one of the things I find really

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,870
interesting making work around and and

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,200
studying network infrastructure is it's

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,790
very weird relationship to time and to

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,440
the kind of the scales of time right

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,619
like billions of years of planetary

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,109
transformation had to happen for me to

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,539
be able to have a phone in my pocket

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,189
that lets me know that I have an email

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,470
and that seems like a really

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,990
anticlimactic end to that long of a

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,460
process personally and the amount of

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,530
stuff also that just sort of the heaven

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,910
and earth that had to be moved the the

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,739
things that had to be put into low-earth

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,379
orbit the things that had to be put

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,600
through the ocean for me to know that

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,239
and have an email seems like kind of

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,700
astonishingly overwhelmingly large right

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,320
I've sometimes found it useful to

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,539
describe the Internet as sort of the

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,690
most ambitious terraforming project ever

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,870
undertaken by civilization only instead

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,510
of making a not earth-like planet more

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,390
inhabitable for humans we have made the

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,780
earth more inhabitable for computers or

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,240
I guess like corporate personhood but

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,430
terraforming isn't so much a dream of

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,680
science fiction so much as it is a

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,110
warning from it right even in the most

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,810
kind of idealistic vision of what

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,390
terraforming can be it is humans

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,610
deciding which types of life and which

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,439
types of landscapes matter and which

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,880
ones don't what is kind of the

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
appropriate version of what life should

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,079
be and imposing that view on on a

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,790
landscape right I mean it's just it's

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,400
just a big allegory for colonialism

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,229
basically and it also kind of tends to

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,439
assume a sort of sense of like

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,700
entitlement and void in those spaces but

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,829
you know when you're when you're kind of

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,290
turning the the planet into basically a

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,299
very large computer what you're really

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,340
doing is kind of grafting systems onto

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,680
systems onto systems you're doing this

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,460
sort of alkalizing of mineral deposits

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,460
