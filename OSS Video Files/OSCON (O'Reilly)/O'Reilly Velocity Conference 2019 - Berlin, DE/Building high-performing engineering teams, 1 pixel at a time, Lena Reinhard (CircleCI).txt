Title: Building high-performing engineering teams, 1 pixel at a time, Lena Reinhard (CircleCI)
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - Berlin, DE
Description: 
	Psychological safety is one of the leading indicators of a high-performing team. Yet forging deep human relationships and building trust can be difficult when your team is distributed or largely interacts on screens.
With remote-working becoming a norm in our industry, join Lena Reinhard to explore how you can make distributed teams stronger, more deliberate, and produce better results. It’s simple—connection, communication, and collaboration.
Integrating these approaches into your day-to-day will help engineering leaders become more strategic, communicate better, and build highly aligned, well-connected and strong teams that deliver great products.

the basis of all connection is trust

00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,390
trusting our teammates means that we're

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,730
able to rely on each other we care about

00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,200
each other the trust also means that

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,630
we're able to own the mistakes that we

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,180
make we earn trust not through grand

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,360
gestures but through small pixel size

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,090
actions and moments teams are built on

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,770
mutual trust as a foundation and so many

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,750
actions of the two of that I'll talk

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,490
over in the course of this talk are

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,420
specifically designed to help us build

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,160
trust in our teams but Trust starts when

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,110
we look beyond the pixels that we see on

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,510
our screens and make space for our

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,760
humanness

00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,930
when I joined Circle CI last year I met

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
with everyone in our engineering

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,040
organization to get to know the people

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,320
in our teams during one of those

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,469
conversations one of our engineers said

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,629
to me I need to meet my team in person

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,980
every once in a while to remind myself

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,800
that there are actual people the

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,170
sentiment struck a chord with me and

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,969
I've been thinking about it since when

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,090
we largely interact with two-dimensional

00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,549
piles of pixels on screens or with icons

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,799
and chats it's just so easy to forget

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,799
that who we interact with are actual

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,349
humans when we Center each other's

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,209
humaneness we go beyond knowing the

00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,649
areas of expertise that our teammates

00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:26,039
have or what they're getting done in

00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:28,200
their day we get curious about who they

00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:32,009
are as people what drives and motivates

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,479
them and what frustrates them recently

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,880
when a new team was formed in our

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,139
company they created a document in which

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,399
everyone on the team introduced

00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,380
themselves to the others

00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,899
they talked about things like how they

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,849
got into tech their careers so far their

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,329
pets their hobbies and what they care

00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:50,279
about in their lives I also have a

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,169
theory that special interest channels in

00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:54,450
company jets with many of you made which

00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:56,729
many of you may know are so popular for

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,979
the exact same reason they allow us to

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,919
see each other as humans and they help

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,450
us connect at an interpersonal level but

00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:05,159
honestly it's also just really cool to

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,659
know that one of my teammates made

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,329
another successful sourdough bread on

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,909
the weekend another build build a Lego

00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,720
Ford with their kids and one other built

00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,820
a net build a new keyboard

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,320
I also think it really helps to be

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,390
mindful of special events in our

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,310
teammates lives like knowing which

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,200
holidays anniversaries or birthdays they

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,310
care about and reaching out to them on

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,650
those days but part of being human is

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,780
also that all of us have very different

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,090
values and expectations around how we

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,430
prefer to collaborate communicate and

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,410
what matters to us many of those are

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,630
shaped by the work cultures that we grew

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,410
up in the societies or backgrounds in

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:46,660
our or work context so far these are

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,430
often implicit and we connect can

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,080
connect as the team by surfacing them

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,060
and talking about what we expect from

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,060
