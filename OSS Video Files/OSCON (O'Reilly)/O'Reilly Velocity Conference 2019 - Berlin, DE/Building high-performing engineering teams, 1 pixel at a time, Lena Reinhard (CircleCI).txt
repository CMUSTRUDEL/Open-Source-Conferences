Description: 
	Psychological safety is one of the leading indicators of a high-performing team. Yet forging deep human relationships and building trust can be difficult when your team is distributed or largely interacts on screens.
With remote-working becoming a norm in our industry, join Lena Reinhard to explore how you can make distributed teams stronger, more deliberate, and produce better results. It’s simple—connection, communication, and collaboration.
Integrating these approaches into your day-to-day will help engineering leaders become more strategic, communicate better, and build highly aligned, well-connected and strong teams that deliver great products.
