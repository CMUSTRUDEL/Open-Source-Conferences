We never change the amount of work or technical debt; we just shift it, and with it, we change how it emerges and appears. Our systems don’t have to be perfect to be operational—planes and networks function at extremely high levels even though they are not operating at 100%.
As an industry, we’ve moved the locus of control from hardware to operating system to virtual machine to container to orchestration, and now we’re approaching serverless. None of that has reduced the amount of work that must happen, it just makes it possible to reuse and conceptually compress the work of others. Since we’re making the work in our tools less visible, we also have less control over how they work. We end up assuming that the promises that have been true will continue to be true, but that’s not in our control.
Heidi Waterhouse explores how you handle this level of uncertainty by adding in error budgets, layered access, and other accommodations for failure and for designing your systems for function over form or purity.

	00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,189
heartbleed was a really excellent

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,069
example of this most of us do not think

00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:11,220
about our chipsets it's not our problem

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,820
we have a lot of layers between us and

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,610
like rocks we taught to think but it

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,190
turns out rocks we taught to think is

00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,369
pretty fundamental to how our world

00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,710
works and if those rocks start thinking

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,449
bad thoughts we're gonna have to make

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,199
changes in how we work and how we

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,290
understand how fast things can go oh my

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,829
gosh this was amazing and it's all

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:42,329
because of a choice technical debt

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:45,090
incurred a long time ago so we're all

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,010
dependent and I'm just gonna keep saying

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,800
this we are all dependent and we are all

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,399
interdependent we are all relying on

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,989
each other

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,870
we are not stoic isolationists no matter

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,940
how much it feels like it no matter how

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,610
much we feel like self-made people

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,940
that's not what's happening we are

00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:10,530
standing in a circle in a community with

00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:13,680
others dark debt this is a great term

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,180
dark debt is inevitable just like

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,310
technical debt and it's invisible

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,210
because it's not something that we

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,090
deliberately incur it's what occurs it's

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,610
the emergent property of complex systems

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,180
when you put a lot of thinking rocks

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,990
together sometimes they have things

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,820
thinks thoughts that we don't anticipate

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,549
sometimes a system has a little wobble

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,470
that is accelerated by another system's

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,110
wobble and then all of a sudden there's

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,720
like an oscillation and everything falls

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,700
down it was not predictable from either

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,220
system that this would happen it is only

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,100
in combination that we are getting this

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,900
dark debt this problem that we could not

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,979
anticipate until we put something in

00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,009
production under load and then and then

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:06,420
we find out exactly how our systems are

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,700
linked together control is an illusion

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,229
it's an illusion we need because

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,620
otherwise we would feel utterly

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,970
paralyzed but it's an illusion we

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,680
think we're controlling what we do

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,629
because we're the ones doing it

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,430
that's like believing that we are

00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,379
controlling cars when we're driving them

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,530
do you believe that when you're driving

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,750
do you feel like you're in control yeah

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,599
so there's like the other people on the

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,640
road and we can affect how the car works

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,950
we can steer we can drive you know

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,650
accelerate and stop but we're not in

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,810
control of the car as an ecosystem we

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,180
just have enough conceptual compression

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,860
to believe that we are but if a supplier

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,470
on the other side of the world has

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,019
faulty actuators and those get put into

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,079
airbags and the airbags get put into

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,989
cars by third-party contractors there's

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,760
not one thing that we can do to affect

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,239
whether or not that's going to

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,190
accidentally go off at a crucial moment

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,400
we choose suppliers that are as good as

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,290
we can manage but it's not like we can

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,019
visit the factories of every subsystem

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,659
ourselves we are relying on the car

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,970
manufacturer to have done quality

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,239
control they are relying on their

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,389
providers to have done quality control

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,340
but nothing is perfect

00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:25,290
we can't control anything in our

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,900
complicated lives completely and the

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,430
sooner we internalize that and start

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,049
talking about reliability instead of

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,049
