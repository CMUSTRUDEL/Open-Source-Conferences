Publication date: 2019-11-06
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - Berlin, DE
Description: 
	Can a system ever truly be considered reliable if it isnâ€™t fundamentally secure? In a world where most products are connected to the internet, especially as cloud technologies and machine learning become more prevalent, enabling security by default is increasingly important. Ana Oprea provides insights, advice, and strategies for baking security into your systems.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,720
in September 2012 there was a Google

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,740
wide announcement for our Bay Area

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,990
colleagues that the Wi-Fi password on

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,260
the fleet of buses that connects

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:21,000
Google's campuses in around San

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,369
Francisco will change so since everybody

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,150
wanted to be online Internet is

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,390
connected everybody want to check what

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,030
the new password is and Google has a

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,130
system for storing passwords a

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,700
centralized password management service

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,450
this was created five years prior to the

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,510
date I mentioned and it was meant to be

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,270
used by a small amount of system

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,820
administrator administrators to share

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,270
secrets for third-party services that

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,980
didn't support better authentication and

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,780
authorization as you might imagine a few

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,880
thousand employees are more than a

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,130
handful so the system went down Google

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,159
cares about reliability so we have a

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,820
secondary replica of our password

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,369
management service where our load

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,890
chaining strategies have diverted all

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,200
the traffic however this was just

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,000
replicated traffic so the secondary

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,799
replicas failed in the same way the

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,560
first one it at that point an on-call

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,049
engineer was paged this uncle engineer

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,939
was based on the east coast of the US

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:41,130
and it was a big surprise for them that

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,640
this incident is happening since our

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,220
password manager service did not have

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,270
any outage in its prior five years of

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,280
existence however we're prepared we had

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,649
a list of steps to take in order to

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,509
restart the service and the uncle

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:02,909
engineer followed them nothing worked

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,509
it seemed that in order to restart the

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,530
service a particular card needed to be

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,510
inserted in a hardware security module

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,709
none of these cards were located on the

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,290
east coast of the US

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,989
where the uncle engineer was based so

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,689
they follow the procedures they looked

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:26,159
up the contact and they reached out to a

00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,859
colleague in Australia the colleague in

00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:35,010
Australia kept calm went to the safe

00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:37,019
where the card was located and then

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,609
looked up the code to the safe where do

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,000
you think the code of the safe was

00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:44,519
stored I guess you might have already

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,040
guessed in the password management

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,810
system that was now offline that we were

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,019
trying to bring back up so what to do

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,569
then there was a second copy a another

00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,359
card in a safe on the west coast of the

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,189
US and thankfully there was an engineer

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,840
who had memorized the code of the safe

00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:12,870
so they were able to retrieve the card

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:15,299
card in place inserted in the HSM many

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,180
green lights blinking but the system

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,669
would still not come up it took the

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,019
engineers around an additional hour of

00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:27,209
debugging to figure out that the green

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,019
lights did not mean that the card was

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:33,090
properly inserted in the HSM but that it

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,689
had to be flipped around once that

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,879
happened

00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:38,909
the service was successfully restored

00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,519
and everybody could access the Wi-Fi

00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:44,669
password after a few minor changes to

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,060
the service and go online and happy

00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,060
