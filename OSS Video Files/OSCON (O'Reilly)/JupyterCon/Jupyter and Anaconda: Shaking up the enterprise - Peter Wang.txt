	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,390
it's really incredible to be here and it

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,189
is such an honor to to be given the

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,980
stage to speak to all of you here at the

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,269
first Jupiter con I look around to see a

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,740
lot of familiar faces around a lot of

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,230
people in the halls and it just

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,260
reinforces how many people have worked

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,850
so hard to make all this possible and

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,760
they've worked on it for you know many

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,680
people worked on for over a decade and I

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,140
have a lot of thoughts around the

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,029
technology dynamics that kind of bring

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,859
us to this moment and that will lead us

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,000
into the future and about all the

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,399
different possible futures that might

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,190
lay ahead but I don't have a lot of time

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,440
up here so I'm gonna focus basically on

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,930
talking about one sort of common thing

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,510
that I see between Jupiter and anaconda

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,129
and and what's made them successful and

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,100
also some of the challenges they face I

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,329
think that they'll face moving forward

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,370
so this conference I think is quite

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,829
clear it's sort of an inflection point

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,449
right it's it's it or maybe it shows

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,039
that were undergoing in a flexion where

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,660
the technology that we've built is a

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,570
small community relatively small

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,860
community of contributors and innovators

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:10,140
that's really starting to go mainstream

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,360
and our community has had the good

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,729
fortune of being descended from the

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,200
Python the Syfy communities and that's

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,720
led to I think it's generally very

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,750
welcoming and friendly to newcomers sort

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,950
of atmosphere right - Bret's quote about

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,600
staying for the community the Python

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,159
community is absolutely wonderful but

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,509
it's important to keep in mind that many

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,270
of the newcomers most of the newcomers

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,299
to our community have been interested in

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,729
the code in the technology and when

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,979
technologies cross from kind of that

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,700
innovator early adopter into the

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,380
mainstream of adoption that user

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,170
community that you get the users are

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,850
somewhat different and and the

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,070
difference I think for like the early

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,500
majority late majority type of users is

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,899
that the tools they're adopting they're

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,509
doing it to get their jobs done right

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,219
they're doing it to learn more move up

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,869
the career ladder it's gonna enable them

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,159
to do their jobs better but they go home

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,509
at 5:00 p.m. they go home on the

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,430
weekends and they're gonna watch TV

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,409
spend time with the kids they're

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,090
probably not maybe many of them will but

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,440
they're mostly not going to be sitting

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,750
there on github at 9:00 p.m. on a

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,710
Saturday night and and I don't mean that

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,690
as a criticism

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,060
right that's not a criticism that's just

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,250
we shouldn't expect our users to write

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,450
and so as a developer and innovator

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,720
community I think we need to recognize

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,360
that meeting the needs of that kind of

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,860
community that user community is going

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,290
to take on a different of flavor and and

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,380
in growing anaconda watching it go from

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,450
you know a thousand downloads you know

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,770
over the course of a month to now we

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,050
have millions and millions of downloads

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,880
a month I've definitely seen that

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,440
transition happening in that user base

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,970
and I think that the Jupiter community

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,740
is you know you see that the picture of

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,360
the Berklee class it's undergoing that

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,590
same kind of transformation and it does

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,570
mean something different for all of us

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:57,000
as the community the early innovator

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,650
community that created it and oh I hit

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,080
the wrong button sorry

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,330
and that changing demographic right it's

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,250
got real consequences for the technical

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,930
community going from you know playing

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,210
gigs in a small band to playing stadiums

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,760
you have a very different kind of

00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,680
atmosphere that you inhabit and this

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,410
related is actually the commercial

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,510
adoption of Python in general and the

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,540
the PI data sci-fi tools and certainly

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,950
the commercial Dopson of Jupiter and my

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,500
company continuum analytics we've been

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,640
at the crossroads of this since the very

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,960
beginning since the founding of the

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,490
company really and so I've got a lot of

00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,980
opinions more than will fit in a 10

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,540
minute time slot so I encourage you guys

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,980
to come to my talk at noon today where I

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,900
will go into much greater detail about

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,040
this and have time for Q&A and really

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,420
have a discussion around because I think

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,250
it's one that as a community we need to

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,990
have but in this talk I'm going to focus

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,070
on one fundamentally important issue and

00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,660
Fernando and I did not coordinate our

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,070
keynotes actually and you could tell

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,040
because my issues the same as his core

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,420
issue which is the one of sustainability

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,530
and maybe it says something at a meta

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,180
level that the two of us didn't

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,170
coordinate but we're both focused and

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,420
both interested in this topic

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,060
sustainability now in an open-source

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,810
context for a developer community of

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,790
open source

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,440
you know devs when you say

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,910
sustainability people now start nodding

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,100
their heads they understand oh yeah

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,960
that's an issue right because anyone

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,910
who's made a popular open-source library

00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,040
they know that at some point just

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,780
putting up with you know the issues in

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,580
the triage and then responding mailing

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,260
list it burns devs out it creates

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,600
tensions and the team does all these

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,360
things and more critically as software

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,360
gets more more popular it passes the

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,389
critical threshold where more of the

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,400
important activity on net-net the most

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,900
important activity is not the code

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,419
itself but it's things like

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,210
documentation on workshops and tutorials

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:45,150
it's growing and adding new devs to the

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,610
team and so the communication and the

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,500
knowledge artifacts become the more

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,530
important thing more so than the feature

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,939
artifacts actually so now there's a lot

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,139
of discussion around this right in

00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,550
recent years we've had heartbleed

00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,620
embarrassing the entire technical world

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,759
we've had the new PG project also

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,319
needing you know being sore knee to

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,020
funds people were surprised when numpy

00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,039
got its first funding I think last year

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,960
or maybe it was earlier this year and

00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,479
now in the Python PI data world with num

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,069
focus we've really been able to step up

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,210
and address this over the last few years

00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,909
it's still growing but it's something

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,860
that we've really been able to to take

00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:24,719
you know take some serious action about

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,639
and also I think in the Python PI data

00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:28,860
sci-fi world we're very fortunate

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,840
because the core of our work it is

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,569
actually in the critical path to

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,210
business value to analytical value for a

00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,889
lot of organizations and so you do get

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,479
funding from NSF DARPA all the

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,099
foundations that Fernanda mentioned we

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,349
get private funding from a lot of

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,719
commercial partners like to Sigma

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,610
Bloomberg and so there's there's a lot

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:49,409
of interest and money flowing into our

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,699
ecosystem which is really great we still

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,240
have to organize it which is why I'm

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,349
focus is so important in this regard and

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,849
additionally because of our heritage

00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,949
coming from the scientific Python

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,569
community and so many scientists having

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,490
put their time into all this it's

00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,439
important that they get recognition kind

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,479
of in the academic ladder of merit right

00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,400
and that's the effort behind open access

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,490
journals and the citation of source code

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,289
all these things are ways to help people

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,089
who do this out of the love in their

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,240
hearts actually be able to sustain that

00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:20,279
effort but there is another aspect of

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,589
sustainability that goes beyond what we

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,060
typically think of I think and for me

00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,490
that's the question of sustaining

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,919
innovation right we built something cool

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,139
once got lots of users look that's

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,000
pretty awesome how do we keep doing cool

00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,399
things how do we sustain that innovation

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,099
is sustained that that creativity and

00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,599
that's actually really at the heart I

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,220
think of what's continued to happen here

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,020
with Jupiter it's really

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,510
at the heart of the energy the ethos in

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,860
the broader pie data Sify ecosystems so

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,330
when we talk about open source

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,830
sustainability and we think about it

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,590
only from the software maintenance and

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,780
the paying the starving devs angle we're

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,420
really answering the question of how but

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,470
if we want to address the why for me

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,770
that answer has always been around

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,320
sustaining innovation and so Jupiter

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,820
anaconda actually both suffer from a

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,610
very similar misconception that I've

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,850
seen out in the wild and that

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,430
misconception is that they're just tools

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:17,490
and I take the perspective actually that

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,010
Jupiter and anaconda are substrates for

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,960
innovation not just tools of course we

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,080
use them as tools right but they're

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,180
actually bigger than that and when

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,860
you're substrate you get misunderstood

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,290
by everybody in different ways right so

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,430
by people who are outsiders who are new

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,110
to this stuff right

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,460
they'll trivialize it'll say well the

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,460
notebook thing yeah it's a web front-end

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,930
yeah that's great but you know I got you

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,400
know Twitter I got medium I have other

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,930
web front-ends I use it's just a web

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,160
front-end where they look at anaconda

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,990
and they say well this is just a package

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,590
manager I've got YUM I've got this other

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,060
stuff it's a package manager and the

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,890
other way is that if they look a little

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,930
deeper or if they don't look deep deeper

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,280
they may actually mistake it mistaken

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,090
these substrate things for something

00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,290
much bigger than they are

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,410
don't mistake it for the whole mountain

00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,820
right they'll think that Jupiter is

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,169
pandas in math Hall lid or they'll think

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,440
that you can only do scikit-learn

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,580
if you use anaconda right and and that

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,950
kind of misunderstanding you know you

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,540
can you can sort of understand it saying

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,550
well these people are new and all the

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,100
stuff but that's definitely a common

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,750
misunderstanding but insiders people who

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,650
are of the community also can

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,660
misunderstand substrate and and the Mis

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,290
understand there is basically I think

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,700
tied to an under appreciation of how

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,520
critically important it is to have

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,710
common framework for the non-sexy stuff

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,469
for the baseline things right so the

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,110
Jupiter format the protocol the coms for

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,870
Tikal not very sexy critically important

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,240
anaconda the Conda package format not

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,460
that sexy it's not machine learning it's

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,020
not beating anyone it go but it's

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,870
actually critically important as well

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,540
and so that critical aspect is that

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,140
these these frameworks Jupiter anaconda

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,660
they stabbed

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,600
which this lingua franca that actually

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,370
allow a network of value to emerge

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,140
between creators innovators users

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,390
everyone that value network actually

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,100
sustains a continuous stream of

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,300
innovation if you didn't have a bazaar

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,130
if you didn't have a marketplace where

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,050
the people who can create and the people

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,780
who want to consume those innovations

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:19,140
can meet you don't get this kind of

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,970
positive creation of energy and so you

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,610
know I'm a metaphor I would use is that

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,440
you you have basically a scattered room

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,870
full of step stools but none of them get

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,580
you very high and if you actually have

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,290
some kind of format these baseline

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,730
compatibility things you can actually

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,410
start stacking them on top of each other

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,480
and you get a ladder and that's a very

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,520
very important thing and so the jupiter

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,470
notebook is one of these things I think

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,020
Legos minecraft they all have that cut

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,890
same kind of texture and so I think that

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:49,410
for the platforms like Jupiter anaconda

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,760
these kind of infrastructure things and

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,730
if you actually look broader right to

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,650
Jupiter to to condo forge the community

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,270
starting to pitch in and add to to these

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,920
kinds of things they're really the

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,380
products of community of movement

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,300
actually that's driven by a belief in

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,070
the empowerment of analytical thinkers

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,200
that's why people do this stuff that's

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,030
where they're stacking the steps tools

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,820
and and so the thing I would the the

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,200
parting thought I guess is that when the

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,790
when we look at the PI data in the

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,620
sci-fi ecosystems really growing in

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,990
popularity really becoming adopted

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,710
universally we're gonna absolutely

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,780
there's no question we're gonna

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,180
revolutionize data analytics and data

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,950
exploration for many many years to come

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,540
the potential is absolutely staggering

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,000
and it's gonna take a lot of work but as

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,990
we're doing that work we have to as we

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,400
participate in that community it's

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,890
absolutely critical for us to keep in

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,410
mind the why the purpose behind it and

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,600
for me that purpose that driving purpose

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,360
is always been it's always been about

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,360
ensuring that this open source value

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,520
network it remains open and that it

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,770
empowers innovation by a global

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,499
community absolutely everyone on the

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,559
planet thank you

00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:54,559
