so it's great to be here and I've heard

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,240
a lot of great words here that I think

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,920
make me even more so excited to be here

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,650
and I'm gonna quote Fernando from his

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,750
talk earlier that data science is a

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,080
critical skill for citizen of the modern

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,490
world to learn number two words that

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,010
I've heard that was that were really

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,810
critical were empowerment

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,670
democratization and which is precisely

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,130
what this talk is going to be about so

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,070
how did I come to this or to be part of

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,810
this community 2001 kind of like Wes

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,630
this is where I started getting

00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,520
introduced to the ipython world and for

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,950
very very practical self empowering

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,540
reasons which were the following I had

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,820
just finished a very very theoretical

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,890
PhD and was interested in developing

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,050
more practical skills that I could apply

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,670
in the real world and particularly I

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,510
wanted to apply some of my thesis work

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,460
to the analysis of sports and NBA data

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,780
well guess what back then this is not

00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,850
something you could do with languages

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,000
such as MATLAB so I was super excited

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,400
when I wrote my first scraper using

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,590
mechanized and beautiful soup and I was

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,590
literally like wow you can actually do

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,560
this so that's when a mission began - as

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,300
an educator how can i empower my

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,800
students especially students that are

00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,390
not traditionally computer science

00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,980
students to develop an interest in data

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,170
computer programming but with the

00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,910
important caveat that it is critical to

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,280
learning and educational research shows

00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,440
this it is critical to learning to

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,260
develop these interest in coding and

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,790
data in the context of applications that

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,460
interest the students themselves and

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,490
I'll go to an example in this talk that

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,800
shows that so the why part I shouldn't

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,130
have to convince this audience why that

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,510
how let me tell you so what did I

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,950
specifically do when I started my

00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,220
position as an assistant professor at

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,600
Harvard well I designed two courses my

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,220
discipline in training is signal

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,500
processing theoretical signal processing

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,240
and traditionally if you think about

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,560
Electrical Engineering or at least this

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,570
is how we think about ourselves and

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,030
computer scientists there's been this

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,520
divide in terms of how Electrical

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,810
Engineering taught and programming in is

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,370
thoughts so this is one a lot of

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,310
departments you will have ECE

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,810
departments

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,790
supposed to electrical engineering and

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,890
computer science department and I was

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,890
interested in bringing signal processing

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,980
and theory and coding and applications

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,360
within the confines of one class now

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,400
here's an important challenge that is

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,130
backed up by Education Research which is

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,530
that when in the context of a given

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,420
class you're trying to teach multiple

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,720
concepts that are challenging in

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,459
themselves so theory as well as coding

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,680
and data science there's a certain

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,650
amount of cognitive load that prevents

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,180
the students to learn optimally and this

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,220
is a cognitive load that I realized when

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,470
I started getting into this ipython

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,959
Drupa the world so what I thought would

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,989
be great to do would be to design a

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,730
platform that allows student not to have

00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,769
to worry about setting up their coding

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,780
environments a lot of the people in the

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,250
audience here are very seasoned computer

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,110
scientists who've been working at this

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,760
from a very early age so it comes

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,980
naturally to them to have to set up an

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,019
Ubuntu box with the right dependencies

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,080
and so forth picture an undergrad who

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,700
has never touched a machine before this

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,989
is something that leaves to a certain

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,570
amount of anxiety that I've actually

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,280
seen so how do you build courses that

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,459
bridge this gap between teaching theory

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,829
programming and applications to data

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,930
while providing a seamless platform that

00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:32,049
the students can plug into and focus on

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,880
learning the actual content of the

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,220
course as opposed to having to set up a

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,750
programming environment and one quick

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,280
way to summarize it was in a dinner

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,730
conversation that I had with one of my

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,680
undergrads when I told her where this

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,690
class came from and she literally said

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,220
so what you're telling me is that you've

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,530
designed the course that you would have

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,079
liked to take and that's precisely what

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,549
I did so this is about empowering the

00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,829
next generation of electrical engineers

00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,720
whatever your discipline is how do you

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:03,010
empower these people to get into

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,840
programming analysis of data so let me

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,780
talk briefly about what these two

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,209
courses are so these courses is two

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,299
courses engineering Sciences 155 and

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,920
engineering sciences 2-0 on on my slides

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,510
I don't have the official names I have

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,280
what I like to call these courses the

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,549
official names are for engineering

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,740
science 155 is biomedical signal

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,950
processing and what I like to call this

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,080
course is the labs in the world

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,780
and for those of you that are from the

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,490
90s you will recognize a parallel with a

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,610
spike Lee movie here in the name of the

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,490
course what are the topics that this

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,770
course covers so I'm training signal

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,170
processing so signals and systems

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,300
Fourier transforms convolutions how do

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,160
we design filters how do you process

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,590
time series there's also some basic

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,880
probability so over here already you see

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,800
that there's a certain amount of theory

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,570
that the students need to be comfortable

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,670
learning right what is the goal of the

00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,740
course from my perspective is to empower

00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,090
them to take this theory that is

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,180
traditionally taught in these courses

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,840
and make it more palpable and more real

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,790
to them how do we do this well we give

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,220
them this what I call the mercedes-benz

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,540
of wearables is the empirica a four so

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,060
this is a device to put in perspective

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,000
that costs about a thousand dollars and

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,790
this is a device that has four sensors

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,530
in them a temperature sensor an

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:26,300
electrical thermal response so a skin

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,430
conductance sensor accelerometers and

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,980
the last answer that this has is one

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,930
that is able to essentially measure your

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,910
heart rate so what do I mean by full

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,740
vertical integration so within the

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,360
confine of the course I want the

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,450
students to be able to do the following

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,100
I want them to a be able to collect data

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,990
on themselves I want this to be highly

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,850
personalised in other words I'm going to

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,710
teach you all of this theory and data

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,360
science on how to process the data but

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,710
at the end of the day I want the

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,170
questions that are going to be driving

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,120
the applications you're going to build

00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,770
to come from your own interests and I

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,140
will show you examples of projects where

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,330
the students actually precisely did that

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,980
so this full vertical integration where

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,560
the students to go from collecting data

00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,860
on themselves applauding them on the

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,210
cloud and processing it in the Jupiter

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,500
notebook and in the context of some

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,110
interesting projects that I'll show you

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,420
actually following through with taking

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,090
the output of their applications and

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,620
making real-time decisions with them in

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:27,450
an Internet of Things kind of way so the

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,780
second course is a graduate course and

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,850
this is a course that that I that I that

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,070
I I'm really glad I developed them that

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm really proud of so the official

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,250
title of the course is decision theory

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,990
the less official title of the course is

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,090
what I call rigorous data science so

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,620
what's very interesting about our

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,330
program at the School of Engineering and

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,520
Applied Sciences at Harvard and I think

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,340
this is becoming true of a lot of

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,140
programs and a lot of things that young

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,420
people want to learn now in engineering

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,580
disciplines is that the boundary between

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,470
people that do theory and want to

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,750
process their encoding has become very

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,460
very fuzzy and one of the key

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,690
philosophies in my class not don't

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,860
mentioned here I'll go through this one

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,020
in a second but one of the key

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,850
philosophies because I get computer

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,890
science students I get applying masters

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,540
I get buyer engineers I get pure math

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,740
students but one of the things that I

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,090
wanted to do in this class is that

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,580
you're not going to get a you're not

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,620
going to get away in my class by just

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,710
knowing a lot of theory or just knowing

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,510
how to code that there's a balance in

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,890
between that I want you to learn and I'm

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,380
going to design the course in such a way

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,590
so you get the usual suspects in terms

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,910
of topics regression classification

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,280
optimization and numerix we prove

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,750
theorems in the course and my goal is

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,930
essentially to get the students to

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,760
understand at a very deep level these

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,200
machine learning algorithms the

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,700
statistical inference algorithms that

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,220
you're going to be using at a very very

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,810
deep level what's happening inside but

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,880
at the same time to use this

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,370
understanding right to be able to

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,720
process data and do applications so for

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,520
this particular class in the context of

00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,950
the problem sets there's a mix of theory

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,620
and real-world data processing so

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,170
applications from sports data that I

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,360
mentioned earlier so tracking dynamic

00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,790
performance of sports Twitter data in

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,560
particular we've we we had a very very

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,900
nice assignment where we analyze some of

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,060
the tweeting patterns of the PR firm

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,680
that used to be behind President Obama's

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,780
Twitter account and saw some interesting

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,090
things that unfortunately I can't show

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,910
you here we process guys are data from

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,290
Old Faithful and neural data this is one

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,700
of the applications that I work with and

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,100
one important thing here is that when it

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,260
came to final projects I wanted students

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,610
and this is not typical if you come from

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,310
this world that I do from this academic

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,900
world I wanted the students to go from

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,919
question formulation this is the

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,460
question that I'm interested in

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,670
answering day the gallery so scraping go

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,560
find the data go clean it up right and

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,480
complete this with an analysis in the

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,649
droop in a notebook in other words I

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,029
wanted to teach these kids

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,589
not only theory but things that they

00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,990
would actually be able to use right away

00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:58,420
were they to get a job in a data science

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,100
context so how did we do this I'm going

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,769
to talk briefly about the platform that

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,990
we've developed at Harvard to accomplish

00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:08,499
this and to make this scale for a lot of

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,749
students and the engineer that primarily

00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:12,459
work on this is for our sadiq we give a

00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,720
poster about this yesterday and should

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,980
be somewhere in the audience I'll ask

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,139
him to raise his hand at the end of the

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:22,869
talk so again something I mentioned at

00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:24,100
the beginning of the talk the education

00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:26,410
research shows that when you're trying

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,850
to teach multiple things that have high

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,119
cognitive load in and of themselves

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,309
right it makes learning harder so the

00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:35,350
idea was that we're going to put

00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:36,879
together this platform that abstracts

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,910
away from the students how did you

00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,110
appear in notebooks or searched and

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,850
having to set up their environment and

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,790
from our perspective this is very

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,920
selfish as well this means that I or my

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,800
teaching fellows don't have to deal with

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,480
figuring out the machines for 30 or 40

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,709
different undergrads and when it comes

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,600
to our data science courses that have

00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,069
100 to 200 students we don't want to be

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,149
sitting there with 200 students and

00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:00,429
figuring out their dependencies

00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,079
basically so and then with this picture

00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,089
show essentially is how do you make this

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,279
more palatable and how do you create a

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,499
sandbox environment and I'm gonna make a

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,939
comment here I think which the

00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:12,249
traditional CS folks here in the

00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:14,800
audience will this will resonate with

00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:16,059
them I'm not suggesting this so the

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,509
building of environments that make

00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:21,790
things seamless for users as a long-term

00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:23,679
solution and in fact what we've seen in

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,360
the course is that once we give them the

00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,259
sandbox environment and the students

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,879
build this confidence very quickly they

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,920
stop using our platform actually and

00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,139
actually get this confidence to do it on

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,850
their own and understand how to set up

00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:42,160
the environment and so forth so how did

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,379
we do this so the first version of this

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,209
was in the fall of 2016

00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:50,110
right when I began my job as a faculty

00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:51,429
bad a bad idea bad thing to do and I

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,139
don't advise that when you're starting

00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:54,579
your junior faculty job but this is

00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:57,309
something I was excited about anyway

00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:59,379
so I went ahead and did it so the first

00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,120
and I can't do this justice so I'm gonna

00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,009
go quickly through it in the first

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,630
installment this was motivated and you

00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,700
should give

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,190
was where credit is due by some of the

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,200
work by the Berkeley folks specifically

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,050
a blog post that I read by Jess Hamrick

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,700
that discuss what she went through to

00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,380
design a system to teach to pin notebook

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,170
very briefly we had an Amazon machine

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,630
where multiple users in this particular

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,000
case 15 students had docker containers

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,710
and you can clearly understand how this

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,990
does not scare well to multiple classes

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,730
so that's the system that in your case

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,860
is on the left hand side and at the

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,650
moment the deployment we have is one

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,630
that scales very well and in this

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,600
particular case we have an Amazon

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:43,290
cluster manager that automatically spins

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,900
up different AWS instances on the fly

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,180
for students and automatically figures

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,310
out when the machine is not being used

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,350
what this does is that it allows us to

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,530
save on cost tremendously as I'll show

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:58,680
you in the next slide so comparing the

00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,910
two setups here very briefly so I'm just

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,490
going to go through the numbers here and

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,550
the cost in particular it cost about

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:09,330
three dollars per student for 30 hours

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,980
of use per week in our new sound so

00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,140
let's think about this for a second this

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:19,520
is cheaper than your fancy Starbucks

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:22,830
latte right for $30 per week of usage

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,110
right so I want to go to a quick example

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:28,110
of a project that shows this philosophy

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,240
in my opinion and so the students name

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,010
is Ryan Harvison he just graduated and

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,210
went over to med school unfortunately I

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,310
would have loved to keep him as a PhD

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,580
student and yes he is that big this is

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,210
not an optical illusion so Ryan was on

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,670
the football team

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,500
all right and Ryan took my engineering

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,410
science 145 class not knowing how to

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,260
code it all he did a project that was

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,880
about whether you could use this device

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,760
that we gave him to predict the outcome

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,930
of a basketball shot now again so this

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,820
goes back to a statement I made earlier

00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,440
about how it is important to connect the

00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,140
learning to the interest of the students

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,850
and what did Ryan do when I took the

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,460
class did a project he was just learning

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,020
things on there here and there but went

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,170
on to do an undergrad thesis with me

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:14,339
where he built a system from front to

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,690
end and I'm talking about hardware to

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,610
coding up the machine learning algorithm

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,510
in hardware

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:23,810
and designing an algorithm that

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,490
essentially sewing together by hand the

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,430
sensors on a sleeve that you could wear

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,769
and you take a basketball shot before

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,360
the shot goes in it would give you its

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,980
best guess as to whether the shot would

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,300
go in or not I mean this is tremendous

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,640
in my opinion and that's what I'm

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,990
excited with these kind of technologies

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,000
so to give you other examples of

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,380
projects here and how creative students

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,890
get when you put these tools in their

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,260
hands

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,149
we have students about we had products

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,440
about student stress monitoring some of

00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,140
the undergrads were interested in hey

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,130
can we use this device and

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,350
accelerometers or heart rate data in

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,740
there to figure out how stressed are we

00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,050
as undergrads on the grad student level

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,529
at somebody built a fantasy football

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,570
team recommender from front to end

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:07,540
scrape the data use mechanizing

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,040
beautiful soups that I love by the way

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,660
build his recommender and is actually

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,230
now using it in his fantasy football

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,329
team I had a very nice project about

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,860
modeling the Wolverine density in Norway

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,170
this is something the Scandinavians

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,850
think a lot about so Wolverine sightings

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,990
and it turns out that it's a very

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,640
interesting machine learning and

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,520
actually data gathering problem as well

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,990
so as far as course management interests

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,579
concerned I'm gonna breeze through this

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,290
real quick the nice thing about this

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:36,140
ecosystem is that now we're doing

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,770
everything on the cloud so what we have

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:43,279
access to or bitbucket teams essentially

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,750
right so we have a team for the course

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,000
in this particular case yes one five

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,480
five and different tracks that allow us

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,709
to deal with coursework management

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,240
delivering of assignments and labs to

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,920
the students as well as course material

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,660
and the students have different level of

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,670
access to this content one of the things

00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,899
we haven't figured out yet is automatic

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,760
grading and it's something that I would

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,010
love to talk to some of the folks in the

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,420
room about particularly because as I

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,130
mentioned in our case we're not just

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,370
creating code we're also grading

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:14,240
theoretical assignments and so forth so

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:16,339
the why again the only reason why I did

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,839
this is I wanted to build courses that I

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,810
would have loved to take as an undergrad

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,630
and it's it's it's very empowering for

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,660
me to see how well the students resonate

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,040
with these particular ideas so so to

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,830
conclude and this echoes

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,180
for an understatement so I know about

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,920
Fernando I have known about from mondo

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,110
for about 10 years I had never met him

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,500
before so it's it's very interesting

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,900
that we've developed similar attitudes

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,820
towards what it means to do data science

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,950
what it means to do science and so forth

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,710
I mean I do believe that in the future

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,750
so the ability to facility we did a

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,360
manipulation is going to be part of

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,580
literacy I this is something that I do

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,290
believe and I think one of the things

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,630
that this community can do right and

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,100
that it it is already doing

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,380
I mean case in point all of the talks

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,530
we've seen this morning right is that it

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,840
is developing these tools that empower

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,220
people outside of the mainstream to

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,010
actually take advantage of these tools

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,080
so as an example I'm partnering with the

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,420
Boston public school systems to see how

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,490
we can use deployments of Jupiter hub on

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,260
the cloud to teach data science in

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,000
underserved community and for very very

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,440
simple reason wealth of data are

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,330
available out there about communities

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,880
how do you now empower the communities

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,460
to plug into those data sets right to

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,320
make to make informed decisions based on

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,080
data about things that will affect their

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,460
quality of life right and as far as the

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,260
potential impact on education I've

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,760
already talked about this I mean I would

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,360
love to see the day where in most

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,130
universities undergrads come in

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,880
everybody comes in with an email address

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,260
and an account that is cloud based where

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,340
they have access to a Jupiter notebook

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,990
whether you're a government major

00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,420
whether you're a philosophy major and

00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,890
that this is part of your education from

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,410
the time you begin to the time you

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,270
graduate so the key lessons that I've

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,699
learned here is essentially that given

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,440
these tools the students just want to be

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,360
left alone I mean I was very saddened by

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,070
the fact that after the students got

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,720
facility with the platform I would

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:16,829
barely see anybody at my at my office

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,630
hours and it's very it's very it was but

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,970
but but they ended up doing great work

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,500
and I want to close I would have loved

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,209
to do a demo but I'm running out of time

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,449
unfortunately I want to close by

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,370
thanking the people that made this

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,440
happen in particular for us Sadiq that I

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,410
mentioned who is the engineer behind our

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,750
own deployment and as I mentioned we've

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,430
taken note of how to Berkeley does

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,010
things and a lot of other people do

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,290
things online so there are the people

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,050
that I want to acknowledge

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,270
I think this is very very important is

00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,250
the lady on the Left Diana Zhang she's

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,970
my grad student she's a CS PhD student

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,400
she's my first grad student and I was a

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,170
stress faculty starting my first course

00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,300
she was a data science student she was

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,650
excited about this and together we build

00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,550
his framework as to how we excited the

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,800
student and Jim Waldo who runs the

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,020
academic computing at C's for believing

00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,270
in this vision that we've deployed and

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,430
thank you for your attention and again

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,359
I'm excited to be here

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:19,359
