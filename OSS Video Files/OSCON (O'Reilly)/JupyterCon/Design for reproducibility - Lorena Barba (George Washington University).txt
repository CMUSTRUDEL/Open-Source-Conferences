thank you so much for that in for that

00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:07,069
heartfelt introduction I'm really very

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,450
very happy to be here

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:14,420
it's a long Salonga road to be in this

00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,580
conference I met Fernanda we were just

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,190
remembering in 2012 at a reproducibility

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,670
workshop and he gave a talk about

00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,440
ipython and I just knew immediately this

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,050
is what I wanted to use in my class

00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,780
starting a couple of weeks and so he

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,509
installed it in my laptop and I fired up

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,400
and went on a flight and a long-haul

00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,000
flight and started to learn how to use

00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,860
it right away

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,340
that was 2012 and I published my first

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,620
course with back then ipython notebooks

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,860
in 2013 and I had the opportunity to

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,530
give a keynote in 2014 at Syfy the Syfy

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,390
conference where I boldly claimed that

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,000
Jupiter was going to be the killer app

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,700
for education and here we are so I'm

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,850
very happy to now address a kind of a

00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,790
different topic thinking about the issue

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,460
of reproducibility of course you must

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,840
have seen all of them not going to bore

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,080
you with a slide with all of the

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,400
screenshots of the covers of topics

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,680
articles of repres about reproducibility

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,810
or the crisis and reproducibility in

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,850
science that have appeared in Time and

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,130
The Economist and on the New York Times

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,670
and etc but I want to tell you about the

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,530
beginning of this story this professor

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,080
that looks like Santa Claus is actually

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,270
an emeritus professor at Stanford in

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,490
geophysics and he pioneered the use of

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,090
computers for the processing and

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:41,420
filtering of seismic exploration data

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,430
from 1991 that's a long time ago he

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,590
required all of the thesis of his

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,080
graduate students to conformed lists to

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,470
the standard of reproduce ability which

00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,869
meant that the thesis of the students

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,990
should be reproducible programmatically

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,700
by just one single command all of the

00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,290
figures all of the scripts all of the

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,509
analysis should be possible to be

00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,299
completely reproduced by a single

00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:08,359
command now I guess if you're doing

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,369
simple analysis this might be possible

00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:12,889
in short time but if you're doing HPC

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,600
simulations that is quite another story

00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,770
but anyway this is

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,310
the beginning of the reducibility

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:22,430
movement and this group in particular at

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,120
Stanford developed their standards of

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:29,780
reproducibility with standard commands a

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,110
filing system a way to process and test

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,430
their software for reviews and I would

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,170
say that to this day

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,510
computational researchers are still

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:42,080
trying to measure up to Claire bouts

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,910
standard this idea that you can leave a

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,950
finished work in a state where

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,440
co-workers can actually reproduce the

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,800
complete calculation and workflow with a

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,080
single command and so this is the

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,240
beginning let me share with you the

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,190
definition of reproducibility that we

00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,350
use and we have adapted from a

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:05,900
publication that appeared already almost

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:08,360
10 years later by the group of clear

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,310
about and this definition is that

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,260
authors should simply provide all the

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,820
necessary data and all of the computer

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,400
codes to run the analysis again

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,970
recreating the results now believe it or

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,170
not this is still somewhat controversial

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:26,720
in some fields this is about the first

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,400
complication so the group of clear but

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,160
was the first to use reproducible

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,700
research as RSA as a phrase and this is

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,700
the first publication where they share

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,740
this idea we have adopted this

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,500
definition and we indeed in my group

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,690
share all the data all of the computer

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,850
code that we use to generate any

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:51,530
research results a few years later the

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,570
community has developed this idea of a

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,850
spectrum of reproducibility because one

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,980
thing is to share the computer codes and

00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,170
all the analysis but quite another is to

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,720
get to a point where some ideas can

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,990
actually do a new study that confirms

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,120
the findings the scientific findings of

00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:11,120
a previous result and this has been

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,970
called I'm sorry for the mic noise this

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,650
has been called replication so reaching

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,340
a full replication study means you

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,989
collect new data again you may do use

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,180
different methods perhaps but you can

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,130
confirm the finding so this is spectrum

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,000
from the minimum standard of sharing the

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,310
the data and the code to this final idea

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,140
of replication all of which is to

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:39,420
develop trust in the scientific process

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:41,070
and the findings and so this idea of

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,900
replication just to be on the same page

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,540
is to arrive at the same findings as

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,890
another study collecting new data

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,320
possibly with different methods of

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,930
course this is not always possible to do

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,180
for example if you're doing any

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,150
opportunistic epidemiological study you

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,040
might not be able to do collect that

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,560
data again because it happened at a

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,750
given point in time but on the other end

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,430
of the spectrum reproducible research is

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,820
really only limited by the time and

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,160
effort that we're willing to put in now

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,050
from the group of clare bird comes this

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,550
very interesting idea that i've been

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,230
thinking about and i wanted to share

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:21,120
with you he writes in different places

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,370
different forms of this this idea that

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,250
interactive programs he says very

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,960
harshly our slavery unless they include

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,780
the ability to arrive any previous state

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,460
by means of a script so this is a big

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,720
note of gooeys if you want to do

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:40,440
reproducible research I gave a one talk

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,390
where I to to a group of computational

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,130
scientists where I mentioned this and it

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,930
was big pushback from the group from

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,380
that from the audience so that's an

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,440
interesting idea on the other hand

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:54,740
Jupiter is of course a set of

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,900
open-source tools for interactive

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,850
exploratory computing so from Fernando

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,970
and Brian's opposed the State of Jupiter

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,100
that appeared in The O'Reilly blog they

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,960
say that project Jupiter aims to create

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,430
this ecosystem of open-source tools for

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,980
interactive computation and data

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,010
analysis where the direct participation

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,500
of humans in the computational loop

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,050
executing code understanding a problem

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:24,110
iteratively is the primary consideration

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:30,020
so this is the idea so well the idea of

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:33,510
an interactive tool in addition being a

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,640
tool that can help create this reputable

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,919
computational analysis is what I wanted

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,320
to think about today with you because

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,760
Jupiter is promoted as

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,700
lúcia for creating reproducible

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,800
computation and Annelle analysis some

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,190
seed as a means of putting into practice

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,830
the idea of Knuth of literate

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,870
programming where code is directly

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,990
annotated by a comprehensible

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,390
documentation the thinking process of

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,090
the human in the loop but some

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,740
researchers object this idea that

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,830
Jupiter is good for reproduce ability

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,020
they know it so-called problems with the

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,050
notebook because of the nonlinear nature

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,230
of the interaction of code cells and

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,970
ordered execution and other problems

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,010
with perhaps version control or not

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,230
being able to integrate at work for

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,170
workflow analysis so there's been quite

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,550
a bit of debate in some in some areas in

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,820
some communities about whether the

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,940
notebook is indeed a good tool for

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,640
reproducible research so what is this

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:38,890
problem here there's a this seems to be

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:42,770
a tension a contradiction between

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,420
interactivity and reproducibility indeed

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,610
interactive tools were seen by the

00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,890
pioneers of reproducible research as the

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,800
complete antithesis of reproducibility

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:58,310
so what makes Jupiter different than say

00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:01,250
the dreaded spreadsheet why is Excel

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,410
different than Jupiter what is it about

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,820
the interface the tool what is it about

00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:09,800
the design that is different here is

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:14,570
Professor UC Berkeley professor Phillip

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:19,910
start talking about Excel I'll just let

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:25,220
you read that 2014 he gives a talk about

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:28,370
using Excel for your analysis so he

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,940
wrote a blog post in 2014 titled

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,820
Sciences show me not trust me and he

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,560
offers a checklist of points that you

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,630
should follow for reproduce ability the

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,250
first point in his checklist is if you

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,520
relied on Excel for your computations

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,530
fail he explains that spreadsheets make

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,810
it very hard to do reproducible research

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,280
because it's hard to document and

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,960
reconstruct what you clicked and what

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,649
you didn't click in what order you did

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,740
it

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:57,079
the user interface conflicts

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,230
input-output code presentation and this

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,689
makes testing and discovering butts very

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:07,490
difficult so this is a problem this is a

00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:09,439
problem of design a problem of design

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,720
standing in the way of reproduce ability

00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:13,879
the second point that he makes is that

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,829
if you did not script your analysis

00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,749
including all the data and all the

00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:21,740
cleaning and all the managing and all of

00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:25,459
the other steps intermediate steps and

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,069
also that's a fail because if you so it

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,040
doesn't mean that you cannot use

00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:32,600
interactive tools or point-and-click

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,199
interaction in the intermediate steps

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,850
but it does mean that you need to at one

00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:40,879
point when you figure out what needs to

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,550
be done just put it all together in an

00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,869
automated process scripted out in a way

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,309
that you can confirm that you can

00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:49,389
regenerate the whole process from

00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:51,800
scratch and again this is a design

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:58,540
recommendation a workflow design

00:09:51,800 --> 00:10:00,829
recommendation now let me just make a

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,360
parenthesis to make sure that we

00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:04,279
understand why we care about this

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,379
problem the reproducibility is why has

00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,350
it hidden at new york times and all of

00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:11,329
this major publications well we care

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,999
about computational reproducibility

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:15,949
because we're using computing to create

00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:17,899
new knowledge we're using it as an

00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,990
avenue for scientific discovery

00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:24,350
it is so embedded in every single field

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,569
of science today it's really computing

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,660
is a form of learning and formal form of

00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:32,540
discovery we're creating knowledge and

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,949
this this is using computers as

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:40,850
extensions of our mind there's a whole

00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:43,549
field that analyzes representation modes

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,259
and how some people call it material

00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:47,059
intelligence for example algebra

00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:49,879
mathematics is material intelligence

00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,399
something that we use as extension of

00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:55,939
our minds to make comprehensible the

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,009
world we make science with computers and

00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:02,959
science demands reproducibility so this

00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:04,790
is why we care about it and science

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,860
there is

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,560
a theory of learning called connectivism

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,010
and one of the leaders of this theory

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,510
stephen downes a philosopher in canada

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:18,110
with george siemens they were the first

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:21,050
to do an open online course connectivist

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:24,500
it was called in 2008 way before the

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,950
MOOC craze in 2012 and they seed Steven

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,410
Dow says that science is a conversation

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,810
this is this is a simple statement but

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,570
is rather deep the idea that actually

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,600
you may do science by having in

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:41,360
conversation with perhaps your body of

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,150
knowledge with other singing scientists

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,810
or a conversation between scientists and

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:51,590
instruments and machines if this is the

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:54,400
connectivist explanation of what really

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,830
constitutes the process of doing science

00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,200
what is a conversation so here I take a

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:04,390
few minutes for to go in a little

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,490
philosophical dive with you this is I

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:10,760
guess inspiration from the field the old

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,200
field of cybernetics and Pacwa nathan is

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,550
happy probably in the room that I'm

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,470
mentioning cybernetics and so is what is

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,160
the conversation participant a has a

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,290
goal and contacts participate be

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,100
choosing a shared language it's no sure

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:30,890
language no conversation of course

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,530
participant B needs to engage if the

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:37,910
conversation is to continue has a

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:40,100
reaction and the goal of that loop is to

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,990
create a commitment and that's where

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,940
action happens if those participants

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,480
come to a commitment then action can

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:51,320
continue the agreement is what we are

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,700
looking after in a conversation and when

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,040
we agree in a community about a

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,040
scientific discovery this is a process

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,930
that also is occurring we can have

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,280
conversations about goals about means

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,500
and so on uh in the interface there

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,530
could be some tool aiding that

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,500
conversation now how do we design

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,660
conversations for reproducibility and I

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,520
only have a few minutes for this

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,399
presentation so I cannot really give you

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,220
any more than the syllabus for the

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,370
topic are thinking about it and there is

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,249
a very classic book by Herbert Simon who

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:30,639
was a Nobel Prize in economy got the

00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:32,920
Turing award and multitalented

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,980
a professor Simon from Carnegie Mellon

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,230
and he says that design is concerned

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,050
with how things should be with devising

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:44,319
artifacts for satisfying certain goals

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,899
everyone designs who devises courses of

00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,230
action to change existing situations to

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:52,029
make them better some inspiration we can

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,249
find also in the classic works of user

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:56,199
interface design this book by Schneider

00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:58,480
Braun is recommended it's a standard

00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:01,240
going back to 1986 for the first edition

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,029
and he says that tools that succeed have

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,089
to be comprehensible predictable and

00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:12,339
controllable so an obscure tool does not

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:14,709
satisfy this this trio responsibility

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,300
should guide design those who have

00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:18,129
authority and responsibility must have

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,199
awkward adequate levers levels of

00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:22,809
control who is the person who has

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:25,540
responsibility in the process of science

00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:29,559
and in ensuring reproducibility the

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,360
humans so we have this balance between

00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,220
the humans that need to be in control

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,250
and this idea of automation

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,449
we must not relinquish the

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,389
responsibility as humans and try to

00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:42,850
assign that to a tool the idea of

00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:48,579
ensuring human control while increasing

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:51,970
automation so here is a quote of this

00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:54,430
pair of cybernetics on 21st century

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,100
design design has expanded from giving

00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:01,120
form to creating systems that support

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,709
human interactions so this is what

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,420
should be our inspiration when thinking

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,660
about how we make tools that are going

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,069
to encourage reproducible research this

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,529
humans interactions that we're talking

00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:13,569
about are include thinking acting

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,589
together making commitments coming up

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,559
with a quitter

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,379
with a purpose feedback learning and so

00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:23,019
on I encourage you to have a look at

00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,929
this this idea of design from the

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:28,149
cybernetics point of view and and I

00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:30,670
invite you to think about Jupiter not as

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:31,930
a tool that is just for computing but a

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,570
tool that is an interface

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,110
to have conversations a shared language

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:40,960
if you will to increase agreement and to

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,330
lead to trust because reproducibility is

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,649
really about trust now I don't expect

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,270
that we are going to solve

00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,980
reproducibility with any approach that

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,500
takes away the responsibility of the

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,839
human participants that attempts to work

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,420
with 1-click I have seen several tools

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,860
that have been proposed that attempt to

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,010
solve the problem of reproducibility

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:02,290
with just one click and that is not a

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,580
conversation I have a button here I

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,500
press the button that's not a

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,120
conversation we cannot relinquish the

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,880
responsibility of the human in the loop

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,510
for reproducible research which is

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,310
essentially about trust so that's my

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,740
message today reproducibility is not a

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,140
one-click solution and we need we can

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,170
seek inspiration in several sources

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:26,230
about design to think about how to

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,630
accomplish the goals of Clare's clear

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,470
about group of achieving fully completed

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:36,720
reproducible computations thank you

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,720
