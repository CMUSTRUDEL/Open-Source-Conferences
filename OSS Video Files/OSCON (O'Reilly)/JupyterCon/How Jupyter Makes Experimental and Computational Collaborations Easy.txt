	00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,140
my name is Zach Saylor I'm a fourth year

00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,299
graduate student at the University of

00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,370
Oregon in the Department of Chemistry

00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:12,550
and biochemistry and I'm a computational

00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,589
Asst in a primarily experimental lab and

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,439
actually experimental department as a

00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:20,290
whole and so what I'm gonna share with

00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,930
you guys today is how Jupiter has really

00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,880
helped me bridge the gap between

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,680
computational ists and experimentalists

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,380
in a variety of different ways and so

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,750
this is going to be more of a high-level

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,460
talk not super technical about how to

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,920
implement these things but why you

00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,390
should and where you should and a couple

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,170
of the tools that I think are most

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:46,660
useful so all right so a little bit of

00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:48,970
background on Who I am so I'm gonna give

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,560
you a little bit of a timeline that

00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,850
picture was taken while I was at Cal

00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,370
Poly San Luis Obispo

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,500
I majored in physics there and

00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,870
unfortunately that photo has haunted me

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,590
ever since it's actually on our labs

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:05,379
website as a consequence of a practical

00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,090
joke I played on my PI so that is my

00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,420
profile picture if you go to my

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,500
professional lab website but so while I

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,890
was at Cal Poly I had the unique

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,979
opportunity to be taught by Bryan

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,860
Granger a longtime core developer of

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,870
ipython and the jupiter notebook he

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,620
taught me quantum mechanics and one day

00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,080
while we were sitting in quantum

00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,000
mechanics we were all looking each other

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,729
and talking about what the heck we were

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,560
gonna do with a physics major and so we

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,020
posed that problem to Brian in the

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,130
middle of our class and he said if you

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,900
want to know what you gonna do the

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,540
physics major come talk to me after this

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,540
class and in my office hour and I will

00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,720
tell you and I did that exact thing I

00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,460
guess nobody else took that advice but

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,950
he hooked me up with ipython and I got

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,780
to actually work directly with Brian as

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,970
a core developer for about a year a

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,580
little under a year which was great

00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,830
because it really launched my career and

00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,930
then so I did kind of start as a as a

00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,689
scientist developing software for

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,119
scientists and then for better for worse

00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,310
I decided to go to graduate school at

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,629
the University of Oregon in the

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,459
chemistry and biochemistry department

00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,499
just to change that fields a little bit

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,220
and kind of broaden my horizons a little

00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:18,310
bit and I ended up

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,230
in Mike harms lab there where we study

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,940
evolutionary biophysics and I'll give

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,790
you a little bit a background on what

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,490
that is so this is the harms lab that's

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,010
Mike on the far left here I'm next to

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,780
him you can tell we like to party we

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,480
show up with nerf guns to our lab

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,090
meetings and Luke over here I realized I

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,800
was two drinks in his hands one of them

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,970
I think is champagne and I don't we

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,730
weren't celebrating anything so I don't

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,790
know I had that but uh we study protein

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,340
evolution and we're really interested in

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,230
asking the question what are the

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,720
biophysical constraints that drive

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,630
protein evolution as they acquire new

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,250
functions over evolutionary time and

00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,660
that's a challenging question in a

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,600
really broad question we like to ask

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,300
those in our lab and I won't get too

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,610
much into the details of our research

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,980
because it's really outside the scope of

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,450
this talk but I will just briefly say

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,910
that all these people you see in this

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,680
picture with the exception of me and

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,150
there's a couple undergrads in this

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,740
picture that do a little bit of

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,489
computational work they're all

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:24,340
experimental lists and so they go out

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,170
there and measure these really complex

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,780
datasets and gather these complex

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,000
datasets basically what we do is we look

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,290
at families of proteins and align these

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,190
modern sequences we pull from different

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,290
species and we infer an ancestral state

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,480
of that sequence so we infer an ancient

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,620
200 million year old protein and we do

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,340
what we call resurrect it in lab and our

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,959
experimentalist will actually create

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,580
that protein synthesize it in our lab

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,470
and then measure its biophysical

00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,880
properties and then we will trace it

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,570
over evolutionary time

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,610
well that results in a lot of data and

00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,959
we really rely on computational tools

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,540
and resources to be able to take that

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,860
problem apart and dissect that so we use

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,290
all kinds of bioinformatics machine

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,000
learning and phylogenetics of the sort

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,480
and and so that's where I come into it

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,070
is to really work with them so just to

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,900
reiterate this I am purely a

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,550
computational list I don't do any lab

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,830
work it's actually pretty terrifying if

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,989
I'm in they'll have I've never touched

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,060
applied that before we actually have a

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:26,050
physical wall between the lab because

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm clumsy enough so I get this means

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,729
that I get the unique opportunity

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,470
to share code with Linda I'm gonna call

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,210
non coders so that I can broaden it a

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,220
little bit this could even apply to data

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,610
scientists talking to their clients so

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,220
it's really challenging sometimes to

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,479
have this conversation with them a lot

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,400
of them can be intimidated by something

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,130
like a terminal or command line or

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,380
scripts and so really trying to

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,410
facilitate this one-way direction

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,120
talking to them and then conversely they

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,340
have the benefit of having to try to

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,810
explain their complex experiments to a

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,840
guy like I said who's never touched a

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,199
pipette and so this really is a two-way

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,030
street

00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,610
and it turns out they're really good at

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,280
explaining experimental stuff to me the

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,250
ignorant computational list and it

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,580
really wasn't until a lot of trial and

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,919
error

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:19,360
that I could effectively communicate our

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,590
computational analysis back to them so I

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,090
want to take one step back and just

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,979
acknowledge those people so again the

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,440
harms lab for putting up with talking to

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,840
me a computational Innes we also have

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,949
two collaborations that are going

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,870
worldwide one is the Martin lab Rowena

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,090
Martin who's the young lady right here

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,440
in the middle at Australian National

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,699
University so this is really sweet

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,710
because we do really get to work from

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,000
two sides of the globe they are studying

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,550
a really interesting problem they're

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,159
studying malaria and how that parasite

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,750
has evolved over the last 50 years and

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,130
they can actually see as we treat it

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,669
with antibiotics how its acquired

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,310
resistance and it's crazy data so I work

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,810
with them and then do a lot of their

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,759
statistical inferences about that

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,250
dataset and then the second group there

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,830
is Susan marks e group at UC Berkeley

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,080
and they study a particular protein that

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,909
evolved a new way to fold a new

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,280
mechanism for folding and so that's an

00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:15,159
interesting evolutionary transition

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,020
again all experimentalists so I get to

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:19,630
be the IT guy for these these groups

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,969
which is a lot of fun all right so the

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,940
topic today I want to talk about is

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:28,060
sharing computational analyses with

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,490
non-computational collaborators and

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,130
these are a list of challenges that I've

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,009
experienced and I'm just going to list

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,440
them out number one is just getting code

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,520
to run on someone else's machine

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,710
especially when they have no

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,110
computational experience it turns out a

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,790
tournament

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,250
like I said is very intimidating to

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,600
someone who's never programmed before

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,430
not because they're dumb just because it

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,360
is an intimidating environment the first

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,800
time you see it and so always trying to

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,430
work with them on that it can be

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
difficult

00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,480
the second is setting up the environment

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,510
so installing Python has become really

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,300
easy recently it didn't used to be and

00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,890
and versioning Python but there's even

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,900
that extra load of getting dependencies

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,970
to install and work properly especially

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,670
if we create libraries and api's

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,050
in-house in our lab sometimes that

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,420
requires you know a little bit extra

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,480
attention and getting it stable and on

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,990
someone else's machine is another

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,610
problem number three explanation beyond

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,710
Docs means it turns out that my

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,660
experimental collaborators do not like

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,810
receiving a Python script with

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,910
docstrings and comments only baked into

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,320
the source code they want something

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,620
that's a little bit more human readable

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,990
and something that they see often so

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,740
some sort of plain text view obviously

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:48,890
is attractive and then this is kind of

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,000
an extra added bonus but the other thing

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,560
that they don't find useful is if I just

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,530
send them a script to one running out

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,630
one analysis on one particular data file

00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,630
they gave me we really want to allow

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,040
them to receive our programs if as low

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,350
of a barrier as possible and then be

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,900
able to try it on many data sets that

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,280
they have and so some sort of easy

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,650
interaction that we can give them

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,810
without there being any extra code that

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:15,200
they have to write would be a plus and

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,880
so the theme of these four things is to

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,070
come up with a way to get code and

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,270
programming out of the way and just get

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:25,130
them interacting with their data as

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:27,380
quickly as possible all right so the

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,630
plan for this talk going forward is to

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,510
highlight how Jupiter and different

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,220
pieces within the Jupiter sphere bridges

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,260
the gap between coders and non coders

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,700
and so this is kind of an outline of

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,520
where I'm going to go for the rest of

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:44,000
the talk so I broke it up into two parts

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,370
in the first part is how we can better

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,290
collaborate with non coders so this is

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,240
kind of locally maybe this is lab mates

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,820
in your in your grad students in your

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,840
lab or alternatively external

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,060
collaborators you know in another lab

00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,940
that you're trying to write analyses for

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,070
so I'm going to touch on the notebook

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,300
and none of these things you know we've

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,710
all heard of all these things throughout

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,540
this conference already so this isn't

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,820
new but I'm gonna just try to spin it in

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,030
this light of addressing this problem of

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,500
collaborating so the notebook for for

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,870
explaining and analyzing and exploring

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,740
data ipython widgets to interact with

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,480
the data and Jupiter hub which is really

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,360
maybe my favorite part of this

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,300
particular first part which allows us to

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,940
do things like pass data around with a

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,920
nice GUI interface share data in that

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,380
way and also get notebooks up and

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,590
running out of box to do any of the

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,870
managing of environments I could do that

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,720
on my end as the expert as opposed to

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,370
the expert and then the part to you is

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,550
really going to be turning this around

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,410
and collaborating with the scientific

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,210
community which means once you're ready

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,520
to share this data with other people and

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:57,210
put this out there in public for the

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,190
scientific community to see this is kind

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,220
of a couple tools you can use to do that

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,790
effectively and and reach a broad

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,000
audience

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,230
so obviously github we've all know I'm

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,350
gonna talk about how you can use that

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:14,430
for notebooks and be viewer and the

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:17,520
binder service okay part one so

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,500
collaborating with non coders so to a

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,140
computational is I define the notebook

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,230
as this interactive computing

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:28,740
environment or document for exploring

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,620
data so in this next video I'm gonna

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,060
fire up a notebook and I'm not live

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,970
coding this I do not program this

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,680
quickly I just want to show kind of the

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,600
I want you to see the movement of the

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,790
notebook as it's being written so it's

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,570
just a screencast of me writing a simple

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,850
analysis to fit a spectra so this is

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,820
just made up data but what I want to

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:54,920
highlight here is that the notebook to a

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,970
coder has this really nice fluid

00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,470
environment where you can explore the

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,660
data you can interact with it you can

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,960
write a chunk of code really quickly

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,080
test it out go back fix something and so

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,710
it leads to this nonlinear workflow that

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,420
I actually believe is really

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,790
powerful for a data scientist for a

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,340
computational scientist who really wants

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,130
to just explore data kind of dirty quick

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,510
and dirty in real time I've also heard

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,890
that it's argued that this might

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,620
actually be a dangerous feature of the

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,480
notebook because what happens is you

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,250
accidentally write something that lives

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,070
in your namespace delete that cell and

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,450
then it lives there continuously until

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,740
you restart the kernel and then it gets

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,690
you in trouble later maybe you have it

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,490
in another spot in your code so you

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,440
could argue either way but at the end of

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,290
the day you always go back you hit that

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,120
kernel restart run all to make sure that

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,790
it works in a nice linear fashion and

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,560
that's what you pass to your

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,930
collaborators and that's where they'll

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,670
make the last point which is this simple

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,370
reproducibility at the end of the day

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,800
you if you can get this thing to run

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,030
just by clicking go that's a really nice

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:05,950
document to hand off to your

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:09,040
collaborators cool so to a non

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,770
computation list the notebook is just

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,080
this interactive data document that

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,730
happens to have some code in it so when

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,890
I pass these off to my collaborators I

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,470
actually often tell them to completely

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,960
ignore the code cells just read the text

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,280
whatever I have written to you that

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,770
explains what's going on underneath the

00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,810
hood and then usually which I didn't you

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,720
didn't see quite in that video but I

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,250
expose some sort of widget or something

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,660
that you can interact with it allows you

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,830
to get away from having to hard code

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,720
parameters in or input in you just run

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:46,330
it through a widget and and that's a

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,450
familiar interface for them so that's

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:52,420
what I'm going to show here all right so

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:57,820
this is the notebook that I created on

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,690
the last slide and the nice thing some

00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,130
of the nice things that the notebook

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,570
provides of course is that we have these

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,520
markdown cells that are very human

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,380
readable like I said you can tell them

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,570
to ignore the code just look at the text

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,480
that you see that looks like normal text

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,490
to you not commented out the other thing

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,890
that the notebook provides is this

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:18,550
beautiful rendering if you use pandas

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,410
rendering of data frames which looks

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,920
just like an Excel spreadsheet so again

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,170
it doesn't scare away

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,029
a biologist that I interact with who use

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,690
Excel sheets almost explicitly still

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:32,660
unfortunately you got your plots in line

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,570
of course you can explain the map that's

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,610
going on underneath hood using law tech

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,630
so we all know this already but I just

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,459
want to highlight those are the things

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,380
that that your experimentalist and your

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,449
non coders actually really appreciate

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:50,470
you're not handing them a Python script

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:50,470
with this code just baked into it okay

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,769
okay the next thing oops to a

00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,149
computational estai Python widgets so

00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,130
this is speaking from the perspective of

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,019
a user of ipython widgets not a

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,699
developer so I'm not talking about the

00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,010
internals we could go on for days about

00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:08,690
how those are written but to you as a

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,570
user or a computation list

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,730
they really just provide a toolkit for

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,029
simple to create you eyes that you can

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,170
expose your collaborators to and then

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,230
they don't have to worry about coding at

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,000
all you basically take out the

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,290
programming for them and allow them just

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,649
to interact with these interfaces that

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:32,050
are really simple and so that was in

00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:32,050
that going back to that notebook sorry

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,680
at the very bottom there I have this

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:39,560
nice ipython widget the first time I

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:43,579
tried to fit this curve with just a

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,560
normal cycle urn or sorry SCI PI

00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,620
optimized function curve fit function

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,300
it didn't optimize we gave it bad greta

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,279
guest parameters and this is one of my

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,149
favorite parts about ipython widgets

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,250
especially when I'm giving it to my

00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:56,329
collaborators because it always is

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,040
annoying when you're trying to punch in

00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,660
guest values on a fit I mean this is a

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,420
simple one we should be able to fit no

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,399
matter what but I find it's always hard

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,990
to try to sweep through guest parameters

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,569
manually and so you can just create a

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,980
simple ipython widget and you can see

00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:12,709
this happens to fit right when I launch

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,880
the widget but there are times where you

00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,709
know you hit that regime or it doesn't

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,690
fit and so you can use these iPhone

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,300
widgets as a UI to quickly fit your data

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,819
which is really attractive not just to

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,490
me as a developer but also to my

00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:28,430
collaborators one step further I have

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,839
another notebook where I push that so I

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,519
should have ran all these before I

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,200
pushed that widget one step further

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,010
and if you notice this code that I have

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,810
inside this widget is nothing more than

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,339
what I put up here in these cells I just

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,380
kind of put it in under this function

00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:47,170
and then wrapped it with ipython widgets

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,089
interact so it's really no extra

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,890
overhead to you as a computation list

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,570
and provide this but what comes out the

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,010
other end here is all of a sudden they

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,490
can start loading in different spectra

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,810
and fitting those with these widgets so

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,560
this is the kind of front-end that I

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:04,630
provide to collaborators that again kind

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,709
of cuts out code and allows them to go

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:10,709
straight to analyzing their data cool

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,970
so this to a nun computational acai

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,319
Python would just really allows them to

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,930
change the output without writing any

00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,730
extra code and that that is a huge plus

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,490
I promise you when you start interacting

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,220
with people who don't like to code or

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,420
don't have the capacity code when

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,579
they're worrying about their experiments

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,750
all right and then the last thing in

00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:42,720
this part is the Jupiter hub so in our

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,100
lab we launched a Jupiter hub to provide

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,019
an environment for all of my

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,089
computational West co-workers and lab

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,769
mates so they can do their own analysis

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,060
if they want to but they don't have to

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,350
worry about installing anything on their

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,540
computer setting up any Python

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,430
environments I put all that heavy

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,990
lifting on me as a computational is

00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,639
because I'm supposed to be the expert in

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,889
the room so just like I don't ask them

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,930
to or they don't ask me to troubleshoot

00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,939
their experiments which would be a bad

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,530
idea I don't ask them to troubleshoot

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,260
their computational side I handle it for

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,870
them and so we just launched on a simple

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,350
abouttwo server Jupiter hub out of the

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,750
box

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,699
Pam Authenticator with and we just give

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,409
them all sister you system user accounts

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,579
and that's what the dubidouxs hub

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:28,919
becomes for us is really just this

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:30,690
multi-user hub and so as they admin to

00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,580
this as the computation list I fire up

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:36,240
an account and maybe I'm collaborating

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,880
with someone so for example our group in

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,640
Australia sorry I did slow internet when

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,500
I was recording this oh and we use

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,610
Jupiter lab - and our Jupiter hub which

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,900
I was told as an adventurous move so if

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,080
you're not you set interface that's the

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,299
next generation of notebooks but you can

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,010
see there's a panel that comes provided

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,080
right here in that jeweler hub that

00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,909
shows all your system users we go on

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,260
here and we create user accounts for all

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:02,940
of our collaborating groups

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,850
so Susan marks each group we have one

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,730
and Romina's group and I created a

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,470
Jupiter con on this particular example

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:14,190
but when I have that available to me I

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,780
write my analysis on my account I just

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,340
pull up the terminal and I just move

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,400
that analysis right over into my

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,630
collaborators account so then all those

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,880
files and everything that I built for

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,830
them is already there I've also

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,720
installed everything on their account

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,100
for them all the Python environment all

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,600
the dependencies they need to run that

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,370
note

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,350
I've loaded all the data in there and

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:38,270
it's ready to go so to a new to a

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,560
non-computational Ennis I believe the

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,810
Jupiter hubs should be defined as the

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,690
best thing since sliced bread because

00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,430
here's what they get to do they see this

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,260
interface I give them the URL the static

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,000
URL that we have for our bintu server I

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,090
give them the credentials that we gave

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,330
them for their lab to log into this data

00:18:52,090 --> 00:19:00,280
they fire it up and they'll see when

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:03,800
they enter their lab the exact folder

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,240
it's experimental warning there that I

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,770
gave them right there so that's the

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,480
notebook or the folder that I moved over

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,390
they can open up the notebook that I

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,390
gave them and it runs ready to go so you

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,580
just click go and so for them there's no

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,110
extra overhead of trying to learn and

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,550
setup a computational environment

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,190
there's no terminal if you notice that

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,480
it was all GUI front-end interfaces the

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,430
other thing is I don't show in this

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,340
video but of course there's a nice

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,020
upload button here so when they get data

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,240
they just keep adding it up to there and

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,100
then I can hop on and do an analysis on

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,110
that data and then post it for them to

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:40,670
use so it's really the Jupiter hub that

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,950
allows this to happen so this is kind of

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,420
our just a map of our connections as

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,150
collaborators and we have many more this

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,770
is just the ones that I'm particularly

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,320
affiliated with but it's really these

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:55,010
three tools that have led us collaborate

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:59,210
really on a global scale so conclusions

00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,830
for part one I'm just gonna check these

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,790
off we got code running on someone

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,380
else's computer who doesn't have

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,420
computational experience they just

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,920
logged into a Jupiter hub with

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,770
credentials we sent them and it was

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:13,090
ready to go next is setting up

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,110
environments again did that as well

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,610
explanation beyond dock strings that

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,710
wasn't a very pretty notebook because I

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,300
wrote it very quickly but you can see it

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,890
was really easy to follow I use markdown

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,230
cells they didn't have to look at the

00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,390
code we even actually have an extension

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,070
that we wrote that just hides the code

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,680
cells and just print it prints out the

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,910
document with the widget ready to go so

00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,840
they could try and loading in their

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:37,550
different spectra and fitting it and

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,360
then of course the ipython widgets we

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,380
use to allow them to load and data

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,130
filter through different data sets try

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,100
different

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,570
fitting models and interact with their

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,750
data directly without having to write

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:54,350
code alright so part two is

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,340
collaborating with a scientific

00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:01,460
community and so I just want to say to

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,230
start Jupiter since I have been away

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,230
from it actually and been more of a

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,490
fanboy rather than a developer her

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,560
really makes publishing reproducible

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,200
code analyses easier than ever before

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,210
and I'm gonna prove that in this part

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,060
but specifically I'm just going to

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,410
mention these three services there are

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,470
other services that I actually just

00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,730
became aware of that should fall in this

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,790
list I just didn't get to add them to my

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,010
talk but for all of this I'm gonna just

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,160
use a paper that we wrote earlier this

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,560
year as an example that is published in

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,240
genetics and and so along with it we

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,190
published a set of reproducible Jupiter

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,980
notebooks that recreate all the figures

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,140
in that paper so you can just download

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:48,080
them and run them and get them up and

00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:49,400
rolling right away and so you're sorry I

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,380
should you can't see that because it's

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,430
really small let me pull up

00:21:50,380 --> 00:22:00,530
here's paper on genetics you'll see

00:21:52,430 --> 00:22:01,850
under our methods section you'll see the

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,230
computational methods section that talks

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,700
about the software we use and then a

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,710
data availability and right there is a

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,630
github link directly to the notebooks

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,580
for this which you can click in that

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,620
article and it takes you directly to a

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,060
repo I'm going to show you also how

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,270
statically rendered versions of the

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,770
notebooks and runnable versions of the

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,150
notebooks through the binder service

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,550
which I'm going to highlight here in

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,620
this talk so this means that to recreate

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,120
this paper that we published earlier

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,950
this year you don't have to download a

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,720
single thing you just click on these

00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,280
badges down here and you can get them

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,600
fired up and running and you can test

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,340
and make sure you get the exact same

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,020
results that we do you can also try

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,020
other analyses in those notebooks

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:46,039
so just to define github in this context

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,899
really provides a sustainable home for

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,649
notebooks specifically the notebooks

00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:52,490
you're trying to share with the

00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:54,049
scientific community it's free it

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,270
renders notebooks statically that's kind

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,080
of I think only a year old feature which

00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,760
is really sweet

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,510
github recognizes the importance I think

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,770
of Jupiter notebooks 3 downloading

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,419
notebooks is easy you actually don't

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,580
have to have a github account to

00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:10,880
download notebooks from a repo you just

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,200
look up the repo and grab them and so

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,299
that's really nice for people who aren't

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,740
again gonna be github users who just

00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:19,850
want to look at our analysis and run it

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,860
we're not the only people who've written

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,510
reproducible notebooks with their

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,820
publications there's an entire list

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:28,100
devoted to this my slides by the way are

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,690
also available on github but this is a

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,179
link that will take you to a whole list

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,610
of papers that have been written in

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:36,890
Jupiter notebooks and so this is kind of

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,779
a new emerging thing in the in the you

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:43,460
know days of open science that are

00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:46,279
starting to arise and take off and be

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,289
viewer is just a service that allows you

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,899
to share static notebooks people use

00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:52,429
these for blogs all the time so you can

00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:54,740
just go to this website it looks like

00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:58,850
this and it's really easy you can just

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,200
point to a github repo right here and it

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,130
will fire up a static version in your

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,169
notebook we actually have them for our

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:08,510
paper here so you can see oh I want to

00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:12,380
see what figure 3 looks like for this

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,909
paper if I can get Internet and it will

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,100
just take you to a statically rendered

00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:19,279
version of that notebook I won't wait on

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,840
the internet yeah there we go so you can

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,100
use them again to share your now sees in

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,929
a static way if people don't have any

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,850
interest in running it but they just

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,850
want to read about it it's all there

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,090
so I just want to say that the MV viewer

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,280
is great for supplements and actually

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,410
turns out I think it's a little bit of a

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,570
myth that papers won't take these as

00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,100
supplements and a lot of the journals

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,309
that we interact with as long as you

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,260
have a sustainable home like github they

00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:50,700
will will take this as a reasonable

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,299
place to serve your data and host your

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:58,320
data and so you know that know that

00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:01,200
going into it and then the last service

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,540
I want to highlight is binder which is

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,860
currently in beta version it had it's it

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,940
was up and running for about a year and

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,470
then I think they got a lot more traffic

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,140
than they were expecting and so they

00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,809
took it down and decided to rebuild it

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:16,230
but this is amazing because now you can

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:17,940
share executable notebooks without it

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,590
within the browser without anyone having

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,240
to download anything it's already up and

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,230
running the vironment is set up for you

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,419
and that's at beta my binder dot org it

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:30,210
looks something like this you're just

00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:32,429
loading a name of your github repository

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,860
or you can link to some other repository

00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,419
and you can say a path to a notebook and

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,299
you just click and launch and it will

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,700
fire up it will grab your notebooks from

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,919
wherever they are scrape them build a

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,230
nice instance to run those notebooks and

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,049
fire them up in a Jupiter hub actually

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,700
underneath the hood and yeah have

00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:52,169
runnable notebooks right there without

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,570
them having to install anything and you

00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:57,320
can ask many people to fire them up in

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,320
parallel if you want

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,060
so MB viewer is good for supplements

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,530
binder is even better because now your

00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,210
notebooks are no longer static viewable

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,830
documents they're actually runnable so

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,030
you can use them to recreate analyses

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:16,160
that were actually published so I

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,260
suggest that at this point there really

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,540
is no excuse to write a paper that's not

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,430
reproducible everything should be

00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,800
reproducible nowadays with this kind of

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:27,380
technology especially the things within

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,060
the Jupiter sphere so that's kind of a

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,640
point I want to make very very clear and

00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:35,270
then I'll get off my soapbox is that

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,610
reproducibility is so easy nowadays that

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:42,770
we should all be doing it and I will

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:49,190
prove it so I'm gonna go ahead and take

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:51,620
that notebook that I wrote super fast

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,470
that you saw me do live coding I have

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:59,510
that whole repository right here it's

00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:02,290
now it is a git repo you can tell I ran

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,290
things let's commit

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,470
all right I'm gonna mirrorless and

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,150
create a new github repo fresh right

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,679
here right so I have I'm just going to

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,100
name it Jupiter Cana reproducible

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,100
notebooks

00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,900
we'll write a little description fire

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,900
that up

00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:48,990
we can grab this Oh actually I think I

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:53,340
already have this all set up you just

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:57,800
add it to a remote like I have here and

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,800
if I just push this repo up to that

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:13,440
you'll see it is all ready to go here I

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:16,620
can take that repo point binder to it so

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,940
I want you to open up the particular

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,530
notebook I'm interested in and just

00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:28,650
launch it that's gonna take a few

00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:32,160
seconds maybe not you can come back to

00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,630
that and in seconds we've taken an

00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,550
analysis that we just wrote in a few

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,920
minutes we've pushed it up to github and

00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,240
now it's gonna be shared publicly that

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,670
people can run in the browser without

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,670
ever downloading it without ever getting

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,100
python set up on their machine and it's

00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:51,180
ready to go so while we let that build

00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,680
up continue on and come back to it but

00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,660
this is what I want to round it off and

00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,230
just say this this was to highlight what

00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,000
I said earlier

00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,550
Jupiter makes reproduce publishing

00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,400
reproducible analyses so easy easier

00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,890
than ever before that this really should

00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,900
be kind of a new norm in moving forward

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,250
as you're making a analyses and you're

00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,020
sharing things not just with your

00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:14,430
collaborators but with the scientific

00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:17,220
community so just to touch on things

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,080
that we've talked about so first part

00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,370
was collaborating with non coders these

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,980
are the kind of three things and there's

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:26,040
many more like I said tools underneath

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,570
the Jupiter ecosystems you orbit as I

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,480
call it here that can help you in this

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,350
but uh and then part two was

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,020
collaborating with a scientific

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,300
community and so if we go back to this

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,390
man binders working a little slow and

00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,400
overload right now it's so easy to go

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,110
from a analysis that you just wrote

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,860
in-house to being able to share it

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,860
across a bunch of machines

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,960
all right so final conclusion Jupiter

00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,150
makes collaboration easy that was my

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,070
title and the way it does that is by

00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,990
allowing programmers to program it

00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,550
allows us to take the heavy load setting

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,020
up environments getting things ready for

00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,270
our collaborators and allows the

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,310
collaborator collaborators to focus on

00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,810
their work to focus on their experiments

00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:09,330
and then when they need to look at and

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:14,490
interpret the data its ready to go ready

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:17,760
to fire up and just before I finish here

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,230
I want to mention two things I'm pretty

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,680
excited about in the context of this

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,540
problem

00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,000
Jupiter lab which we've seen some

00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,350
amazing demos is phenomenal it's been

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,900
really fun to watch them develop that

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:30,420
I've also been able to write help write

00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,400
a couple extensions which has been quite

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,500
fun it's amazing like I have a multiple

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,470
sequence alignment I didn't write but

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,820
helped write that allows you to view

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,820
that right there next to your notebook

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:45,180
if you're analyzing sequence data and

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,460
then of course Jupiter Google Drive is

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,410
kind of a glimpse at what's going to be

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,680
I think the future of Jupiter notebook

00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,120
which is this real-time collaboration

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,380
notebook environment where you can

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,480
actually have multiple people working on

00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,620
the same notebook which will be really

00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,790
huge in the context of everything I

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,010
presented here because I showed you that

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,720
I had to move analyses between accounts

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,850
and get them fired up on their own

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,070
machine this will be I can just work

00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,890
directly with them with a little google

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:13,290
chat window next to it and walked them

00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,730
through analyses in real time and so

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,910
that that's gonna be really huge keep an

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,140
eye out for that with that I just want

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,450
to thank you that's my information on

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:26,400
Twitter github and you know unless just

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:28,460
see so this was that binder that you saw

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,490
so now it's we're able to run it

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,940
dependencies are all set and just for

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:38,850
fun and for a proof of concept I think

00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,110
you guys should all run it too you can

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,820
either go to that github repo there's a

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,830
little badge on it there's also you can

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,290
go to this bitly link because I couldn't

00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,490
come with a short enough link if you go

00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,440
to that right now you can run that a

00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,370
notebook that we just wrote here oh no

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,370
it's not working

00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,490
Oh bummer dang it

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,900
live demoing is always troubling but we

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,150
can we can see if it works afterwards

00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,350
but so yeah with that I just want to

00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,400
thank you guys for coming my talk thank

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,530
you to the organizers for giving me this

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:24,780
opportunity to speak here and I'll take

00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:24,780
any questions yes yes yeah yeah

00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:47,440
yes right right so the question was do I

00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,210
basically tell my collaborators

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,100
beforehand how to get the notebook

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:54,309
started so they can start using widgets

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,250
properly is that right so yeah so I

00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:00,130
always make it so that when I pass a

00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:03,340
notebook off you click run all from the

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:05,200
start and then everything lives as is I

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,830
mean that might not work for everyone's

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,960
workflow though so I I purposely put

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:13,029
things in linear fashion and things that

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,559
I've analyses that I've done are okay

00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:15,519
with that you can you can have things

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,350
one year like that

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,240
and so I just tell them go in click run

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,240
all and then start playing with widgets

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,350
right yeah usually I do so I usually

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,049
create a unique widget for each portion

00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,429
that their they want to look at so it

00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:38,080
will only control whatever is right

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:39,549
below it it won't control some of you

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,340
that's that's higher up on the notebook

00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:44,470
or lower in the notebook yeah

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,799
and I think for the sake of simplicity

00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:53,220
it might be worth doing that for a class

00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:56,220
yeah for for experimentalists oh yeah

00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,220
yeah

00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:04,820
but the piece or type of interactions

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,820
are going

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,130
yeah so so it depends it depends on the

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,390
context so in lab you know with my my

00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,640
lab mates it's really easy for them to

00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:25,260
just turn their chair around which

00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,840
actually we don't do we

00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,310
slack each other even though like like

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,560
Luke's sitting right here you could just

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:37,320
say it to me

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:38,640
but yeah so in in the lab we it's

00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,280
usually just we just say it to each

00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,050
other but for like the lab in Australia

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,640
you know I can't be the IT guy that

00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,460
flies out to Australia to fix things for

00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,550
them and so for us it is usually just

00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,190
communicating through email we also set

00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:57,390
up get ER channels on certain projects

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,430
like we have notebook repositories for a

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,710
particular project living on github that

00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,850
we are using for our collaboration and

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,950
then we set a git er account on that

00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:08,250
that we can communicate through so

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:11,250
that's one strategy there's talk that

00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:14,390
Jupiter lab will have chat room like

00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:18,110
extensions and that will be the dream

00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,110
that I hope we get to you

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,440
how did I do it yet yeah so there yeah

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,530
there is actually a Jupiter lab

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,830
extension a Jupiter hub Jupiter lab

00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,300
extension on github yeah so if you look

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,990
I think if you go to the Jupiter hub

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,840
document it's it's very questionably

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,730
documented but there is a spot in like

00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,160
the the frequently asked questions

00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:49,010
section I think of Jupiter hub that says

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,590
how do you get Jupiter lab running if if

00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,500
Jupiter lab is really alpha the

00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:57,830
extension is really really alpha so like

00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,720
there's definitely some sketchy things

00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,820
that go on but that's okay I mean it'll

00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,640
it'll get there and fortunately I work

00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:07,310
with people that don't really care I

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,880
mean to some level they just want to run

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:14,120
notebooks and so it's okay but if you're

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,590
if you have a team of technical people

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:22,720
they might get frustrated because it is

00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:22,720
pretty unstable right now yeah yeah

00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:35,680
I eat so it should actually work no

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:38,800
problem because well so it depends I'm

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,300
not super so to answer your question so

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,790
sorry I'll repeat your question I should

00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,380
have done that earlier but have I use

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,810
any third-party extensions with the

00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,750
binder service I know that they allow

00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,670
you to install them I mean I think it's

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,140
just Conda install is how they do all

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:57,130
their stuff so as long as Conda can

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:59,680
build it it should be fine but you know

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:12,540
it depends on what that extension has is

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:12,540
its installation yeah yep yep

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,700
yeah so that this is not a great

00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:20,270
solution to roll out from big data

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,360
problems I think I mean you always have

00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:25,250
that problem though if you're if you are

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,450
working for you know if you publish a

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,850
paper and you have a big data that goes

00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,590
with it they're gonna ask you to put it

00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:33,440
somewhere that's going to sustain you

00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:36,290
know if you sustainable and so currently

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,400
we don't put it like on github if we

00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,290
have anything that we need to roll out

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,750
with large data it's going to live on

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:45,200
our university server and then we do

00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:47,030
provide a bit of front-end for that that

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,750
takes a lot more work obviously it's not

00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,700
just out of the box yeah so I don't I

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,620
don't know of a better solution

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:57,950
currently that exists like binder won't

00:37:54,620 --> 00:38:00,950
accept it either because it's got to be

00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,120
on github yeah so for me the the data

00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,560
lives wherever it needs to and then the

00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,540
Jupiter notebooks that we go that go

00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:14,420
with it have to live unfortunately in

00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:15,980
that spot as well but yeah yeah well so

00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,330
I actually don't know I've never

00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,180
actually tried you might be able to

00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,200
actually link to something external it

00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,760
just depends on what your credentials

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,890
are to get into it because if you put it

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,090
on binder your credentials are there you

00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,310
know so if you're trying to log into

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,790
like a you know a Dropbox folder or or

00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:33,260
some other place that you have it hosted

00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:37,930
you have the risk of putting your your

00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,930
login information in that yeah

00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:47,439
cool thank you guys

00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,439
