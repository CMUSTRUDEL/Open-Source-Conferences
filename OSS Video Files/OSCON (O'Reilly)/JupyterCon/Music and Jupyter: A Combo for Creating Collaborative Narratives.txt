Title: Music and Jupyter: A Combo for Creating Collaborative Narratives
Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Music engages and delights. Carol Willing (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) explains how to explore and teach the basics of interactive computing and data science by combining music with Jupyter notebooks, using music21, a tool for computer-aided musicology, and Magenta, a TensorFlow project for making music with machine learning, to create collaborative narratives and publishing materials for teaching and learning.

	00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:07,750
we're gonna sort of do a little teaser

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:14,410
sort of overview today of how we can use

00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:17,739
Jupiter with music to actually mix and

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,369
remix content that would be useful for

00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:25,029
teaching and engage users and students

00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:28,630
and learners of all ages and although

00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:30,130
these concepts are using music as a

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,800
background

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,160
it actually would apply to really any

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,130
subject so my hope is that when you

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,950
leave here today that you will have a

00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,310
better understanding of what the realm

00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,250
of and range of things Jupiter can do to

00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,740
help your teaching improve whether

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,460
you're a teacher of students in an

00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,610
educational setting or a research group

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,399
it should help you and be useful so on

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:03,220
behalf of the entire Jupiter team I want

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,439
to thank you for using Jupiter being

00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,260
interested in Jupiter we put a lot of

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,080
time and effort into what we do and I

00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:14,080
think we really love what we do as well

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,120
my passion is education and I know

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,640
there's some other Jupiter team members

00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,330
in the room that also have the similar

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:27,700
passions and it's great to see them here

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:31,810
I also wanted to say hello on behalf of

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:35,500
fab lab San Diego and fab lab San Diego

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,049
is a community makerspace Fab Lab as a

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,979
concept started at MIT at the center of

00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:45,670
bits and atoms and San Diego is one of

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:47,890
the oldest ones outside of Boston and

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,070
right now there are fab labs throughout

00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:53,979
the world and one of the things that we

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:57,939
do as a non-profit community makerspace

00:01:53,979 --> 00:02:01,479
is we help provide a place for people

00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:03,369
from all different walks of life in San

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,820
Diego all different communities all

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:09,310
different backgrounds to gather and have

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,120
a place where they can fabricate their

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:15,189
ideas and their dreams and it makes for

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,409
some really interesting

00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:22,260
learning as somebody who likes to teach

00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,310
what resonates with different people and

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,430
this is going to be a little bit about

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,819
the story that I had with ipython

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,469
notebooks which is now Jupiter and

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,290
hopefully that will resonate with some

00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:37,719
of you as well I think Steven did a

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,150
really great job with the introduction I

00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,150
am a research engineer on project

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:46,209
Jupiter and I'm a recent director of the

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,669
Python Software Foundation I'm one of

00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:52,090
the two women that are core developers

00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:55,389
on the Pythons software language and I

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,290
in my spare time I volunteer as a geek

00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:02,500
in residence at fab lab San Diego and

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:05,430
the other Python outreach groups so

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,560
let's take a look at learning and

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,260
Herbert Simon was one of the founders of

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,169
cognitive science a Nobel laureate and a

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,569
professor at Carnegie Mellon and he did

00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:20,019
a lot of extensive research on how

00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:22,199
people learn and one of the famous

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:26,310
quotes that he had was learning results

00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:30,370
from what a student does and thinks and

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,879
only what the student does and things so

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,150
as instructors we can guide we can

00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:41,139
inspire we can motivate but we can't do

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,479
it for the students and from his work

00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,250
there are a number of other professors

00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:50,019
at Carnegie Mellon that have written an

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,780
excellent book about learning and the

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,859
title is how learning works seven reache

00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:00,430
or seven research-based principles and a

00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:04,509
few of those principles are the prior

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,909
learning that students come with can

00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:10,419
either help or hinder their future

00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:13,000
learning student how students organize

00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:16,870
their knowledge influences how they

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,120
learn so I may learn differently than

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,979
Jess or M or others in this room also

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,740
students motivation is directly related

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:29,010
to what they learn and that's not

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,010
surprising

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,850
what we're seeing is why music well

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,520
music has the ability to resonate with

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,080
many different people you don't really

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,110
need special skills to enjoy music or

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,170
even kind of make music from you know

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:54,190
early early childhood people can clap

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:57,900
kind of you know bang things and you

00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,240
know over time what we're seeing is a

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,420
change in the a piece computer science

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:09,340
curriculum to have more real-world

00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:12,970
connections to computer science and as a

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,250
learner much like dem Baba said in his

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,520
keynote this morning I want to learn

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:23,520
what resonates with me I want to create

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:26,230
classes or curriculum that not only

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,150
inspire others but would have been the

00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:33,970
class that I would have liked to take in

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:36,250
when I was younger and the research does

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,090
show that real world interests matters

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,350
and this is some very very recent data

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:46,120
probably just a couple days old at this

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:48,490
point about the impact that the new

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:54,690
computer science AP curriculum has had

00:05:48,490 --> 00:06:01,240
on girls and it is girls have gravitated

00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:03,280
to these classes now in a rate that this

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,070
past year was equivalent to all the

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,430
years prior so it's pretty impressive

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:11,710
and you know I believe the research will

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,690
also support the same happening in

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,230
people from other underrepresented

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,480
groups so I think the prior knowledge

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,030
that students come in with and their

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:27,130
motivation when you add in real-world

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:32,490
components becomes very powerful so back

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:37,240
in 2013 when I was inspired by Luciano

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,160
who teaches Python in Brazil and also is

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,590
a writer and very active in the Python

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,190
community I said ok I'm going to learn a

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,730
little

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:49,420
more Python and when I learn a new

00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:51,880
language or a new concept I try and seek

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,800
out a project that matches my interests

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,840
whether its nature or art or music and

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,610
so I stumbled across I started googling

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,090
okay what are some of music projects in

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:08,220
Python and came across Mike cut Bert's

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:12,400
music 21 project which is a musicology

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:16,510
music theory library and Python and at

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,530
the time he was doing his documentation

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:23,200
and also providing on his website some

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:27,190
snippets using the notebooks at the time

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,790
I Python notebooks and one of the ways

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:34,030
that he was pitching his library was in

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:39,870
five lines of code or less you can do

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:43,720
meaningful tasks in music research and I

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:46,750
was fascinated a by the content but even

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:51,900
more so by the notebooks themselves and

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:54,550
how quickly I could be productive and

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,390
you know I could pull down all of Bach's

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,140
corpus of music analyze how it related

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,110
to each other

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,780
I could display a sheet music I could

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,630
analyze whether two pieces were the same

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,300
or it came from a similar background or

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,820
not and that inspired me to start

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,090
playing around with it at Fab Lab in San

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,930
Diego and what I found were as people

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:23,890
that had told me adults or younger

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:26,200
people that they could never be computer

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,360
programmers they didn't understand it it

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,570
was too confusing

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,700
they innately got it by seeing it in a

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,580
notebook the fact that they could hit

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,000
shift enter and execute a cell and have

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:43,330
cool things happen that they understood

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,930
was really powerful and that motivated

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:49,540
them to want to learn more or to find a

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,910
different library that maybe you know

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,600
had to do with games games are always

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,700
popular or you know

00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,510
something that would flash like lights

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,780
on a or do we know or something but the

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,930
note books seem to have a way to engage

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:11,250
in empower users in a way that I hadn't

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:17,270
seen before and so I kind of took that

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,270
experience shared at PyCon in 2014 how

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:24,810
music engages and students and musicians

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,930
and you know it had some examples from

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,570
around the world and but I showed that

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,030
because it's something that has stuck

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,480
with me and this was before I actually

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:41,010
worked on the Jupiter team and the fact

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,560
that music was universal that there was

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,200
this cross-cultural understanding of

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,990
music we didn't have to speak the same

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,840
language we could appreciate you know

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,300
the sounds and what we were hearing it

00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,980
appreciate it also was appreciated by

00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,920
people on a wide variety of Ages so it

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,200
kind of was in some ways like an

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,090
equaliser everybody kind of started at

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,470
the same place everybody had the same

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:14,910
ability it also music is a very creative

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:18,270
personal pursuit so there is no one

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,000
right way to do music and I think

00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,370
sometimes in computer science we forget

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,080
that you know we're taught ok this is

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,680
the tutorial these are the examples this

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:32,610
is how you do it but in reality there

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:36,090
are many ways to develop software and to

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,220
write good programs there is no one

00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:44,520
right way there may be a better or worse

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:48,000
way but there's no one way also what

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,150
we're finding is that to be successful

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,600
in life to be successful in business to

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,580
be a productive member of society

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,730
lifelong learning is important the world

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,010
is changing at an even more rapid pace

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,470
now that we have all these connections

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,900
to different technologies and

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,040
information at our fingertips that quite

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,120
frankly I did not

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,940
when I was younger but you know it shows

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,000
that you're going to go through cycles

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,730
even within just a computer science like

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,670
you learn a language or a beginner you

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,560
kind of build skills and then you kind

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,940
of share those skills and become a coach

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,950
but that happens many times over and I

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:37,310
think one of the things about the

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:41,520
Jupiter notebooks are that it lets you

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:46,790
kind of lay out that beginner learner

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:49,320
and coach all in the same document and

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:52,260
you can share it with other people you

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,260
can collaborate with other people it

00:11:52,260 --> 00:12:00,270
also provides access and opportunities

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:03,210
for other people because a just from the

00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:06,390
open source nature of these notebooks

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:09,350
and the technology I can go around the

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:14,580
world to the Philippines to Taiwan to

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:17,730
Poland to Nigeria everybody's developing

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,710
notebooks and using those notebooks in

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,720
different ways and that's pretty

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,060
powerful because you start thinking

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,480
about the problems in the world that

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:31,230
require either cross disciplines to

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:37,170
solve them or even cross-cultural impact

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:40,410
to solve it and one of my favorite

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,960
quotes and people Benjamin Zander is a

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,100
conductor of the Boston Philharmonic and

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:49,080
a teacher at the New England

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,570
Conservatory and he has some great TED

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,000
talks about inspiring people and about

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:58,350
learning and one of the things he

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,840
encourages his students is to see

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,360
mistakes not as negative events to be

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,490
avoided at all costs but rather as

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,470
interesting opportunities to learn and

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,090
often with impostor syndrome and other

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,600
things we're always worried about making

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,730
a mistake

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,890
but sometimes some of the best stuff we

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,630
do comes out of the mistakes we make and

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,060
to have somebody early in your life

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,610
say it's okay to make a mistake is a

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,830
really valuable thing and I think the

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,390
notebook sort of reinforces that how

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,150
many times do you put something in a

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:37,020
cell run it and it's like okay it didn't

00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:39,480
work well I'll just delete the cell you

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:44,040
know you're not taking a huge risk when

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:49,680
you're running oneself and I think that

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:53,250
also empowers innovation because that

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,470
trial and error you can try many

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,750
different things and innovate and

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:02,180
iterate on them and you know that

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:05,400
collaboration aspect as well as the

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,500
trial and error is really important so

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,020
I'm going to switch gears a little bit

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,260
and talk a little bit about some of the

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:17,700
tools that can be used to create a

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,920
learning narrative for others and I

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,690
think everybody is sort of familiar with

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:30,120
the notebook and Jupiter lab it's soon

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:33,120
to be the the newer notebook type

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,090
environment to work in which is actually

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,650
really cool and I was a little skeptical

00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:40,770
because one of the things I liked about

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:44,190
the notebook was its simplicity and I

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:47,520
didn't want that to go away when we went

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:50,430
to Jupiter lab and I have to say I've

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,220
been proven wrong which is good a really

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,050
good thing and there are some really

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,570
nice things about Jupiter loud that

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,500
enhances learning and also Jupiter lab

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:06,000
has taken into account providing a way

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:09,780
to give that very simple clean classic

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,300
notebook feel as well markdown which is

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,450
a text markup language is something that

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,440
we would use different languages whether

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,910
it's Python our julia or any other

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,080
language kernel that we support those

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:28,830
can all be used in teaching curriculum

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,440
widgets let you control and give people

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,620
the ability to try things manipulate

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,740
things and be convert let's

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:43,290
you convert the notebooks that you have

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:45,240
into other formats such as HTML that can

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,370
then be displayed on websites and

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,920
incorporate it into different projects

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,260
which is really powerful there's also

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,590
some really nice presentation tools that

00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:00,950
notebooks are supported on like rise and

00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:04,560
enbe present Sphinx is a documentation

00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,360
builder in the Python world and one of

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,010
the really nice things about it is you

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,920
can use markdown notebooks or a more

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,200
Python a markup language restructured

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,970
text and that gives you a lot of

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,100
flexibility and it allows you to host

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,610
your documentation so that anybody can

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,480
see it

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,070
and then Jupiter hub which dem Baba

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,980
talked about this morning that he's

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,860
using it with his class at Harvard and

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,750
just as used it as sort of the pioneer

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,520
at Berkeley that then has grown and

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,870
grown and grown

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,090
you know Jupiter hub and binder let you

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,620
have people give people access to those

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,680
notebooks without having to install

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,990
anything and for a beginner or a new

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:54,330
user going to a website is much easier

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:55,950
than installing so I'm pretty sure

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,780
everybody is familiar with the notebooks

00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,980
but you know it does give you a great

00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,870
environment where you can have

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,950
visualizations where you can run code

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:08,070
where you can have pros and I think the

00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:10,800
key elements of that is it lets you have

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:12,810
an interactive experience it lets you

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,810
explore across a number of different

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,110
disciplines and for the sciences in

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,480
particular it lets you have a

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,820
reproducible environment which is very

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,120
important particularly for young

00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:30,780
scientists even elementary school age to

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:36,180
realize that the results that they're

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:38,640
getting can be replicated and I think

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,830
the reproducibility also benefits

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,020
collaboration and Sciences across

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,600
different scientific disciplines if

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,340
you're a chemist or a biologist if

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,190
you're collaborating

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,410
it gives you a way to understand where

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,000
their results have come from even if you

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:58,680
don't have a depth in their knowledge

00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,500
space so some of the content that we

00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,460
would remix for say if we were doing

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,080
some music curriculum music lessons

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:12,290
would be the music 21 music theory

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:17,010
library magenta which is tensor flows

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:19,230
music creation and art creation library

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,090
which is relatively new but actually

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,060
really cool

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,430
alan downey who's done some great work

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:29,610
on teaching he's a professor at Olin

00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:32,610
College and he's got a new book called

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:36,930
think DSP which is digital signal

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:39,180
processing and I wish that book had been

00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:42,150
around when I was doing my Electrical

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:45,300
Engineering learning way back in the 80s

00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:48,660
because how cool would it have been to

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:53,370
be able to execute formulas see what

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:56,190
happened manipulate it and create havoc

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:59,610
if you will with with sounds which would

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:02,460
be really cool extemporary is a live

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:05,460
coding environment for music much like

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,210
sonic piya's which is often used with

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,260
kids and then visualizing music and

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:16,920
Murray Thomas is a professor at the

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:19,560
University of st. Thomas and in Saint

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:23,160
Paul Minnesota and she's also written a

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,220
book about making makers and how people

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,710
in their childhood learn how to be

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,690
creative and learn how to create things

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:36,630
and she's doing some phenomenal work

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:39,600
with VR and AR and also having her

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,970
students do real-world hands-on projects

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,150
and really making an impact in their

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:48,330
community some of the Jupiter specific

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:53,430
ingredients again just to recap you can

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:56,090
use pros code visualizations you can put

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,370
video and animations in the notebooks

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,450
you can use widgets to control content

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,260
in the notebook

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:09,000
and you can also use audio sorry about

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:12,990
that so looking at pros for those of you

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,500
that are new to markdown which many of

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,230
us are when we first start it's very

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,320
similar to just typing into a text

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,990
editor word Google Docs whatever your

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,640
favorite is and there's really probably

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:33,210
four commands or four markup elements

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,280
that are useful one is headings and the

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,370
other is how do you italicize something

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,550
you just put asterisks on either side

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,470
double asterisks bold things and the

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:47,100
back ticks on either side will let you

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,960
render things in a code font and then

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,080
for those of you that might be new for

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,230
the notebooks shift-enter execute the

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,090
cells and when you're teaching it's

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,600
sometimes a good thing to share that

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,160
with students because otherwise they're

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,470
like clicking around and the cells not

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,960
executing and if they don't press the

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:10,200
little arrow and I've found in teaching

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,380
that you know sometimes that little tip

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,660
at the start is really important just to

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,690
break down the barriers so one of the

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,540
nice things about Jupiter lab is you

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,560
have the ability to do a live preview so

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:29,400
in one window you could have your markup

00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,710
markdown source code and then have a

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,640
live preview in a window next to it

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:37,860
which we didn't have with the classic

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,710
notebook and I think for writing

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,830
documentation or writing curriculum it

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:46,560
is really handy to be able to have that

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:50,250
multi window environment and to see the

00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:56,070
rendered version next to the source

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:57,690
version running code I think many of you

00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,380
are familiar with that

00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,360
Jupiter lab also lets you attach a

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,240
console so that you can have your

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,660
notebook in one window and I have sort

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,600
of like a scratch paper console in

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,960
another window and you can execute a

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,299
code cell

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,059
and then bring that code into your

00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:22,149
scratch pad window play around with that

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:24,309
code as much as you want and then it

00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:26,639
doesn't impact what's happening in your

00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:29,830
actual notebook so if you're doing heavy

00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:31,210
prototyping or you're trying to learn a

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,759
concept and you're trying lots of

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:37,119
different things it gives you a record

00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:40,389
of what you've done without changing the

00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:43,779
notebook itself and you can do things

00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:49,059
like pip install stuff by dropping into

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:51,669
a bash shell or you can once you're done

00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:55,450
prototyping export it as a Python script

00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:58,779
or so that you could use it in a

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:03,549
different way running code in the

00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:07,690
notebook again shift-enter shift command

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:11,909
enter in jupiter lab will let you have

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:14,559
that classic notebook look and feel and

00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:18,090
it is actually very nice that's actually

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:22,690
the single user version right there

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:27,549
so as far as visualizations go this is

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:32,440
an example of music 21 and its ability

00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:34,480
to render sheet music so this Jeff kind

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,830
of shows okay if I go through and I hit

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,619
click enter on this one line of code it

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:45,190
will bring up sheet music based on

00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:47,440
whatever I have passed to it and to have

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,779
that happen instantaneously whether it's

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,429
with music or another subject I think is

00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:56,580
very powerful because you get that

00:23:51,429 --> 00:24:02,610
instant feedback so that's pretty nice

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:06,639
in addition you can also have music 21

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:09,669
interact with a third party program

00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:15,220
called musescore and musescore actually

00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:20,679
will let you display the sheet music it

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:22,899
will allow you to track the different

00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,580
points in the music like the tempo it'll

00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:26,920
play music so you could play along with

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:31,060
it it would actually play it if I

00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:33,370
sound turned up right now on it but I

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,830
think it's something that it kind of

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,430
opens the doors to the possibilities

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:44,860
that you can go beyond the notebook and

00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:47,070
use the notebook as your guide in

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,800
addition we talked about assess

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:54,490
accessibility earlier and music21 had a

00:24:50,800 --> 00:25:00,240
really cool feature that it lets you

00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:05,200
translate music to Braille so that same

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:08,560
passage that we had at the last slide

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,710
that was sheet music actually was in

00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:16,840
Braille at the bottom of executing this

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:19,300
notebook so it opens the doors to you

00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,450
know people that might not be able to

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,280
experience a notebook and you know I'm

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,100
sure the similar concepts could be used

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,820
to translate notebook content as well

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:34,390
although I haven't seen that yet in

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:40,300
addition with notebooks you can also

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:43,810
drop in YouTube videos and animations

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:47,310
and before I talked about anne-marie

00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:50,320
Thomas and the work that she was doing

00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:52,600
so you can actually run like YouTube

00:25:50,320 --> 00:26:00,550
snippets you can use the queuing up of

00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:02,560
YouTube as well to kind of box or you

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,480
know keep a section of the video as

00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,620
opposed to the whole thing so I've often

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,360
used it to teach workshops like one of

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,670
the workshops we did in San Diego was an

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,820
intro to Python we use Jessica's

00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:20,050
McCullers very popular intro to Python

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,990
Boston Python workshop that's been

00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:25,300
online for a long time and we converted

00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,730
that into notebooks that then you could

00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:31,000
you know watch part of the snippet do

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,800
the exercise and we found it was really

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,480
nice when people came through the intro

00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,180
to Python workshops in San Diego they

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,100
can leave with notebooks and it sort of

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,690
made it less stressful to learn

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,159
something

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,590
you widgets I'm not going to demonstrate

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,070
for a lack of a little bit of bandwidth

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:53,850
here but I encourage you later to check

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,740
out these websites but essentially on

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,840
the Jupiter website there are some

00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,980
different examples of widgets one of

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,850
which is IP volume and that cube when

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,360
you run it

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,570
the red dots will kind of like cycle

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,000
through the space and you can

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:15,740
three-dimensionally rotate and flip and

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,039
whatever the the cube that's there and

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,919
in addition if you have one of those

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,990
virtual reality goggles type things you

00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,259
can click on a button that says stereo

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:30,149
and you can actually see it in a

00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:34,710
multi-dimensional space which is kind of

00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:41,090
cool so tensorflow

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:46,649
is Google brains research project for

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:51,960
creating music and art and it's just

00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:54,000
fascinating it I have to confess my

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,879
daughter was the one that found it for

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,980
me about a year ago she's like hey mom I

00:27:56,879 --> 00:28:02,789
found this really cool Python library

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,429
she's 22 now living in Japan and she's

00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:08,730
like it can create these colorings of

00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:12,029
this anime stuff for manga pictures I

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:14,009
was like okay this is really cool now my

00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:15,600
daughter is a self-taught programmer she

00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:17,009
did take programming high school and

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,740
then decided since she was the only girl

00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:25,019
that was it and she's very much more

00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,179
into language and linguistics but I was

00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:31,169
like oh that's cool so she was the one

00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,789
that showed me magenta and you know the

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:36,000
fact that she stumbled across tin and

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:39,000
thought it was cool other people will

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,460
think it's cool there are a whole bunch

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,870
of demos that are in notebooks in

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:48,299
magenta for both music and art and I

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:50,129
would encourage you to take those but

00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:54,240
how it relates to music is some of these

00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:57,190
music notebooks you can

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,240
manipulate that content and make the

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,970
notebooks and this whole new technology

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,980
accessible to high school students

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:10,960
college students anybody really and

00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,340
we'll see if the sound will pick up on

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:19,020
this

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:24,790
there actually are can you hear that

00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:28,750
that is actually music generated by the

00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:31,290
machine learning algorithms I'm gonna

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,810
just make that a little quieter but

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:36,760
after series of learning it will take

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:40,870
like the first few notes that you give

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,480
it and then the program will actually

00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,520
generate the remaining music content

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,630
that you're hearing so you may be like

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,660
the first eight or ten notes was stuff

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,810
that had been provided to the system but

00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:59,950
then the rest of the music including

00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:04,750
like you know emphasis and and you know

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:07,150
the dynamics were generated by the

00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:10,530
program which is I think really neat

00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:13,360
because it actually sounds pretty good

00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:16,060
they have some other examples about how

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,110
you can create your own instrument by

00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,760
combining other instruments one of the

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,920
things that I think is really cool they

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,130
have a learning component on their

00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:32,650
website and one of them takes everyday

00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:36,420
sounds and they recorded tons and tons

00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:39,730
of sounds and ran it through magenta and

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,890
tensorflow and they made this infinite

00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:47,910
drum machine so you can actually go to

00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:52,150
this website and see how different

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:55,800
sounds are sort of classified in similar

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:58,570
regions you can mix and remix them and

00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,720
you also get the research papers behind

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,450
it so not only is it fun and cool and

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,400
engaging but there's actually academic

00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,330
merit behind it

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,910
if that was something you chose to do

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:16,690
similarly they have another example of

00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:20,890
categorizing bird sounds and sort of

00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:23,230
taking a page from nature and you know

00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:28,210
things like that connect the real world

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:31,690
very quickly to the data science or

00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:34,720
scientific world so I have these links

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,730
the slide deck is up online already on

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,680
speaker deck and SlideShare so I

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,290
encourage you to try them out because

00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,820
they are actually very engaging and if

00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:49,090
you can bring down all the Wi-Fi more

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:52,600
better to you and you know all I can say

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:56,590
is this photo kind of sums up for me

00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,920
it's like that Wow moment of we can do

00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:04,180
cool stuff we can engage people and we

00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:06,460
can learn from it so how do we do that I

00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,350
think like many things you start with

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,410
the content and the content can be

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:14,770
videos code notebooks you know start

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:17,530
gathering your content and gather it

00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:21,090
into a repo Dropbox whatever kind of

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:24,390
works for you and from that content

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:30,120
start creating and iterating on

00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:34,270
notebooks for your students for other

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,400
classrooms and the students can iterate

00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,230
on those notebooks as well and kind of

00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,840
you get this like feedback loop which is

00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,140
really kind of cool you can use the

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,740
binder project to share the notebooks

00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:50,500
with other people and other classmates

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,410
so if you had a peer across the world

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:57,100
they could just click a button in binder

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,620
and execute the notebooks and see what

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,860
you're seeing

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:07,020
again you could run workshops you could

00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:11,920
publish either textbooks or

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:16,530
documentation tutorials using Sphinx as

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,530
well as other website

00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,450
this is an example of binder we've

00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,780
reacted binder over the last few months

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,790
and made it much quicker and we're

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,570
stable so you're gonna be hearing more

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:38,010
about that in the next month or so from

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:41,860
the Jupiter project a couple examples of

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:43,330
learning efforts that I've seen that

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,920
have been particularly good demo ba

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,660
talked a little bit about his this

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,480
morning

00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:53,530
for those of you that use our and are

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:58,300
looking for a more formalized way to

00:33:53,530 --> 00:34:00,640
teach our and other content Tonia

00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,300
Schlosser has actually done some really

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:08,560
great work in that community making that

00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:15,730
content accessible and interactive much

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:18,760
like okay so what can you or your

00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:22,780
students do with Jupiter well you can

00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,230
extend existing content you can apply

00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:29,020
content from different problem spaces

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:35,500
you can collaborate amongst students or

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:38,530
instructors much like a DJ you can mix

00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:42,429
and remix music you can Rick mix and

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:45,100
remix notebooks and there's probably a

00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:47,260
whole bunch of other stuff that we

00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,600
haven't even heard of yet that we can do

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,159
that one of our students or another

00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,320
instructor is going to figure out how to

00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:59,650
do and hopefully share back with all of

00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:03,580
us so in closing I think Jupiter

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:07,890
notebooks and music provide an easy

00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:10,330
on-ramp and a gateway for learning and

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:15,100
these are some of the ways we've used it

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:18,190
in the Python community and really the

00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:21,040
future is for you to create and your

00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,840
students to create and I encourage you

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,000
to go out and take some of these

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:31,320
concepts apply it to your work

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,660
and on behalf of Jupiter and Fablab San

00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,180
Diego I thank you for being a lovely

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,700
audience I hope I have inspired you to

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,160
take even a little snippet of this or

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:52,170
just go play with the toys because it's

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:53,010
really cool so thank you do we have time

00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,190
for questions

00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:59,400
I think so do we yeah I'll let you be

00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:02,670
the yeah we have a few minutes okay I'll

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,940
let you be the ubii then saw that hand

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,940
first

00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,820
I do and one of the things that I was

00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,640
hoping to get done before this talk is I

00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,040
wanted to collate all the stuff that I

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,770
had and then I started realizing I had

00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,410
enough to do a three-hour tutorial so I

00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:29,420
would be happy to provide links to some

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:32,810
of the stuff that I did early on as well

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,720
as the links to the ipython notebooks

00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,920
that we used a long time ago for

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,609
teaching Python just to give you an

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:44,060
example and then also the the folks that

00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:47,359
I referenced in the presentation dem

00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:49,820
Baba and particularly tanya their

00:36:47,359 --> 00:37:00,500
resources are all available online and

00:36:49,820 --> 00:37:03,160
are quite good thank you he made a cameo

00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,160
in the talk

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,710
right

00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:28,670
yeah well I guess I can share a couple

00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:33,540
examples from the Fablab in San Diego

00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:36,420
one of the groups of folks that we have

00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:39,570
that come during the day are some

00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,610
students that are home-schooled a fair

00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:47,010
number of them may have Asperger's or

00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:51,990
autism and they have made some

00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:55,110
phenomenal strides in you know graphic

00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:57,600
design and you know the ability to kind

00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,550
of get that instantaneous feedback but

00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,590
also the ability to be able to go really

00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,690
deep and detailed and something that

00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,430
resonates with them

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:09,210
I think is really important whether it's

00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:11,370
trains or you know the subjects are you

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:15,090
know is whatever you could think of but

00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:17,580
I think you know I also think with the

00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:22,260
widgets that it gives you some sort of

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:25,740
tactile sliding or manipulating of

00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,590
objects using the widgets that even

00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,540
though you're not really physically

00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:33,660
turning the cube you're kind of making

00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:36,990
it move so I do think that interactivity

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,780
is really important and helpful for a

00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:43,950
lot of learners as opposed to just the

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:48,260
wall of text so I think we could do one

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,260
more question I know that you had one

00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:54,650
so there is very little audio content

00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,450
but lots of information about algorithms

00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:00,190
of all these kind of things that could

00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,190
benefit from reusing

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
in fostering the attraction for Ashley

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:21,280
so we had suggested to use to Pacific

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,280
none of us was expert enough in using

00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:42,349
yeah well okay so a couple things one of

00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:46,619
the is Wikipedia is a great resource for

00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:48,390
content and links from notebooks for

00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:51,119
learners I mean I think people are using

00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:53,670
that already but I think to your

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,510
specific question I think some of the

00:39:53,670 --> 00:40:00,180
things like binder which highlights

00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:02,339
examples basically that provide a link

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,630
or a button that you can embed in a page

00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:09,349
that lets you kind of share and

00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:13,380
distribute in a different way than

00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:16,140
having a github repo you know if I embed

00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:20,039
in a webpage a button that then takes me

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:25,020
to an interactive binder I think that's

00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:26,579
very powerful and interesting you know I

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,099
think some of it is probably just

00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:31,349
getting the people that have an interest

00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:34,400
in all three things together at a

00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:36,960
conference and to do a small sprint and

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,569
once you've kind of got an example out

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,529
there then I think people kind of you

00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:46,109
know create more content because four

00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:48,510
years ago the use of Jupiter ipython

00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:50,609
notebooks at the time was not the same

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:54,260
that it is today and I think the more

00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:57,690
examples that you see the more adoption

00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,539
happens out there so I'd be happy to

00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:03,120
chat with you after as well

00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:06,860
well great well let's thank Carol again

00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,860
