hi I'm Paco Nathan from O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,639
and we're here at Jupiter con it's a

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,230
pleasure to get to speak with Peter Wang

00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,019
co-founder and CTO for continuum

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,910
analytics and I really enjoyed your

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,949
keynote today thank you super

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,029
inspirational for us thank you

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,990
you know the themes of communities and

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,460
definitely when you have an open source

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,130
project what does it take beyond just

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,510
having that code mitad there what what

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,650
about the people in the interactions

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,590
right speaking about Jupiter one of the

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,790
things I wanted to lead off with was

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,940
what's been the most unexpected thing

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,550
for you in terms of how Jupiter's

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,020
popularity how its rolled out well I

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,079
think one of the things that's really

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:52,199
interesting is how watching people the

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,980
sense of empowerment that when they

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,690
realize they can make things in the web

00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,480
and I know you're like you know a

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,300
longtime Internet technology enthusiast

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,739
so let's say and and and you know we've

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,420
always thought of the Internet and the

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,540
web as being this incredibly democratic

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,990
medium but in last you know maybe 15

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,520
years or so

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,650
eternal September was you know a while

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,030
ago but it's really turning to more of a

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,409
broadcast medium right before used to

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,170
consuming things especially now more

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,750
with smartphones and so people sort of

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,250
you forget what you give up when all you

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,950
do is consume media consume consume

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,560
consume and what I've seen with Jupiter

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,290
is that people once it can get that

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,720
feeling of Oh making something in the

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,659
browser is something I can do and and

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,210
I've been a geologist I being a social

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,130
scientist right I being anybody I can

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,689
actually not only can i play with my

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,240
data which is awesome right that's

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,649
awesome but I'm actually creating a

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,390
thing I'm creating an artifact I'm

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,909
creating a thing that I can share with

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,850
other people and that very human act of

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,320
creation and then of sharing is

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,850
something that we always you know we've

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,469
known the the internet was supposed to

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,540
do this right it was just a bliss and

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,790
and yet it's been slowly taken away from

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,320
us just removed from the expectation and

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,700
I think one of the really cool things

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,890
and probably one of the most promising

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,720
things about Jupiter is that it restores

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:15,690
that the Democratic aspect of creation

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,190
in the online medium and so for me if

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,480
that unex that was that's probably one

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,340
the most unexpected things because I

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,780
feel I can write websites is not

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,570
unexpected to me to be able to write a

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,760
website but it's unexpected to see how

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,470
empowering is for people who are not web

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,380
developers right to be able to go and

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:35,340
build something interactive and neat

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,330
online talking about open-source one of

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,840
the things that really struck me from

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,030
the keynote was just how crucial some of

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,330
these projects are very core of

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,800
infrastructure you gave an example about

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,970
email and and spam and also security

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,720
we're talking about open SSL and

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,670
heartbleed in your opinion you know one

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,160
of things that came to mind there was in

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,370
your opinion is is there a kind of

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,470
overhang of liability for public

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,110
infrastructure that depends on crucial

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,270
resources in open source for those

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,420
projects to be supported more formally

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,459
is there an overhang of liability yeah

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,790
so some well like a case in point would

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:20,519
be with with OpenSSH uh-huh a lot of

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,130
people depend on that right so do we

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,140
need to do more of a perspective of how

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,570
much we're depending on open source and

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,920
really commit more public funding to it

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:35,190
or more I'm price finding to it yeah so

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,130
maybe the the way to put it my thought

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,620
on it is that the software does this

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,739
really weird thing that's counter to

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,320
ative to us which is that it really

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,299
hasn't it the the relationship of

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,150
capital expenditure versus operational

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,459
expenditure are really different your

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,260
software okay most things that people

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,510
have an intuition about in physical life

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,120
let's say if you want to build a house

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,709
if you want to go and build a ship if

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,350
you want to do whatever there's an

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,380
effort that we understand must be

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,670
undertaken right and that effort is you

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,200
know what we call capital expenditure

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,030
right you have to go and draw up the

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,570
plans get the concrete pour the

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,310
foundation build all this stuff wire it

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,130
but with software that capital

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,770
expenditure usually is it's it's

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,200
actually the concentrated effort of a

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,700
relatively small number of people

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,920
and most of the software longtail kind

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,210
of cost is the maintenance cost and

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,280
that's sort of the operational

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,390
expenditure right but most of the

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,710
operational expenditure you get with

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,230
software because software doesn't really

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,390
erode so to speak it sort of falls out

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,070
of sync with the world around it with a

00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,050
digital world around it but it doesn't

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,990
really like you can still go and play

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,850
minesweeper and solitaire babies you can

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,520
still go and run DOS games right they

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,340
never stopped working right you just

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,790
can't like Instagram your like screen

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,140
capture from King's Quest right but but

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,100
the real world's not like that right if

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,630
you don't maintain a building a

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,460
hurricane is going to blow it down right

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,050
or some electrical short because of a

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,510
mouse it's gonna burn the thing down and

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,630
so with software almost all operational

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:15,210
expenditure is insurance its technical

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,100
issuance it's risk mitigation and it's

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,740
the idea that if we pay the maintenance

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,730
now it's cheaper than when it does fall

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,410
over later so in terms of liability then

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,720
or the kind of the debt so is that the

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,440
overhang right yeah the debt is simply

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,820
just pending insurance premiums right

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,250
and if you'd never pay the insurance

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,800
down at some point when the stuff goes

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,540
down when it goes south well you just go

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,360
and pay the capital expenditure to

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,730
rebuild again right and so I think it's

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,740
a very different kind of thing than like

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,880
the upkeep for software is not actually

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,120
upkeep because the software just stays

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,320
up it's really making it keeping the

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,390
ground clear so when you do have to

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,670
rebuild it's cheaper to rebuild so it's

00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,440
a different this is a really weird geeky

00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,880
economic sorry I guess but this is a

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,220
great but that's kind of how I think

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,690
about it is like and and actually this

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,770
would like I wish they taught this I

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,990
wish they would teach this in every

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,030
single CS course right because you have

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,910
to understand software's power is that

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,550
the distribution cost goes to zero the

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,720
reproduction cost goes to zero it

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,130
doesn't have to be maintained because

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,410
once the bits are organized they're

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,760
organized right and entropy is actually

00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,870
relative to all the environment around

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,490
it and so with that in mind the way you

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,720
have to manage software is different

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,300
than the way you think about the cost of

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,710
managing software is different so but to

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,710
the broader point of your question I

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,840
think that the world at large does need

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,639
to become more cognizant of how much it

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,750
depends on these are

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,129
source efforts from just a few

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,389
contributors and and I'm not sure again

00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,610
I guess as a question for the for the

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,469
community right how best to go about

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,169
that we I don't have any cute answers

00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:54,689
they unfortunately this is great getting

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:58,560
the most important matters up front huh

00:06:54,689 --> 00:07:01,560
so that people can can join in hmm you

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,449
know it opens the door also for yeah as

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,069
a computer science major you should

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,990
probably have insurance people talking

00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,310
with you or maybe insurance company

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,810
should be taking a look at how they can

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,279
help out with popular open-source

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,529
projects because that does seem to fit

00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,539
more than model yeah I think that it you

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:18,599
could you could actually go through the

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,520
problem is that I think the mechanism

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,289
for insurance also then has a tie-in to

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,120
liability so because companies I don't

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,539
think it's quite so obvious how

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,340
companies get held liable for faults and

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,349
failures and software see I mean even a

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,569
cyber security right right when some

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,789
company cuz they give something up they

00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,839
leak a hundred million records of you

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:45,719
know private user data I feel like

00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:49,349
people don't take the insurance aspect

00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:52,259
of it seriously enough because the costs

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:54,900
of having these goofs is so small yet

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,810
right once those lawsuits if there ever

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,370
is some serious punitive stuff coming

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,779
this way then they're gonna want to buy

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,430
insurance once I want to buy insurance

00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,440
and the insurers are gonna want to

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,819
actually come and assess what is your

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,500
compliance like not just compliance

00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,699
paperwork wise there's already an

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,650
infinite amount of compliance paperwork

00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,050
for any kind of company sure but like

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,210
actually evaluating risk like at an

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,740
actuarial level I what version of what

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,539
software what packages what libraries

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,020
right now very few companies even think

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,699
about this and and ours is one of the

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,800
ones that can actually do some actual

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,689
technical assessment I'm on the

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,659
open-source data science kind of pieces

00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:32,579
and even then it's not perfect so what I

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:34,199
can imagine you have a excellent vantage

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,570
point of real bird's-eye view exactly

00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:38,279
where those dependencies are and what

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,750
some of the interactions would be

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,209
because of what you're seeing at scale

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,339
yeah we sort of have a lot of

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,920
interesting ideas for how to tell

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,110
businesses for them it's not not about

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,540
loss aversion like oh my data got me up

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,140
reached or this model stopped working

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,600
but it's

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,030
more about helping them understand the

00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,270
cost of future change so let's say you

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,890
are CTO for some big you know insurance

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,870
company we're in New York so some big

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,430
hedge fund or something you got a pile

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,050
data scientist they built some models

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,130
and they work or they build some stuff

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,740
you know this is really good let's put

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,270
in production as a CTO or someone who

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,340
manages all this you want to understand

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,900
what is my likely cost of maintenance

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,700
for this to keep it relevant and

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,320
accurate moving forward and if you have

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,570
no visibility into the health of the

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,560
projects you're using you have no

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,700
possible way of answering that question

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,710
you're sort of like well I'm gonna

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,130
maintain my staffing levels here and

00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,300
just pray right yeah that's the best I

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,450
can do that's the best anyone can do

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,580
what we're hoping to do is actually work

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,350
with the community and also do some

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,840
legwork on our own to actually start

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,670
giving people an ability to have

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,750
visibility into you know what most of

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,160
your models that you've gotten to

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,890
production they're using these very

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,090
well-maintained healthy projects but you

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,250
got a couple that are you relying on

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,960
some like old stuff so you might want to

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,400
think about at some point either

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,480
rewriting those things or building a

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,430
different dependency in or something

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,870
right that kind of like actual software

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:04,950
you know having that visibility into

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,480
your upstream risk is not something that

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,210
I don't think anyone really offers that

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,170
no I don't know any data services and

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,940
the works for this

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,170
so yes the data service is interesting

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,840
we've thought about what would be an

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:21,180
appropriate thing to do as a to make a

00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:23,010
play kind of in the data space we are we

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,510
have not no we've not really done any

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,710
efforts there I think there's a lot of

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,930
people who are trying to do good work in

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,310
you know community data sources and

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,200
these kinds of things there's a company

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,180
in Austin called data world all right

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,390
years ago there's input chips right head

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,230
why does it be a data marketplace and so

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,820
I think those things will continue

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,360
there's large public datasets on the

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,090
various cloud vendors I do think that as

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,840
deep learning and AI evolved they're

00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:52,740
going to push they're going to basically

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,660
drive up some kind of community dynamic

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,550
where we'll have some standard data sets

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,070
in subfields of data science like

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,410
networks or GIS they're sort of like

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,120
standard data sets people know about I

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,310
think in the broader machine learning

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,640
space we're going to have a similar kind

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,870
of thing

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,790
they're gonna be well known data says if

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,350
you will start using but in terms of

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,530
actually providing commercial data

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,050
services right I actually think that's

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,820
that's an incredibly hard thing to do in

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,230
general right data connectors is

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,170
probably better yeah

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,210
now as far as Jupiter what are some

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,970
areas where continuum is using Jupiter

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,620
well so we've actually used Jupiter from

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,860
the very beginning so continuum started

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,840
2012 Jupiter notebooks were the web

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,760
notebooks were released in 2011 and then

00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,890
in the fall of 2012 we released an

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,350
actual guy cloud hosted online notebook

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,840
service called Akari and we realized

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,580
very quickly that actually as a small

00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,790
start-up we do not have the funds to

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,560
keep this like a popular web service

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,080
running like we were just paying a lot

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,510
of money to Amazon every month and so

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,280
the thing we realized is people want to

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,800
run this stuff on Prem so we built an

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,300
on-premises enterprise notebook product

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,790
and we're still selling that and that's

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,810
still very popular we've now evolved

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,570
that to be a much broader enterprise

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,890
deployment capability as well as

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,930
notebooks and all these other things in

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,960
package management so it's part of our

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,020
overall enterprise offering and we've

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:22,830
also stepped up to help on the Jupiter

00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,360
lab project and so the some of the core

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,520
group our lab developers are continuing

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,280
developers and we fold a jupiter lab

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,560
into the core of our next version of our

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,970
enterprise platform so so we absolutely

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,400
using the core many of the different

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,100
devs that continuum also contribute to

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,860
the open source Jupiter ecosystem so

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:44,220
things like some of the presentation

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,330
views and and be convert and you know

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,740
every viewer there's much different

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,780
places where our deaths of plugged in on

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,860
things so yeah we definitely have a lot

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,650
of interaction that you put a focus

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,910
excellent from that perspective then are

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,950
there there are gaps that you could

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,020
point to where people should try to

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,450
focus anything in Jupiter that you would

00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,000
say that you know like life likely

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:05,550
suspects like yeah well I think what's

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,340
gonna happen with Jupiter is that people

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:11,160
are going to start building really

00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,240
interesting application dashboard

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,300
whatever kind of things are going to

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,190
build sort of like targeted you eyes for

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,410
certain kinds of data transformation of

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,350
data analysis

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,759
and so those targeted things that's the

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,990
kind of thing that's like perfect for a

00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,860
platformer like Jupiter right because

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,360
who better to build a UI for some kind

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,949
of weather prediction or some kind of

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,540
like disease model then the actual

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,769
scientists doing the modeling right now

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,649
so that's I think it'll get taken care

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:39,899
of the hard part is just one layer down

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,750
at the infrastructure layer building

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:45,240
broader tools so building like a really

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,240
solid open-source Jupiter lab native

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,620
data wrangling tool okay that's a sort

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,069
of thing that's like incredibly hard

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,050
work it has a thousand little doodads

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:57,660
and knobs and switches and bells and

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,949
whistles and every single user thinks

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,509
their feature request is the most

00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:02,850
important right right and you're not

00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,449
building a data wrangling tool just for

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,980
genomics or just for cyber threat model

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:09,959
you're building trying to try to build

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,279
this general thing is really hard and

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,560
that's where it takes a community effort

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,939
to all rally together to say no we're

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,920
not going to each build our own slightly

00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:19,050
crappy sixty five percent good right

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,620
data wrangling think we're gonna build

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,939
one we're gonna do this one and coherent

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,310
our four like that in the open source is

00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:28,800
extremely difficult so I think those are

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:32,130
it's like things like that right maybe

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,589
some nice sequel interfaces and sequel

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,540
data visualization kind of things yeah I

00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,279
guess it's also still tied to the data

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,410
wrangling bits so those kinds of things

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,410
are I think where the ecosystem needs to

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,810
go next now one thing about Jupiter is

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,910
that it works great if your laptop has

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,100
the compute power and the memory for

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,380
what you need to run I've run into cases

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,810
lately where I don't have enough GPUs on

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,339
my my laptop therefore it for the thing

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,579
that I really want to see what enough is

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:02,189
one right well I was curious about that

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:04,230
I know that continuum is also been

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,680
working with parallelization it won

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,809
loads

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,209
does that intersect some with your work

00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:11,790
with with Jupiter to be able to make

00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:14,100
processing backends much more reasonable

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,379
yes yes so there's two aspects of that

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,889
one aspect is the parallelization of

00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,629
compute right as you say and that the

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,850
work we do there is actually kind of at

00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,040
a lower level just in the is not much to

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,139
do with Jupiter really Jupiter is a nice

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,689
environment to do it in because you have

00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,970
this nicer UI you can build right trying

00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:36,569
to offer people good usability

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:39,120
just a standard like vt100 terminal is a

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:41,370
little it's like not great so you the

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,839
stupider gives much nicer things so if

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,129
you look at desk and you look at doing

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,009
parallel jobs and - you have a nice

00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:48,029
dashboard you look at and and so I think

00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:49,949
we'll have better things like that

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,569
servicing and Jupiter

00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,879
you know the spark ecosystem already has

00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:55,709
things like Zeppelin and and whatnot

00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,310
that gives them that nicer interface to

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:02,790
their parallel compute but but the other

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:05,550
thing that we work on is helping to move

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,639
workloads from a local machine to cloud

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,800
or to server workloads and so we've

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,839
built you know the stuff we've build

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,550
around khandha packaging it's actually

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,810
it's kind of a geeky point but it's

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,149
actually like a really important to this

00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,370
right because if you use packages XY and

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,629
Z and the server or the cloud thing you

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,850
want to move to doesn't have those

00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:25,410
packages you can't move your work right

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,870
you're stuck on your uncle machine and

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,670
so with kondeh package that we provide

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,980
at least a basic infrastructure to be

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,699
able to move your work across what we've

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:38,670
done next is created actually a new

00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,709
project called oddly enough it's called

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,629
anaconda project it's the project called

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:45,089
adding on a project but it essentially

00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:47,160
is taking that conda environment concept

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:48,959
in the package encapsulation to the next

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,029
level so it's like a lightweight docker

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,860
for data science but there's no machine

00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,870
virtualization right there's no like oh

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,430
you must use this little bun to image or

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,259
anything like that it actually is native

00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,319
on all the platforms and it basically

00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,930
just lets you very easily describe your

00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,179
data science project and have that then

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,370
move from your local machine to a remote

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,150
machine or to the cloud and we we hope

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:13,860
that the Anaconda project effort coupled

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,049
with jupiter lab will really start

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:19,620
creating this portable encapsulated data

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,579
science kind of capability and so yeah

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,150
that's one of the things that we're very

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:27,419
excited about fantastic it that view of

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,010
of packaging and an encapsulation it

00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,750
strikes me that that would fit really

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,730
well with what's emerging now in terms

00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,070
of more of the kind of service

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,990
architectures yeah so I mean we've seen

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,539
this trend to have more lightweight

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,280
virtualization of hypervisor and Aleksey

00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:44,220
and docker but even going beyond that

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,260
now into more server lists so it does

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,710
seem like an ax

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,020
a project and and what's going on with

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,970
with Python would map into the world of

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,260
like cloud function and lambda in the

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,950
rest yes

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,870
so there's definitely use cases there

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,020
that dovetail very nicely into some of

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:06,470
the technology that we've built I think

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,660
it basically increases the kind the

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,490
number of work loads you can do in a

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,880
server list or present in a server list

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,370
kind of facility at the end of the day

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,500
there's no free lunch right so if the

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,000
work you're doing requires the

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,640
generation or the management of

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,790
persistent state someone's got to manage

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,780
the state right right and so what we're

00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,340
trying to do with things like kind of

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:33,650
kind of project and to some extent con

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:36,620
environments is to make the management

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,580
or just create create some structure

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,620
some interface where you can

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,450
declaratively talk about what your

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,220
dependencies look like for the runtime

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,330
what your dependencies look like from an

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,950
authentication and data access

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,800
perspective you know I have the

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,780
declarative way essentially of talking

00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,990
about what what is the necessary

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,880
conditions for your code to just run

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,610
right and then once you have that a

00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,960
declarative form a lot of infrastructure

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,940
built out that understands that

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,050
declaration and provision things for you

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,640
manages them for you

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,320
can understand reason about correctness

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,890
of the runtime because that's where

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,920
these things tend to to fall over is if

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,690
you can't provide a way for the human to

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,700
talk about what is the correct operation

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,160
of what I'm trying to do then there's no

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,020
possibility for engineers to go build

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,310
infrastructure that manages it for you

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,860
right they can just sort of fire and

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:27,350
hope and pray but they certainly cannot

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,300
build any kind of guarantees around the

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,640
service you know in terms of

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,560
dependencies to it you know people think

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,730
about package dependency what library

00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,350
what point release but it's a much

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,860
larger problem you were talking about

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,070
data

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,140
I imagine some access grants permissions

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:47,750
things like note what's kind of the the

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:51,190
breadth of that then well it it goes

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:53,360
well man it's it's Turtles it's angry

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,830
there's a great quest for get where I

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,770
saw it it must win hacker knees threat

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,640
someone made the point of like you know

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:03,700
for for

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:06,350
years now we have tried so hard to make

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,120
to make software and programming

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,430
independent of data to make code

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,990
independent of data right and yet all

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,310
code is meaningless without data and so

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,570
this is not hacker news coming so famous

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,940
computer scientist who said this and I'm

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,060
very embarrassed I forgot but anyway the

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:26,450
point is that you know the the merger of

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,670
code plus data is nothing new and in

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,960
fact it's kind of back to the Back to

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,880
the Future kind of right like it this is

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,140
what it's always been really and it's

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,730
just been the conceit of software

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,590
developers as a community as a

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,050
profession maybe that we just think

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,060
about code right and all of our code is

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,830
data independent code but actually we're

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,990
coming back now to where enterprise

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,910
applications at large and small scale

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,190
you know macro scale and micro scale

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:51,710
everything we're building all the code

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,120
is really there to serve business

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,860
functions that require some level of

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,690
data input so managing the data

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,790
provenance and data governance right is

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,020
nothing new right and we should never

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,730
have really believed we could get along

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,680
for as long as we did without thinking

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,080
about that as a first-class concern so I

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,730
think that's really at a high high level

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,590
we're coming back to you so all the

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,080
problems you know they're the same ones

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,210
we've always had we just can't silo them

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,900
anymore between well this is the DBAs

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,220
problem

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,810
here's your sequel query you know

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,270
credentials and you guys are software

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,220
developers so just write this like JDBC

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,430
bit right it's actually all going to

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,560
come back together fantastic one last

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,050
thing I'll wrap up with any good advice

00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,250
that you have you can share for people

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,050
who are starting out open source

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,790
projects they see a need but they're

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:37,070
just even beginning to learn how to

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,810
build a community mmm-hmm how you know

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,630
from your perspective having a business

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,550
based on open source but but what what's

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,650
what's really important that what really

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:51,080
matters to learn to try to start that so

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,690
building an open source code so if you

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,800
want to build an open source project

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,830
there's two parts that you have to get

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,780
right one is the code part and one is

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,570
the people part to get the code bit

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,460
right I would say that if you're going

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,200
to start an open source project do it

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,940
for the right reasons don't do it for

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,860
the kid up stars don't do it for the

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,490
fame don't do it for the glory because

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,770
there's not much right a lot more blood

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,960
sweat tears those things but actually

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,070
the way that I've seen open source

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,600
projects really become successful

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,010
whether they're like weekend hacks like

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,050
Fernando's little ipython project

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,000
whether you know it's like a West

00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,800
McKinney on pandas just coding hard for

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,650
years the ones have been really

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,720
successful are where the person who made

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,670
the code is doing it to scratch their

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,540
own itch and to scratch it really hard

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,630
yeah right

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:42,230
so on the code side be guided by your

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,510
own sort of technical desire and to try

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,070
to solve a problem right right and

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,690
really if you're the founder of a

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,100
project you have to hold a line on that

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,070
vision I have to own the technical

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,510
vision and that's one part of it the

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,040
other part of it those the people part

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,830
so successful open source projects have

00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,860
to have both and the people part is that

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,780
you have to be in addition to holding

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,870
the technical vision you have to

00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:08,660
essentially be able to conduct yourself

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:12,170
in such a fashion that you maintain

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,000
integrity in credibility right and the

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,860
Python community is absolutely fantastic

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,270
and amazing because as a technical

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,970
community its managed to grow and scale

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,800
and still hold that line other

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,390
communities have unfortunately fallen by

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,900
the side they don't have that

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,760
characteristic and so that's I think

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,830
that's the short and cute answer is that

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,690
actually integrity matters credibility

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,570
matters and as the leader of an

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,830
open-source project those you know it's

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,300
like the leader it's a basic leadership

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,400
I guess there's nothing different if you

00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,410
lead an organization a company a platoon

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,050
you have to have credibility and that

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,240
credibility comes through your openness

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,440
and kind of your integrity right

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,000

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,890
vision both of those things are

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,690
absolutely critical in order to build a

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,460
