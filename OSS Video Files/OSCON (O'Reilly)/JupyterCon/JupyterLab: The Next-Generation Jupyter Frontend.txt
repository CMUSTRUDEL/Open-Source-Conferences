	00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,389
thanks everyone for being here and I'm

00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:11,660
pleased to talk to you today with Chris

00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:14,690
and Ian about Jupiter lab and we are

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,840
here really as ambassadors for the rest

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,930
of the Jupiter lab team and project

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,240
Jupiter as a whole this is a huge effort

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,660
that's been going on for about two years

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,170
now and has involved many people some of

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,719
the key people are listed here and just

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,300
want to acknowledge also the broader

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,160
community that's participated in a wide

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,930
range of ways in terms of figuring out

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:44,239
what do we need to build the vision for

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:47,329
Jupiter lab etc just a quick outline so

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,890
I'm gonna begin mentioning our user

00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:50,180
experience testing that we're doing here

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,630
at Jupiter con that you can participate

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,300
in give a brief motivation for Jupiter

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,860
lab a roadmap and then Chris and Ian are

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,550
gonna come up and do the majority of the

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,009
talk with a live demo so we are doing

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,200
in-person user experience testing here

00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,259
at Jupiter con right down the hallway

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,389
here in the Gramercy room and we would

00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:14,479
love your help in improving our software

00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:16,700
we have four different activities that

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,609
you can participate in all day today and

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,200
tomorrow you can either just drop in or

00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:24,560
there's a sign-up sheet here if you want

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,469
to pick a particular time bitly jupiter

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,649
con - user testing and you can do

00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,329
anywhere from just one activity to all

00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,599
four activities the different activities

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:37,789
take between 15 minutes and 30 minutes

00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,299
and are covering a wide range of things

00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:44,060
from Jupiter lab to our documentation

00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:48,709
etc so please please stop by and help us

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,289
out so what motivated us to begin

00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:54,049
thinking about in building Jupiter lab

00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,399
in the earlier talk this morning we

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,859
addressed some of the challenges with

00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,249
the existing notebook the difficulty of

00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:02,810
maintaining it of extending it the fact

00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:06,590
that the classic notebook is written

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,649
using web technology of many years ago

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,129
and that that world is moving

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:15,730
speed ahead but but from a user's

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:18,129
perspective what's motivating Jupiter

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,379
lab so the classic Jupiter notebook as

00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,420
you may know is about more than just

00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,909
notebooks at this point the Jupiter

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,739
notebook in addition to having notebooks

00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,409
has a text editor

00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:33,430
it has an in-browser terminal it has a

00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:36,189
full-blown file browser and all of these

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,409
different things are needed for doing

00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,000
interactive computing with data or

00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,470
whether you're doing data science or

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,370
scientific computing or machine learning

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,430
usually you want to run the computation

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,650
where your your data is and that's often

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,959
not on your laptop and so a lot of our

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,060
users are starting to run Jupiter in a

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,250
context where the data is not on their

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,620
laptop they're connecting to some remote

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,560
system and at that point the Jupiter

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,030
notebook is your user interface not just

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,340
to writing that code but to the entire

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,889
system so having the file browser the

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,450
terminal all these other things become

00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,730
really important building blocks for

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,590
interactive computing and so that's

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,049
really how we've come to think of these

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,129
different things they're building blocks

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:24,190
for interactive computing and the

00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:26,650
important thing is that the classic

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,329
Jupiter notebook is not the only way of

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,829
assembling and integrating these

00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:36,069
different building blocks for example a

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:38,829
fantastic workflow that a lot of people

00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:42,150
love is that of our studio traditionally

00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:45,220
our studio allowed you to just edit

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,139
standalone our scripts and then select

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,840
blocks of our code to run them in

00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:52,419
something like a console a code console

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,370
it's a different workflow it still uses

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,709
the same abstractions for interactive

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,620
computing of having a place to type code

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,109
output etc but it's a different way of

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,329
assembling those building blocks and so

00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,370
the original vision for Jupiter lab from

00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:08,500
the users perspective was to provide a

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,389
more flexible way of working with those

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,879
same building blocks and assembling them

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:15,579
into however you need to be working with

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,310
your data so Jupiter lab is those same

00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,799
familiar building blocks plus the

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,079
following so the more flexible way of

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,900
using the building blocks

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,419
a modern JavaScript development

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,569
environment NPM based packaging we're

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,639
using typescript our underlying library

00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:36,090
that we're using for sort of the

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,879
application level logic is Foster ojs

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,199
we've got a clean model view separation

00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,909
to enable things like real-time

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,360
collaboration that we'll be talking

00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:48,030
about one of the really nice benefits of

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,009
typescript is that there's very cleanly

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,379
separated distinctions between public

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:55,409
and private api's and so we're working

00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:58,050
really hard to have public api's that

00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,969
are clean stable and as minimal as

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,560
possible while still owing a lot still

00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:04,349
allowing you to do the things you need

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,110
with them and the whole vision here is

00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:09,539
that yes jupiter lab out of the box

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,479
ships with these default building blocks

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,979
that you're familiar with but we want to

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,080
enable other people to go build

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,960
additional things that plug into jupiter

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,750
lab and extend it in many ways and then

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,279
we're also taking the chance to rethink

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,080
about the the design of these building

00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,900
blocks both the visual design the user

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,110
experience design and and modernizing

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,379
that aspect of it so next is a bit of

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,819
roadmap we hear a lot of questions of

00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,190
where's Jupiter live today when can we

00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,919
start using it so again we've been

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,490
working on Jupiter lab for about two

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,039
years now

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,500
and even a little bit before that there

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,319
was a lot of planning we've had 69

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,509
contributors to date and this is a

00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,139
little crazy a thousand and eighty two

00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:59,219
releases of our NPM packages and Python

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,150
packages already

00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:07,949
that's releases not commits and this is

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,539
largely due to the semi insane way that

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:14,339
front-end development is happening now

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:17,190
with many many NPM packages and we we

00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:22,349
have fought it and lost and so we have

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:25,259
many NPM packages we have around 11,000

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:27,690
commits in the main repositories in the

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,729
Jupiter lab organization this is already

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,649
more commits than we have in the classic

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,900
notebook so to give you a sense of the

00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,820
magnitude of work

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,080
that's gone into Jupiter lab we're

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,509
currently working through a series of

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,570
pre beta releases our current release

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:44,330
number is 0.27 which is not particularly

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,250
meaningful what you're more interested

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,830
in is the question when should you start

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,229
to use it and it really depends on how

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,600
adventurous you are here's the here's my

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:56,509
short summary the current pre beta

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,180
releases are fantastic for adventurous

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,789
users and developers right I'm actually

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,370
using Jupiter lab day-to-day when I'm

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,830
using the notebook and it's fantastic

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,860
but obviously I'm adventurous in that

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,770
sense the beta release which we're

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,870
hoping to come out relatively soon we

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,850
will recommend it for all users so from

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,860
the user perspective the beta release

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,460
will essentially be like a one dot over

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,960
zh n' but for developers the beta

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,500
release will still be for the

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,070
adventurous of you the one doto release

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,509
that we're hoping to get out late 2017

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,400
we will recommend for all users and

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:37,580
developers and the main thing we have

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,340
going on here is really wanting to

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,830
stabilize these api's because we will

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,660
want all of you to go and build things

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,930
on top of them and right now we are

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:51,020
still breaking the api's far too often

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,840
to recommend it for for general purpose

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,880
development eventually our plan is to

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,530
retire the classic notebook there's

00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,419
definitely going to be a transition

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,889
period once Jupiter Labuan dot o comes

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,710
out we're not going to immediately

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,090
retire the notebook we know a lot of you

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,560
who've built things on the classic

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,080
notebook and there's going to be a

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,270
transition there of everyone shifting

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,820
over to Jupiter lab and so we're aware

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,990
of that process and it will definitely

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,470
go on for a while

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,310
and so at this point i would like to

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:25,130
introduce jupiter lab almost beta and

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,930
have Chris Kohlberg come up and start to

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,229
show you a live demo of where we're at

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,229
today

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,149
you're good

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,120
oh good afternoon I think it's almost

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,340
afternoon is it afternoon yet it's

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
afternoon good afternoon so my name is

00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,060
Chris Kolbert I'm a Software Architect

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,420
at continuum continuum analytics I'm

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,830
also a co-creator of Jupiter lab and

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,390
lately I've been having the honor of

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,280
breaking all the rules and giving live

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,180
demos on alpha software so I'm gonna

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,560
continue that today and you know there's

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,910
some disclaimers there hopefully

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,740
everything works we're gonna we're gonna

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,030
hope some of them that might not but I

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,290
appreciate your patience with all of

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:10,550
that so as Brian mentioned Jupiter lab

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,960
well one of the main goals that we're

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,210
trying to do with Jupiter lab is bring

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,590
all of those building blocks that are in

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,350
the classic notebook plus some new stuff

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,880
under under one roof and so what does

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,380
that mean when we say under one roof

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,330
well what you're seeing here is Jupiter

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,410
lab this is live this is the 0.27

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,910
release that was released 26 hours ago

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,350
and so when you start it you're gonna

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,150
you're gonna see this actually in fact

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,470
if i refresh it when you when you first

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,660
start it you're gonna see a nice little

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,130
splash screen while it loads the

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,480
background for a couple seconds and then

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,700
I transition so this is what you see

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,110
when when you start Jupiter lab and what

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,640
you're presented with is the launcher

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,770
screen which is basically how you can

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,360
start all of these separate individual

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,270
building blocks within Jupiter lab and

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,860
so I can just click on this button here

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,840
and you know I'll get a notebook and

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,610
this is a this is a notebook like

00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,990
everybody is familiar with that's you

00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,700
know start to kernel automatically in

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,230
the background I can do my regular

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,810
notebook analysis sort of stuff on that

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:09,650
we have consoles for anybody that's used

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:12,980
to a QT console type development make

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,040
sure it my Python 3 syntax right which I

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,040
don't

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,099
so it's a regular console so this is

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,359
more of a linear type repple console

00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:26,009
that you would get and maybe the classes

00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:27,539
guide Python or QT console I can't go

00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,369
back and edit anything or any of that

00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:30,809
sort of stuff but it's useful to have

00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:32,429
and we'll see more how that ties into

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,199
the system as we go along in this talk

00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,970
some of the other things we have we have

00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,589
text editors just like the you have the

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,999
classic notebook or the you know the

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,129
classic notebook text editor

00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:43,229
this is a typical code mirror editor not

00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,599
much has changed in this between classic

00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:47,729
notebook and what you see here we also

00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:49,939
have the same terminal experience so

00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:52,979
this is a full terminal terminal

00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:58,829
emulator so I can actually run them in

00:10:52,979 --> 00:11:00,689
it I can also exit vim in it so so that

00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,549
that all works nice and so so this is

00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:04,529
nice so notice I'm not in multiple

00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:06,689
browser tabs here it's it's this is just

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,009
Jupiter lab but when we say we want to

00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:10,829
bring all those under one roof this

00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,359
isn't that great of a experience above a

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:14,909
normal browser tab if I can only see one

00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:16,619
thing at one time and so what Brian

00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,689
mentioned is that something about the

00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:20,579
phosphor jazz project which I develop

00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:22,470
which I created in concert in parallel

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,029
with Jupiter lab and what that serves

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,619
for us is the low-level widget

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,509
architecture you know widgets a very

00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,459
overloaded term the low level JavaScript

00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,439
tooling architecture that allows us to

00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,509
build applications like super lab and

00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:34,709
applications like Jupiter lab one of the

00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:36,359
things that it gives us is are very

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,129
flexible layout system which allows me

00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:40,499
to take these tabs drag them

00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:43,429
side-by-side and I can resize them and

00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:46,499
arrange really arrange my whole

00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,779
environment here to look exactly how I

00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:50,909
want with almost unlimited flexibility

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,199
so if you've got multiple 30-inch

00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:53,849
monitors and you want to drag all this

00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:55,349
stuff across multiple screens you can do

00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:57,479
that and you can arrange the system

00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:59,189
however it makes sense for your monitor

00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:00,809
and your workflow and so that's really

00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,819
what we mean by we say we want to bring

00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,409
all of this under one roof we don't want

00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,999
to constantly have two contacts which

00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:08,869
mentally between different browser tabs

00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:12,979
and interrupt interrupt our workflows

00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:12,979
clean up my screen here a little bit

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,370
so one thing I want to show is over shot

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,110
over here I've got file browser I'll

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,459
talk about a little bit in a second but

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,899
one of the ways that I can open things

00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,339
which you can't do as easily in the

00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,730
classic notebook is I can just drag and

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,740
drop from my file browser onto my my

00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,300
page and I can open literally whatever I

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,160
have in my file system that's accessible

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,380
to me and so this is a reasonably

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,760
complex notebook and it exists to show

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,529
that notebooks are still notebooks so

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,240
this is not the classic notebook we're

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,740
not a framing classic notebook into

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,200
Jupiter lab here this is a brand new

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,300
implementation of the ipython notebook

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,279
uses the same protocols under the covers

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,510
uses the same notebook format an

00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,880
important thing to point out is that

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,290
Jupiter lab is not a reimplementation or

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,880
a new implementation of the notebook

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,040
format or any of the protocols or any of

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,540
that kind of stuff it's just a new front

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,570
end that exists on top of all of that

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,670
existing architecture but what this new

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,019
implementation is allowed us to do is

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,130
more flexibly implement some of the

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,110
features that lots of people have been

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,760
asking for for example I can expand and

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,740
collapse cells which we haven't been

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,269
able to do in the classic notebook I can

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,370
also drag and drop cells move them

00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:20,850
around my notebook one of the other

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,100
things I can do is now that we have this

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,839
flexible doc panel arrangement system I

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,149
can actually drag and drop cells between

00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,380
notebooks so if you have some notebooks

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,550
that are just scratched pads of stuff

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,959
and you want to start dragging and

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,810
dropping to build up more complex

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,790
workflows more complex notebooks we can

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,730
now do that one of the features that

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,950
that landed just last night or just in

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,140
the 27 release if I right-click on this

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,420
I can actually get a new view into the

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,390
same notebook so this is a view that's

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,990
actually that's a bug it opened up on

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,610
the wrong one

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:56,670
so live software so let's try that one

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,920
more time new view into file here there

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,720
we go this one worked so I get a new

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,279
view into the same notebook I can drag

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,320
them side-by-side and if I've got a

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,610
really large notebook like this is and I

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,990
need to scroll down to the bottom of it

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,610
to do work in one part of the notebook

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,470
whilst a scrolled up to do view in the

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,640
different part of the document I can do

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,959
that so anybody that's used to the

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,949
workflow and like sublime text or your

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,480
editor where you've got to huge a

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:16,680
document two of them side-by-side I do

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,680
that all the time

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,689
so we have that in Jupiter lab now

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,939
so some of the other things some of the

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,410
other features that are in the classic

00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,790
notebook experience that it made its way

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,430
over to Jupiter lab but in a different

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,050
form of the UI one of them is this file

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,879
browser that I kind of been dragging and

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,800
dropping stuff around before so this is

00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,899
also bread come Britt bread crumbs based

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,459
like in the classic notebook except it

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,740
just exists in the sidebar tab that I

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,089
can expand and collapse depending on you

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,699
know how much space I want it to take up

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,230
on my screen all of that's resizable you

00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:48,749
can you know navigate your filesystem

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,069
just like you would in a regular in a

00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:52,439
regular file browser so that should be

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:54,480
you know pretty pretty familiar to most

00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:56,579
people another thing that we have that

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,809
now exists in the classic notebook but

00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,819
again in a different UI form is a

00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,980
command palette ours exists in a side

00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:03,569
side panel now so it's searchable and

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,730
filterable it's fuzzy search so

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,709
basically any any command that you might

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,329
want to execute for all the different

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:11,670
plugins that are existing in Jupiter lab

00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:13,800
will show up in this fuzzy searchable

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,119
command palette which if you don't know

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,160
what you're looking for can't be a lot

00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:21,629
faster than trying to hunt for it in one

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:25,949
of these top-level menus okay let's see

00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:27,209
so now one of the things that Jupiter

00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,620
lab is intended to do when we're talking

00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:31,649
about bringing everything under one roof

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,059
it wouldn't be that great if all we

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,439
could do was you know see multiple

00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:36,120
things simultaneously and working them

00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:38,189
independently I mean that's good but

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,720
it's not great one of the things that

00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,309
would make it great is if we can get

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,230
those things to communicate with each

00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:44,790
other across the different UI views of

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,009
the same data models and one way that we

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,839
can do that is with our support for

00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,220
markdown now typically the data

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,660
scientist we like to write a lot of

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,550
markdown code whether you're doing it in

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,110
the actual notebook whether you're doing

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,720
in a readme file you're trying to build

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,819
the narrative around the project that

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,379
you're doing and around your data and a

00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:02,850
typical workflow for that might you

00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,470
might be right your markdown and hit

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,699
compile and then open it up in another

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,199
tab of your browser see what it looks

00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,569
like rinse and repeat it's a very

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,549
laborious way of writing markdown

00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,589
because it takes a long time what we can

00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,540
do in Jupiter lab is I can open a new

00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,670
view into this markdown file and I can

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,350
open it with a markdown preview and I

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,509
can set these two things right next to

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,639
each other and now as i write my

00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:28,459
markdown code

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,170
if I can type live as I write my

00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,179
markdown code my live preview updates

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,709
and the reason that it does this is

00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,329
because at the core fundamental

00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:37,009
architecture of Jupiter lab we've

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,749
separated our views from our models so

00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,970
I've only got one model of that markdown

00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,290
document loaded in memory and I've got

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,179
multiple views that are pointing into

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,709
that that transformed that data into

00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,259
whatever representation I want to see it

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,459
on the screen now this is really cool so

00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,589
I can write my bark down that's a lot

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,999
faster to do it you know I can see what

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,769
it's going to look like as I'm doing it

00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:56,420
one of the other advantages that we had

00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,429
to this is I can actually create a

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,189
console attached to my text editor now

00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:02,360
and I'm gonna run it with Python 3 and

00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,370
you know you put it over here so I can

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,899
see it and now all these blocks of code

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,520
and markdown that typically you'd have

00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,480
to copy and paste into another runtime

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,669
to figure out if they're gonna execute

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,770
it or not I can just put my cursor in

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:14,539
these blocks of code hit shift enter and

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,850
I'll send that code to the console and

00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,949
it'll run and it'll make sure that my

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,159
code actually runs correctly before I

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,510
ever save and commit my markdown files

00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:25,549
and so that's the kind of interaction

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,990
and the linking between the datas and

00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,909
our views and the transformations

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,870
between models and views that that's

00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:31,490
really what we're talking about we're

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,690
saying bringing all of this under under

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,250
one roof so it's not just how we're

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,510
gonna lay it on our page but it's how

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,220
these various components can now

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:43,399
communicate with each other in the same

00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:45,889
environment so one of the other things

00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:48,679
that we have on this in terms of trying

00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:51,649
to make your workflow a bit easier this

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,029
type of multiple multi pane panel layout

00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:54,710
that's really cool cuz I can see a lot

00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:56,090
of stuff at one time but sometimes I

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,470
want to see just what I'm working on

00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,850
like right now like all I really care

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,799
about is what's in this console and I

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,480
might want to have that take up you know

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,039
more more real estate on my screen and I

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,409
can kind of do that manually by starting

00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,760
to you know collapse some stuff down but

00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,350
that's a little bit of a manual

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,539
laborious process and so let me go back

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,799
to how it was before what we've added in

00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:14,539
Jupiter lab is what we call single

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,159
document mode so if I'm in a tab that's

00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,899
focused I can hit command shift enter

00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,520
and go into single document mode which

00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:21,590
blows that thing up that I care about to

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,020
full script more or less full screen you

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,309
know if I close my my file down here now

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,080
or more or less full screen but it's

00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,669
it's kind of like what I'm focused on at

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,750
the moment and so I can do what I care

00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,490
about and see you have all my real

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,990
estate look at my big box maybe interact

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,580
with some widgets and when I'm done with

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,040
that I hit command shift enter again and

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,440
it takes me

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,970
back to where I was so we're really

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,620
trying to add the features that allow

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,880
you as a data science developer when

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,470
you're interactively working with stuff

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,730
to work on what you care about and how

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,810
you care about it in the ways that you

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,980
want to do it pick up some more my

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,960
screen here so now I want to talk a

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,850
little bit about some of the other

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,220
support for different file types that we

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,600
have here so I've got kind of a demo

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,630
directory set up here and it's got some

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,100
stuff in it that you might find in your

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,810
regular workflow so you know we have

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,160
some images and I can drag and drop I

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,990
can see an image or image viewer you can

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,610
zoom + - reset so you know p.m. G's

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,380
gifts gifs however you say it

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,910
JPEGs whatever you want all those are

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,100
supported so standard browser format

00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,030
images we have those we have support for

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,980
geo JSON so if you've got geo JSON files

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:25,590
this just brought users leaflet to show

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,300
that immediately what else do we have so

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,620
you got support for Vega light so I can

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,660
bring a big a light file in here

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,520
and what I like to point out with the

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,010
Vega light so Vega light is just a JSON

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,930
format right it's just a plot rendering

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,970
based on some JSON data so that means we

00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,170
can actually look at the underlying JSON

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,150
data at the same time so I'm going to

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,220
open up a JSON editor here and I want to

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,530
use these side-by-side and so now I can

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,110
actually interactively introspect the

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,460
content of that Vega light plot because

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,710
we've got a little interactive JSON

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,360
viewer but at the same time since all of

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,070
these are actually viewing just the same

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,350
underlying data model I can actually

00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,880
open up that JSON file the Vega light

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,010
JSON file in an editor and I can

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,020
actually go down here and change this

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,460
point mark to circle and in just a

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,380
couple seconds my plot will refresh

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,570
because again these are all live linked

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,250
views to the same underlying data models

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,900
so it's not like we special cased

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,430
markdown files and said okay we're gonna

00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,840
have live marked on preview and whenever

00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,550
you whenever you add in a markdown file

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,650
we'll make sure we update all abuse this

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,330
works for any file you write a viewer

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,640
for in Jupiter lab like it's something

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,470
you get for free it's not and the people

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,910
that wrote the viewers for these there's

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,380
no extra code they had to write you just

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,850
write a viewer as if it's just a viewer

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,710
and our architecture under the covers

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,160
takes care of making sure everything is

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,480
synchronized so you get that for free

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,640
one of the other things we we use a lot

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,070
in data science or our CSV files see if

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,500
I can come out of full screen here but

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,020
what about really big CSV files so on my

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,280
desktop here I've got big CSV it's about

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,690
a 200 megabyte CSV file and

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,270
we might just double-click it and try to

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,310
open an excel now I've done this before

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,010
this is going to take a while and so I'm

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,080
gonna let it run but in the meantime I'm

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,650
going to open up a different file on my

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,080
system here in Jupiter lab called small

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,420
CSV and small is relative it's about

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,460
twelve thousand twelve thousand rows but

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,170
it opened instantly and if he tried to

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,730
do this in the classic notebook it would

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,260
take about 45 seconds they need to end

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,520
up with a table that has pagers and you

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,590
page through a thousand rows at a time

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,030
and every time you hit a page it takes a

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,370
couple seconds to load the next few

00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,780
thousand rows and the new CSV grid

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,280
viewer widget that's still in

00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,980
development so this is still pre-alpha

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,570
but it's just butter smooth and I can I

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,760
can scroll through all twelve thousand

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,770
rows of this all the columns are

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,620
interactively resizable and there's

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,650
absolutely no lag between loading the

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,800
data and viewing your data so I think

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:44,020
Excel is has done something it says file

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,900
not loaded completely alright so let's

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,300
see what it gave us so I think this is

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,730
1.2 million rows it didn't load all of

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,500
them because it exceeded excels capacity

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,200
but as I scroll through this it's really

00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:01,210
janky like I like I would I wouldn't

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:03,820
work with this because it's awful but so

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,440
let's try opening this in in Jupiter lab

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,300
so this is transferring to our megabytes

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,340
across the network CSV file and then

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,450
parsing it and then throwing in a data

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,330
grid so it's going to take a couple

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:15,930
seconds Excel took a couple minutes but

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,120
it loads in about eight or nine seconds

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:22,360
and this is and this is all 1.2 million

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,960
rows and there's no perceptible lag when

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,430
I scroll through this now some of you

00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,930
might say like 1.2 million rows that's

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,810
not that big I've got bigger data sets

00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:34,120
than that so I have what I call to keep

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,130
me honest example and this actually

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,960
exists as an example on foster Genesis

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,690
page so the grid itself is a phosphor JS

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,010
component and what I have here I've got

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,330
you know five different grids some of

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,800
them have streaming rows some of them

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,830
have ticking data some of them are all

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,660
highlighted based on data values let's

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,950
try not to change page here

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,900
some of them are highlighted based on

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,060
their their data values but the one in

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,179
the top left corner is actually a 1

00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:00,070
trillion row by 1 trillion column data

00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,460
set and I could scroll through that in

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,710
real time

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,389
- and I can also interactively resize

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,869
the rows and columns with trillion row

00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:09,039
datasets so again this this grid widgets

00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,600
in development we still need to add

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,610
things like selections and editing and

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,350
some other stuff standard features that

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,090
you'd want from an interactive grid but

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,649
the read-only side of showing big data

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,090
is there and the rendering pipeline and

00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:21,340
the performance is there so just more

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,830
work to do but we'll eventually get

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,059
there so what I want to wrap up with

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,460
here in terms of this feature

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,860
demonstration everything that I've

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,659
demoed today from the terminals to the

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,610
consoles to the notebooks to the grid

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:35,230
viewers to the Geo JSON to the JSON

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,240
viewers to the vago Lite they're all

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,009
implemented as extensions to Jupiter lab

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
that are no more or less privileged than

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:42,009
the extensions you would write yourself

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,840
we're using the same API is the same

00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:45,669
plug-in architecture everything that you

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,830
would want to do to write the extensions

00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:51,070
for your workflow or customize your UI's

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:53,889
or your views like if you we can do it

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,110
like we use that same API so really this

00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:58,149
guy is literally the limit and one of

00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,259
the most promising extensions that we

00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:59,619
have actually working in development

00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:01,509
right now

00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:03,129
ian's going to come up and demo for us

00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:06,310
and it's talking about real time

00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:13,890
collaboration with in super lab

00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:15,940
[Applause]

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:19,000
is this working

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:22,240
okay so one of the most commonly

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,040
requested features for jupiter notebooks

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,470
is better support for all kinds of

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,050
collaboration as scientists we like to

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,870
collaborate and notebooks have not

00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,670
always had the cleanest story for that

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,550
for for collaboration and collaboration

00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,830
can exist on many timescales that you

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,720
know ranging from emailing things back

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,760
and forth to things that are more

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,400
familiar to developers like us like get

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,960
based workflows to things that happen in

00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,450
real time and i'm going to be focusing

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,080
on real time collaboration i will note

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,630
in passing that brian has some students

00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,450
who are working on a git plugin for

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,190
jupiter lab which is still in early

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,260
development but is looking very

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:06,700
promising so keep your eyes peeled for

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:09,070
that if you like get based workflows but

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,490
for now I'm going to be pointing your

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,110
attention to this tab at the side here

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,310
this is a third-party extension that

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,010
I've been working on for Jupiter lab

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,350
which it gives integration with Google

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:23,100
Drive so you can upload your files to

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:26,410
Google Drive access them from anywhere

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,660
but what it also provides is integration

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,250
with Google drive's real time

00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,470
capabilities these are the things that

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,660
power Google Docs that you that

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:41,700
presumably many people have seen and

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:47,230
collaborated with on with colleagues so

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:50,860
central to most collaboration workflows

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,090
is the idea of resolving conflicts and

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:56,830
that sounds like a bit of a sociological

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:59,380
statement but and it is but but it's

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,670
also a technical problem if two people

00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,840
are editing the same document you're

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,070
gonna run into conflicts you know you're

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,380
going to need some way of resolving

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:09,280
those now with uh with get frequently

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,260
you resolve those manually in a

00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,590
real-time context it's much more

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,120
difficult because

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,710
manually manually resolving conflicts

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,160
while more than one person is in the

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,330
same document is going to be such a pain

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,710
that you're pretty much never going to

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,620
want to do it if the typing experience

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,850
is

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,980
so you're always having to resolve

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,710
conflicts nobody's going to want to use

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,750
the tool so one of the reasons that

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,480
we're starting out using Google Drive is

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:40,390
that it provides a it provides an API

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:43,670
for resolving these conflicts and that

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,020
winds up being a good place for us to

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,059
start in terms of doing real-time

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:52,300
collaboration so I'm going to start off

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:55,340
by opening an example markdown file

00:26:52,300 --> 00:27:00,500
which hopefully so you can see right

00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:03,130
right that was this yeah yes I can try

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,130
to enlarge the font

00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,620
if I can exit full-screen mode

00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,850
shift-command enter

00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,320
now that's single document

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,419
there we go okay so this is the

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,620
this is the same split screen that that

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,110
Krista demoed a moment ago

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,960
but right now I'm not doing any of the

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:44,950
editing so my hands are up but we can

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,290
see that we can see that Brian and Chris

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,090
are both editing this document if I

00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,040
hover over this caret you can see

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:56,740
Brian's name shows up and there's Chris

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:58,180
and they're you know I guess adding

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,510
various things that we did not plan to

00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:04,570
have planned ahead of time okay so this

00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,040
is cool but you're presumably not here

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:10,360
only for markdown files you're also here

00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:13,510
to look at notebooks so I'm also going

00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,970
to open a demo notebook that we set it

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:22,600
for this equation just for some context

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:28,930
what happened here what was that yeah

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:31,530
but thanks thanks was that Paul okay so

00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:34,240
just for some context this notebook is a

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:36,190
as a demo notebook I set up that solves

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,980
the one-dimensional heat equation this

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:43,300
is the equation that prompted Fourier to

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,770
invent Fourier analysis so we you know

00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,630
I'm not going to really talk about what

00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:50,890
it does except to say that it you set up

00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:54,550
you give it some initial conditions and

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:56,400
watch heat flow away from your initial

00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,470
conditions so if I run this notebook oh

00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:02,080
that's funny that that equation doesn't

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,550
really look right that's that's not the

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,860
equation for the 1d heat equation that's

00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,960
the equation for the quadratic formula

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,680
okay so what I've done here is I've

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,810
opened up the the chat box that we've

00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,170
set up for this and Brian has hopefully

00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,370
given me the correct equation so the

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,460
neat thing about this chat box is that

00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,780
this is these are markdown cells so I

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,460
can actually click and drag them into

00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,340
the notebook and now I have the right

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:31,600
equation and now we'll delete this

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:34,370
incorrect one okay so

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,309
so now I'm gonna try to run this

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:40,820
notebook so I'm stepping through running

00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,269
these cells and I'll run this last one

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,570
okay

00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:46,190
so this gave me an error because it

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,110
turns out that Brian's laptop doesn't

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,809
actually have the libraries installed

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,240
that I wanted so hope so thankfully

00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:56,049
Brian just reran it on my laptop which

00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:01,070
is sitting right there which gave the

00:29:56,049 --> 00:30:02,690
which ran the simulation made an HTML

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,340
video pushed that video across the

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:09,350
network and showed up right here without

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:15,950
me having to run it on this machine so

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:19,220
this is let's see and the same thing you

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,200
saw previously in the markdown file is

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,350
the case here there are cursors that we

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,110
can see moving around and editing text

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,639
so for instance we could change the

00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:33,080
initial conditions to something else and

00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:38,809
Cincy it live update there we go in any

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:42,019
event so I would note that what we saw

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:43,760
here was two different laptops that were

00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:47,120
running two different kernels and that

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,399
was why we wound up seeing you know a

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,679
different set of libraries installed

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,750
this is one of the things that makes a

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,130
real-time collaboration in a notebook

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,720
setting different from just a plain

00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,490
document setting where there's actually

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,019
live computation involved in there are

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,269
different models we're talking about for

00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:03,830
how to actually handle this ranging for

00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:05,840
something like this where you actually

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,789
do have multiple kernels and people have

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,889
can have different types of execution

00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:12,230
results two more shared kernel

00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:13,700
environments and sort of hybrid hybrid

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,080
approaches so this is this is all very

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:19,639
much a work in progress and we're trying

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,679
to still hammer out the best ways that

00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:23,450
are the ways that are most useful to

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,549
people so we're interested in feedback

00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,350
we're interested in people to play we're

00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:30,169
interested in people playing with this

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,570
and letting us know what they think and

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:34,100
with that I think I'll invite Brian and

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,010
Chris back up here and we can field

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:45,319
questions

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:45,319
[Applause]

00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:02,280
[Music]

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,720
so so the question was if we had plan

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,110
upon having the real-time collaboration

00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,660
available at the first beta beta release

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,039
its available now for experimentation I

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,530
would say it's lagging a little behind

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,090
Jupiter lab in terms of recommended for

00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:18,650
general usage and I would recommend it

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,650
more for experimentation right now

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,150
[Music]

00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:32,720
yeah it requires you to log in through

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,720
your Google account yes

00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,089
[Music]

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:50,460
so we have support so the question is we

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:52,919
talked a lot about markdown and moreless

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,990
what about restructured text and so

00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,299
they're there so there's two different

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:59,070
languages essentially for creating a

00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:01,409
documents restructure text is much more

00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:03,750
complicated than markdown so markdown is

00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:04,919
really handy for things like where you

00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,330
want to annotate some cells in a

00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,590
notebook or write some readme files

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,570
where you don't need a lot of complex

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,580
cross linking or other other

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:15,870
post-processing of documents writing a

00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,610
Jupiter super lab extension that

00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,860
supported restructured text is

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:21,870
immediately like you could do that today

00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,029
so there aren't any immediate plans for

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,980
us to do that as part of core the core

00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:28,549
Jupiter lab team but that's definitely

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,130
something that could be community driven

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:36,539
so another answer to that that we didn't

00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:39,720
show in the recent release Ian added a

00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:42,000
PDF viewer that's within the doc panel

00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,250
and so what what this opens the door for

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,570
is other input formats lot tack

00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,480
restructured text that can generate PDF

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:54,090
files for us to begin building workflows

00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,019
that involve those other formats and can

00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:01,590
render the appropriate format such as

00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:03,360
PDF or HTML but again the important

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,970
thing is all the infrastructure of

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,280
real-time collaboration of the modelview

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,470
separation all still works with those

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,909
other formats so that's shouldn't be

00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:17,210
hard for us or some of you to implement

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,210
the TS

00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,250
so the question is what if you're using

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,560
Jupiter lab and something doesn't work

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,240
and you want to go to the classic

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,440
notebook what what can you do at that

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:36,500
point and the answer is in the help menu

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,510
we have a launch classic notebook that

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,510
Chris is showing right now that will

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,460
launch the classic notebook and it's not

00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:47,119
showing the treeview here because I'm

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:51,320
running a version of the classic

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,330
notebook that has a bug a dev version

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,159
but that's an issue a bug with the

00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,230
classic notebook that we've fixed in the

00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,000
release version of it so go to help

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,910
launch classic notebook and you've got

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,470
everything that you have been using so

00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,470
far great question thanks

00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,270
yeah so the question is can we talk

00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,460
about the git plugin so this summer

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,180
we've had some interns at Cal Poly and

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,220
one of the teams of interns has been

00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,140
building a git plugin it consists both

00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,530
of a server extension that exposes a

00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:32,950
REST API to sort of common git commands

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:36,730
and then a user interface that appears

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:38,280
in the Left panel that basically are our

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,510
target audience there is

00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,410
beginner-to-intermediate get users

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:46,780
trying to simplify the the daily aspects

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,730
of working with git so we're thinking

00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,310
very carefully about how to encode to

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:54,310
get abstractions with good visual

00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:56,590
encoding giving you access to sort of

00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:59,170
the type of information that you get

00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:01,600
from git status and get logged but with

00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:05,730
a very nice carefully thought through

00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,110
and designed user interface and so that

00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,720
we're getting close to having a release

00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,940
ready of that it's not not out yet but

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,370
it's going to be basically a Python

00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,190
package that has the notebook server

00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:20,680
extension and then a standard Jupiter

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,750
lab extension for the user interface and

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,900
and we'd love feedback about that as

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,900
well

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,710
the answer is yes

00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:54,200
for further camera steve demoed trooper

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,890
lab with jupiter hub yesterday during

00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:00,430
the live tutorial I think Aaron give a

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,430
question

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:09,079
[Music]

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,770
so those two should be linked since

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,460
they're gonna have a common object on

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,049
the server where you talking about

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,369
cheaper widgets so those two will

00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:28,730
reflect the same state they both

00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,730
notebooks

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,520
so the question is if you have multiple

00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,950
views into the same file how does how

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,960
does state sharing between jupiter

00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,010
widgets in those multiple notebooks how

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,470
has that taken care of

00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,580
and if somebody in the audience might

00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:55,520
correct me if i'm wrong about this but

00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,140
if I understand correctly all of this

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,109
state that's necessary to recreate the

00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,240
UI for a particular widget is share is

00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:03,890
actually lives on the server as well as

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,780
on the front-end and so when one widget

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,760
changes the state changes his own state

00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,410
that state is shipped to the server

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,970
which will have which will make its

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,619
modification and then broadcast those

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,720
same updates back to any listening views

00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:16,670
so then the other view that is

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,830
displaying the equivalent front-end

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:24,490
widget for that back-end server object

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:24,490
will have the same state yes

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:32,859
decent ground over on the right

00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:35,980
I can see him smiling and thinking about

00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:38,380
this it in principle what what we're

00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,250
saying should be the case I think Jason

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:44,349
is Wiley hedging a little bit

00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,349
[Music]

00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:11,190
okay so for the second one I'll come

00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,740
find you afterwards and we'll get it

00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,110
working and then for the first one it's

00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,640
important to note that the The Notebook

00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:19,140
document format is the same for the

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,910
classic notebook and for Jupiler lab and

00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:27,830
so the the rendering capabilities that

00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,830
github has should be maintained

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,130
[Music]

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,850
yes so that's it that's a really good

00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:42,770
question so so the question is what

00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:46,040
about classic notebook extensions and do

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,150
they run in Jaipur lab so I know Brian

00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,100
mentioned the previous talk I don't know

00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:52,760
if he touched on it in this talk but

00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,740
historically the the the JavaScript API

00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,630
is there the structure of the DOM and

00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,340
the CSS classes that exist in classic

00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,230
notebook kind of became a de-facto

00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,240
public API but they were never intended

00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,800
as a public API and since they were

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,720
never intended as a public API it makes

00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,610
extending and modifications and

00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,100
enhancing the features of the classic

00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,690
notebook very difficult that's one of

00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,370
the reasons we wrote Jupiter lab and

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,410
rewrote the notebook in the process of

00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,570
that is because like we were basically

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,500
our hands were hands were tied in terms

00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,110
of what we can do with the classic

00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,550
notebook so the answer to the direct

00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:25,010
answer that question is that it depends

00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:27,820
on the complexity of the extension for

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,800
extensions that are basically just using

00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,090
the the notebook cell as a host for

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,280
content that's managed by another

00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,620
library those are those will be very

00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,790
easy to almost trivial support because

00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,110
all you need is a host node and

00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,600
everything else is kind of its kind of

00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,610
like separation boundary there but for

00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,110
extensions that are using jQuery to look

00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,000
up particular parts of the notebook in

00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,680
particular nodes that exist in a Cell

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,790
based on class ain't none of that's

00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,160
going to work because all of that has

00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,440
changed so the Dom structure itself has

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,780
changed and now explicitly our Dom

00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,160
structure is now not a public API and

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,230
that's enforced with our extension

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,300
system and with typescript so we give

00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,920
you the API is that you need to put any

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,780
content that you want in the right place

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,760
that's completely independent of our Dom

00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,380
structure and CSS classes and all of

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,670
that so so the answer is that it really

00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,670
it really depends on the extension

00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,580
so actually everything that you see in

00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,740
this jupiter lab is an extension so

00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,170
though that menu bar was populated by

00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,460
extensions into jupiter left absolutely

00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,870
you could you could you could you can

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,490
add to the menu bar you can add to

00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,870
context menus you can add to the command

00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,310
palette you can add your own stuff to

00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:43,140
the side bars you can add your own

00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,640
document renderers like that everything

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,060
that you saw in the demo today is an

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,060
extension

00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,760
no I would say not four not four beta so

00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,680
we're calling beta as a 1 dot o for

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,820
users so as a user of Jupiter lab we're

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,290
not we're gonna make sure that the

00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,970
experience that you get would you feel a

00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:07,450
beta it doesn't doesn't change as it can

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:08,710
as a keyboard user as a developer we

00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:18,550
just need a little we need till the end

00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:20,530
of 2017 to settle things down if you

00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,830
have if you can tolerate that level of

00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,900
turn go for it but but it is even we

00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,950
have trouble of just updating our own

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,950
extensions right now

00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:36,539
I guess we're out of time we will be

00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:39,750
around the particular finest at the

00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:40,950
Jupiter booth thank you very much

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,580
[Applause]
