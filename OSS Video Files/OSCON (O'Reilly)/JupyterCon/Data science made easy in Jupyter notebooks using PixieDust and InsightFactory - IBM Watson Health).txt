	00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,320
so you're lucky today we have three

00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,139
presenter and there's a reason for this

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,120
because we are talking about blurring

00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:12,129
the line between data scientists

00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,839
developers and line of business users

00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,059
and hopefully you have the three

00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,609
personas here my name is David I am a

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,539
distinguished engineer at IBM Watson

00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,949
data platform

00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:32,560
and I'm going to be playing the role of

00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:34,030
a developer and I'm Faisal Farooq I'm a

00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,899
machine learning scientist at Bagram but

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,570
today I'm going to play the role

00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:41,410
basically of a business user and an

00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:46,079
analyst so dearly beloved we are

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:49,320
gathered here why are we here right so

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,930
we all know this right you know that

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,640
there's this huge explosion of data

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,800
enterprises you know they're gathering

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,660
more data 100 you know gather insights

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,280
from all this data the good news is the

00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,260
data the bad news is the data you know

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,390
that data brings lots of problems but

00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,759
again lots of opportunities with it

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,030
right so the basic core of the message

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:13,810
today here is in an enterprise you know

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,280
that's trying to do data science right

00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,220
you know to glean insights from the data

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,680
there's lots of personas involved it's

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,780
not just the data science much as we

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,610
would like for job security it's not

00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,710
really just only the data scientists

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,390
right there's lots of personas in the

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,810
whole enterprise so let's just take an

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,640
example of a healthcare enterprise and a

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,619
workflow would be you know right from

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,409
the top if a CFO wants to know why we're

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:41,200
losing money for example on a you know

00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,720
Medicare Shared savings program and the

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,000
medical officer may ask the same

00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,310
question in different way we are losing

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,229
money because my diabetic patients are

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,610
getting hospitalized a lot so why are

00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,320
they getting hospice right and that

00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,090
question goes down to the director who

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,890
then asks the question to the data

00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,799
scientist you know the only cool guy in

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,039
the slide basically right so he's just

00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:06,939
one piece of the puzzle right so so what

00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,490
we hear one see is how we can make

00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,170
Jupiter pervasive across the spectrum

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,690
and not just a tool

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,540
anybody that attended this morning's

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,579
keynote

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,590
you know we still think of Jupiter as

00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:22,890
geeky stuff right it's still the tool

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,569
right so so we want what more to make

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,120
sure is that Jupiter is pervasive across

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,040
the spectrum and let's let's you know

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,930
this is this is slide where I kind of

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,220
draw a parallel between the Industrial

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,829
Revolution and data science right you

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,230
know we back in the day we had cottage

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:39,420
industry we had artisans working and

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,030
they're you know back in the day we had

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,629
machine learning researchers working on

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,250
one of code custom math and now you know

00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:48,900
that's the sort that's the person and

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,409
the British we'll be playing today right

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,150
now that now I 2.0 this version we

00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:55,739
started having practitioners and

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,389
developers getting into the mix right

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,980
you know it Darris I started getting

00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:02,700
mainstream not no longer MATLAB and and

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,129
simulations right it started getting

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,970
mainstream and we have David in the

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,739
David persona and moving onwards now

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,530
there's data science to be used by the

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,720
actual business user right so so how do

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,579
we how do we what so we want to Pater's

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,819
exceed you know we know it originated

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,709
from academia it's a good UI still used

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,690
as a tool but we want we want it to

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,760
succeed in an enterprise setting right

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,569
so you don't have repeatability you know

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,180
standardization you have workflows you

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,400
have collaboration across users and

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,400
multiple personas can use it so to

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,859
enable that we at IBM when i say we we

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,530
had I B M you know we want this to

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:45,329
succeed so we actually had to Jupiter

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,489
extensions pixie dust which is an

00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,349
open-source Python library that David

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,060
will talk about and then in size Factory

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,349
which is a Productivity extension that

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,449
Twitter's will talk about we have demos

00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,819
for each and then we also have a demo

00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,049
together to unleash the power of this in

00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,819
an enterprise setting with this I'll

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:06,449
hand this over to David thank you so

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:08,720
glasses pixie dust as I promise to you

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:11,159
we want to blur the line between

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,540
developer and data scientist you know

00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,879
the power of Jupiter you're all like

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,190
Jupiter you are all of Jupiter but it is

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,509
quite intimidating sometimes just

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:24,029
writing a simple chart can be quite a

00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,770
few line of code and and documentation

00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,150
so there is a really four step that we

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,540
want to automate or make it simpler with

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,100
just import data visualize the data

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,850
explore the data and build a dashboard

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,070
all of those we try we fix it us to to

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,380
enable you to do that kind of things and

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,020
hopefully to have a better collaboration

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,880
between developer and data scientist and

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,520
line of business users so let's look at

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,430
the feature at a glance visualized data

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,860
well there's only one API display you

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,300
display and that's all you need to know

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,310
you don't need to know Matt totally we

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,759
don't need to know bouquet Seabourn map

00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,979
box

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,350
google map whatever you do that and you

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,000
get a right away and interactive

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,729
environment where you can pick and

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,590
choose your columns pick C apps is the

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,990
way for developer to be able to write in

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,060
the notebook build some UI and and

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,490
workflow and we're going to show you a

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,000
lot of demo on that it's very heavy on

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,160
demo today there's also other things

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,030
pixie dust try to be agnostic on on on

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,889
the data in support pandas sparks

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,740
streaming streaming data and all of this

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,650
to allow you not to spend too much time

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,300
on the manual on the documentation right

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,210
so you you should you should be able to

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,639
do all this with a very simple api's

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,960
without reading the documentation just a

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,610
quick word about that patchy spark

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,919
because I think it's it's important

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,050
Apache spark is one of the most popular

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,990
project on Apache allow you to do

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,760
parallel computing at scale it's the

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,800
next generation Hadoop I'm not going to

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,300
say much about this but it's something

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,880
really if you guys are doing big data

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,409
analysis you should really take a look

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,479
at it without further ado why I would

00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:09,510
like to give you a demo so for this I'm

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:12,280
gonna switch to the IBM offering called

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:15,370
data science experience it's basically

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,380
an IDE it's cloud based you can go there

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,440
today and sign up it provides you with

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,870
notebooks and a complete idea of assets

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,500
that you can you can you can use it has

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,380
it has

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,840
machine learning data storage there are

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,690
sets catalogs and so on for this I

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,449
created a project called Jupiter Khan

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,219
when I go in in Jupiter Khan I have a

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:37,930
notebook called hello world picks you up

00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:41,430
so let's take a look at it I've opened

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,199
it here and I really

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,820
when put myself in the in the position

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,860
of someone who has not a lot of

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,199
experience with Jupiter or with Python

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,889
in general first thing I do I imported

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,570
see dust then then pixie dust provide

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:57,240
you with a bunch of sample data you can

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,580
play with and a simple API sample data

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,880
you get already a bunch of data that are

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,220
quite representative of of multiple use

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,350
cases in this case I'm not sure instead

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,690
into the million dollar home so I'm

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,880
going to say pixie dust sample data and

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,919
I'm gonna give not number six which is

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,370
here and it's going to create for me a

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,440
data frame now if I adds part which I

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,090
happen to be in data science experience

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,580
we are connected to spark is going to

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,370
create for me a spark data frame if I am

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,289
on pandas on the plane Python is going

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,600
to create for me attendance data frame

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:33,389
so you see here it's creating a sprog

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,210
data frame you can see the actual jobs

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:39,240
going through to the cluster and boom I

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,039
have a PI spark data frame but then I

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,320
want to visualize my data I know nothing

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,180
about this data and that's where pixie

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,880
does provide you with a simple API call

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,370
display I call this play on on the

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,169
actual variable called home when I do

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:57,210
that it will create a chrome you can see

00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,949
here with menus and it will

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,530
automatically detect it say okay I've

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,800
seen what what you have able to read the

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,979
actual schema I can go and change the

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,360
actual what what columns I want to see

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,669
now there's a lot of options

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm not going to go through this I even

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,349
have multiple render right there on the

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,090
side if I like my plot clip I can go to

00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,960
my closely bouquet is more interactive

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:24,570
now allow me to zoom in and zoom out but

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,210
if I want matplotlib I can just go there

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,210
and I get a matte flat layer that can't

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,860
even cluster by I can do all kinds of

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,930
cool things just by clicking around

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,430
which is great when you want to explore

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,770
all you want to do it explore your data

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,229
you know nothing about it you don't want

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:43,289
to spend too much time fiddling with

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,560
with code I can also see a a plain

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,120
rendering table of my of my data which

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,829
which is right there I can see the

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,500
actual data since I'm displaying homes

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:57,560
it has geo localized

00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,700
and I can even do a map rendering here

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,780
I'm using a renderer called my map box

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:07,520
and you've got is going to show me the

00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:10,010
actual view of all my data into a map I

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,600
have lots of options as well here but if

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,930
I'm not happy with my box I can go to

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,170
google to google map and it's extensible

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:22,550
so you can go ahead and even build your

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,800
own visualization so that's a - very

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,510
basically about what pixie dust is it

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,090
has tons of options I'm not gonna have

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,920
time to go through it but what I wanted

00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,710
to do today as well is give you a little

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,960
sneak preview of what we have been

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,870
recently adding to Pixy dust which is

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,780
the ability to strain to handle

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,150
streaming data coming from a cat car

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,570
from a spark streaming even from a REST

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,670
API

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,860
in this particular case I don't know if

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,520
you guys know dear the famous wonder

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,860
rendering drone it's a it's a fake drone

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,700
going over the planet and here we pixie

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,400
dust there very little code I'm able to

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,190
adapt create an adapter swimming adapter

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,650
to this particular REST API and display

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,390
it on a map so I'm not gonna go through

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,570
the code but it's very little though all

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:15,620
those images here are Mudbox related

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,840
things and you can see here the actual

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,640
drone moving over it's very fast but

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,380
it's fake and you can see I can zoom in

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,650
and I can see the why it's good pretty

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,630
fast I can keep up but that's one thing

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,100
that I wanted to show you it's it's

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,040
really interesting you can adapt this to

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,990
IBM streams to all kinds of streaming

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,990
data that you want rest based or not

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:46,340
okay so now I go back to my slide and

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:48,740
what I wanted to talk about next is so

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:52,130
this is the demo photo rendering drone

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:57,200
is Pixy apps if you guys are developers

00:10:52,130 --> 00:11:00,740
and wants to build applications that you

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,600
can you can communicate to line of

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,220
business users that's where pixie has

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:09,060
come in usually a developer would leave

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,709
his own world no js' Java and then you

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,040
have this line of communication that is

00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:17,310
very friction with pixee apps you are

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,100
able to build very very compelling

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,339
application and dashboard directly into

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,800
the notebook it's at its core it's

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:29,279
Python classes so you can package them

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,360
into a pie pie and and ship them off and

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,790
it allows you to to have a very cool way

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,990
of composing dashboard based on the

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,550
actual pixels display that you have

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,829
let's look at a quick example people

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,930
like maybe like code here this is a

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:51,720
complete pixie app that has one view

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:56,399
here I specify the entity that I want to

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,920
connect the target the actual options

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,459
and those options comes from the pixie

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,129
does display a placeholder where I'm

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:09,899
going to put the information and then I

00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:15,379
call run I call run on holes so now if I

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,379
wanted to show you let me go back here

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:23,990
[Music]

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,000
clear this this is my pixie app and you

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,950
see here I'm gonna run it directly so

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,610
what I'm going to do here is a very

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,730
basic application where I'm going to

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,530
build a very simple dashboard and it's

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,750
it's it's HTML I have complete

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,550
flexibility about what I can build right

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,500
you know HTML you can build as fancy as

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,680
you want and and print which is going to

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,990
show you a complete pixie app in the

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,150
what's on health field so when I run it

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,160
you see here it's it's creating me the

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,070
button that I have which I only have one

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,750
button right here but I provided a bunch

00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:05,480
of options here to tell to tell the the

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:11,000
pixie app how to render it when I click

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:13,490
on this it will automatically call the

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,040
pixie girls display and show me the

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:20,180
actual bar chart that I showed you

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,370
before if I wanted to bring in the the

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,330
map that I showed you before all I had

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:31,100
to do was copy and paste this piece of

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:34,339
code add a little divider

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,330
I need different options I'm going to

00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,380
call that map

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:41,480
I need different options I want the

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,770
option from the from this guy so I'm

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:49,490
gonna call view edit metadata that's

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:53,200
where the options are so I go here I

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:57,920
call edit metadata I copy this piece

00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:04,760
that is generated for me I put it back

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:07,519
into my pixie app in the options okay

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,230
and you see it's very iterative I don't

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,290
have to recompile or to do anything and

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,540
so should we run and now I have two

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:19,010
buttons I have a bar chart and a map

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:22,519
when I click on the map and I get the

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,110
map and now I have a functional

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,910
dashboard where I can click on the bar

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,170
chart back and you will go back to the

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:32,300
to the bar chart so this is really cool

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,120
to be able to build very very it has

00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,120
more feature that I I don't have time to

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,889
go over but it have advanced bus to pass

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:45,410
events between widgets it has a lot of

00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,209
functionality that allow you to to

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:55,699
change multiple widgets at the same

00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:57,110
times and so on and so forth so if you

00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,820
want to learn more we have a complete

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,410
documentation in the website it's all

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,610
open source you can build your own pixie

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,060
app in about 5 minutes

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:09,920
and the documentation is right there I'm

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,839
watching the time so now I'm gonna give

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,199
it over to pretty wish who's going to

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,870
show you inside Factory and also a good

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,529
surprise a a demo a complete demo of a

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,269
pixie app running into the Watson health

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:26,329
cluster thank you David

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,980
so just playing the person else here I'm

00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:31,339
a data scientist right now and as we

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,470
were saying we want to support Jupiter

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:35,600
through all these different personas so

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,480
as a data scientist one of the crucial

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,819
tasks that I do almost every day is kind

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,100
of repeatable I look at the data I try

00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:45,230
to clean the data I try to do feature

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,380
engineering and all of these workflows

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,500
can almost be encoded in a repeatable

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,199
patterns and what insight factory our

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,779
next productivity extension does is it

00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,470
tries to help our data scientists with

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:03,170
that process by providing you with a

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:06,199
predefined workflow that you can use at

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:09,760
your own leisure to build stuff much

00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:12,500
more quicker than you would do normally

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,569
now one of the key things and here again

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,339
I'm going to focus more on the demo not

00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:19,399
too much on the slides here because I

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:21,470
show you the cool stuff but at it is

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,860
very cold inside factory provides you

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,529
with repeatable snippets of code and we

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,999
argue that is much more usable than

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,970
packaging it in library format because

00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:34,639
that's much more restrictive and I will

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,009
also show you how it can help a user to

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,990
quickly generate their own workflows

00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:43,579
that can be used across the enterprise

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,980
so inside Factory as you can see and I

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:47,660
will show you the exact demo basically

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,490
it's a workflow that you see on the

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,699
right it's a stupid extension it

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:57,589
provides you with a menu tree based menu

00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:59,600
and by this extension Enterprise has set

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,129
here like the key steps that a data

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,990
scientist would go through to achieve

00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,029
their everyday tasks starting from

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,939
environment initialization all the way

00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:10,250
to predictive modeling it also has a

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:13,459
certain some other features so for

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,860
example what does it do apart from a

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,010
workflow so in an enterprise setting

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,559
when you are doing everyday tasks over

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,899
and over again there is a huge amount of

00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,589
need to have a standardization across

00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:30,470
the enterprise across users to use the

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,690
correct good practices so that is one of

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,419
the key things the second thing is as a

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,279
user I can also have certain snippets of

00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,350
code that I want to reuse over and over

00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,450
again for myself that's where you get

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,419
the user defined and I will show that in

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,520
the demo and if required you can share

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,529
it across the enterprise where admins

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,010
can look over it and make it part of the

00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:54,770
workflow so that's at a very basic level

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:58,010
and an high level what inside Factory

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,919
does but as its as always some people

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,470
say you know a demo is the best use case

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,929
to see how it's done so what we are

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:15,049
doing here today is we are going to show

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:16,429
you yeah so we are going to show you a

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:19,149
little

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,149
seem to write down

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,610
so today what we are going to show you

00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,980
is inside factories there I'm going to

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,070
show you the use of inside Factory by

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,129
integrating that with pixie dust and I

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,809
will show you in a simple example so I'm

00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:41,009
from Watson health and the example I'm

00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:43,950
going to give you is from a health

00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:46,710
domain so the what we are going to do

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,029
today is build a dashboard I am a data

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,120
scientist I am building that dashboard

00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:53,850
using the tools David provided and the

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,039
problem I'm going to analyze is I want

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,320
to look at patient set of patients who

00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,929
have a particular disease and then I

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,970
want to predict when different people

00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:04,470
would have that disease so we are going

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,830
to look at the particular disease

00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,679
diabetes for this case now we are going

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,659
to go through a number of like data

00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,360
intensive tasks so I also have another

00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:19,499
notebook open which is just to show you

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:23,190
the exact workflow like the outputs of

00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:26,429
it but at the very very simple case what

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,139
you see here as a data scientist I have

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,629
created the steps I have created my own

00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:33,090
user-defined workflow and this workflow

00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:35,159
is visual cohort analysis I start with

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,279
initializing the environment where I'm

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,529
importing in pixie-dust setting up all

00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,200
the pandas and SK learn things which we

00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:47,669
are using for our like own predictive

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:53,610
modeling we can also just go to the

00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:56,249
listing yeah so I'm just gonna show you

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,080
the outputs from the lab notebook that

00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:01,230
we have already populated just so that

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,509
in terms of interest of time so the

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,759
first step is initializing the app the

00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:08,490
second step is actually loading the data

00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,679
and we are going to look at three facets

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,809
of a patient's history we are going to

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,889
look at the demographic information we

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:15,360
are also going to look at their

00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:17,129
diagnosis information because there's

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,080
only way we can know whether that

00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:21,869
patient has is diagnosed with a disease

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,999
under interest with such as diabetes and

00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:26,940
we are also going to look at the

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:29,399
laboratory observations by which we can

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,519
categorize a patient's medical state and

00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:36,320
these all we will use at the end for our

00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,570
own predictive analysis so

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,300
and just switching back to the

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,640
pre-populated notebook here when you run

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,470
this at the very basic using that

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,990
workflow we are getting all that data in

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,850
together so the next step in the process

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,660
is actually creating what we called a

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,310
cohort class and again this is again

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,340
building on the simple concept of

00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,440
modularity where we are putting all this

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,410
data in and associating that with

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,410
patients in a way that is digestible to

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,780
the other steps in the process so when

00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:11,000
you run this you just get some feedback

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,830
that these are your interesting the

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,890
diagnosis enlisting the demographics and

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,510
so on going to the more cool stuff I

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,420
want to look at the descriptive

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:23,120
statistics and so again as you can see

00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,520
the whole idea of insight Factory is I

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,590
have committed all this workflows on

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,510
each of these steps I can just hover

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:33,590
around and I can insert the code to the

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:35,990
cell I can also preview the code in this

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,970
little cell itself and as you can see in

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,340
this workflow I have made it a little

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,580
variable specific so it can all be

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,440
extensible when we are doing it so the

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,530
disease that we are going to investigate

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,020
today is diabetes and the again the ID

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:53,330
for that is one so when you run this

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,980
step what does get demographics function

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,630
does and I'm going to show you later

00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,580
in a complete dashboard it's going to

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,820
collect all those data together

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,790
normalize it and do correlation analysis

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,010
with actual diseases so that we now have

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,830
complete information for patients who

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,360
have diabetes we have their complete

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,330
demographics observations and diagnosis

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,920
information again for the patients who

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,750
didn't have that disease we have the

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,940
similar information so you're just

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,010
preparing our data towards a final goal

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,850
which is predicting whether a patient

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,860
would have diabetes or not and then

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,170
going to the kind of the last step in

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,990
our data science workflow I want to

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,690
create this classification models again

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,300
you have this workflow define here I

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,509
have this little bit of code so that I

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,940
can do and it in

00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:47,759
the port cell as you see so it inserts

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,619
the code cell on the the cell just below

00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,979
the one that you are hovering kind of

00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:56,070
following the same jupiter insert idiom

00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:59,269
and when you do this and you run this

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,099
you get all this set of features and

00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:03,629
that's it for me as a data scientist i

00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:06,479
want to look at these features i want to

00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:10,889
look at their actual classification

00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:15,509
reports which again here we can use the

00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:19,019
pixie app framework which is to let me

00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:21,509
go to the last cell here so we can go to

00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,479
the pixie a framework where we can use

00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:26,249
this display function and here again we

00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:29,009
can fill in the variable that we want to

00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:30,659
display again i'm still now in the

00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:34,109
person now for data scientists this is

00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:36,029
purely for my kind of developer purpose

00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:39,029
this is my regular workflow for every

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:43,049
day and here i can go and when i put the

00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:45,989
like so this variable feech feet DF here

00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:48,179
i was passing the future importance for

00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:50,849
doing this creative analysis i can pause

00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,519
this in i have configured the jupiter

00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,169
the pixi app here pixie dust display

00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,859
here to show me a horizontal bar chart

00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:59,999
and it's just showing you the list of

00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:02,459
feature that we were investigating

00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:04,589
starting from weight to ethnicity and

00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:07,829
each size of the bar kind of indicates

00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:11,309
how important they are now I can change

00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:20,699
this to other variables I want I can use

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:26,369
it to show the report and again I can

00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:28,799
choose here just to show you just the

00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,569
data frame here which is again this is

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,279
the confusion matrix for people who were

00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:35,940
more comfortable with the classification

00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,859
analysis domain the within my data

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,159
scientist persona I can slice and dice

00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:44,009
the data together what we have done now

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,319
I have done all of these things again I

00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:47,789
want to show it to my business analyst

00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,539
and I want to create a dashboard for

00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,690
this now the data again the data is we

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,210
are

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,190
going to publish this app David can talk

00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,039
about that later but essentially we

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,509
showing you the methods that David

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,620
showed we built a little app called

00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:07,559
pixie help app and again following the

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:11,850
inside factories flow we have one step

00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:13,759
to insert the standalone app and again

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,740
this little question mark is for the

00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,690
variables that you want to fill in and

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,259
going back to the pre-populated cell

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,789
I have already filled in the stakes by

00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,830
the way the stakes in the variable

00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:28,019
cohort which we started at the very

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,870
beginning where all this information is

00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,809
being like pulled in and I can go in and

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,639
I can run this and that brings you to

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:38,039
this dashboard that we have designed and

00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:40,529
keep in mind this is again for a final

00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,419
end user a business analyst who doesn't

00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:43,710
want to go into the exact process I go

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,870
through what they're more interested in

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,379
this actual problem who are these people

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,149
who have this disease diabetes and can

00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:52,019
you predict them and they also want to

00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,500
interact with it

00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:58,080
so our first screen here is the disease

00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,549
selection we are going to so you can

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,620
select here between different diseases

00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:05,009
today we are going to show you the demo

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,200
on diabetes so when you click on that

00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:10,440
again at the back end again this is a

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,490
standalone dashboard so whatever step

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,379
that I showed you earlier

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:16,379
getting the demographic information and

00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:18,779
so on it's doing that back end here and

00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:23,539
it's going to show you in a second

00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:26,340
what that data looks like now again

00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:27,809
things that a person may be interested

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,059
in so I talked to you about the

00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:31,620
demographic information so one of the

00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,799
things that shows you is the age

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,139
distribution it also shows you the hba1c

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,509
which is the blood sugar level and for

00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:41,820
diseases like diabetes that's very

00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:45,059
important you all another very important

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,210
criteria is BMI index and so here we are

00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,980
showing you a scatter chart of these two

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:52,879
variables similarly if you have

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,350
distributions by gender by race and

00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:58,080
again this is all extensible a person

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,059
can come in and and other things keep in

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,279
mind this is just a demo so we have

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,280
created these full displays and the

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,160
analyst is looking at

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,860
it and trying to gain insights about the

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,690
data that the person is dealing with now

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,000
going to the cool stuff which is the

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,520
actual predictive analysis you can see

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,890
this is like pretty fast so we have a

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,290
couple of things in here so the first

00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:24,270
screen here shows you the features that

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:29,260
the app analyzes so it looks at hba1c

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:33,640
height weight gender BMI race etcetera

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:36,340
etc so that's the first part at the end

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,290
of the reports again so this is based on

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,070
the data science data scientists input

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:44,470
what they want to see so you have the

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:47,380
tables the classification reports you

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,540
have the ROC curves I'm not going to go

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,760
into details of ROC curves but at the

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,110
very basic the blue line it should be

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,060
much higher than the red line which is

00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,280
like the baseline and this is just a

00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,880
random guess and it should be as high as

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,980
possible this is being done on very

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,230
similar to data so that's why and then

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,080
the behind we are running random forest

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,740
classifier from Ascalon just for a basic

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:16,450
input and on the last screen you see the

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,640
feature importance again the same thing

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,500
that we and looked at as the data

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,020
scientist we are just providing that to

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,410
a final business user the business user

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:29,980
also may want to look at particular

00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:32,470
features in absence of other features so

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,120
we call this abolition test we want to

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,370
look at how does the classification

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,580
report changes if let's say we drop

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:42,280
height from our analysis so let's drop

00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,960
height here we can let's say drop weight

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,190
here because both of this information

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:52,690
are potentially encoded in the BMI and

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:56,080
here we can let's keep age you can

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,460
update the model again see this is the

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,560
power of the dashboards using the

00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,930
insight factory that they have done it

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,940
on the runtime it updates the

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,380
classification model so now it shows you

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,960
an updated

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,090
classification report we looks like we

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,940
have had a like a minor bump in

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:15,540
classification accuracy and you can also

00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,110
see the feature importance and now the

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,450
importance of

00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,210
the features that we want or we think

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:25,629
are more important hba1c BMI are much

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:30,399
higher than previously before so very

00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:33,850
basic demo and again I'm just going to

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,340
close this as I was saying the whole

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,889
point was I have the data scientist I

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,889
went through the first initial seven

00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:44,080
steps I for my business user I created

00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:47,049
the standalone app and I put that as my

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,330
own user-defined workflow and think of

00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,399
it now let's say your other colleague in

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,470
the data science data scientist wants to

00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:55,749
create the same thing you can make this

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,309
report kind of shareable across the

00:29:55,749 --> 00:30:33,340
enterprise and they already have a

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:35,859
template of creating so that's a yeah so

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,159
basically it's a very good demonstration

00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:40,929
of how the developer the data scientist

00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,509
and ruler and business users are

00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:46,480
collaborating together within one to

00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:48,639
within the notebook things that they

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,129
would have had to do separate tools with

00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:53,769
a friction that you know here they can

00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:56,399
collaborate iterate over and over again

00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:59,769
all within a notebook which is fantastic

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,769
by the way this application is open

00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:05,169
source and it's on github come to see us

00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:06,549
afterwards I will give you the URL if

00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,980
you are interested to Bill depicts the

00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:11,470
app and you want to see a more robust

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,629
and MIDI pixi app you can I'll

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,119
definitely look at this app we have

00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:19,600
other apps one that analyzed Twitter

00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:22,029
sentiment we have streaming data we have

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,350
weather day weather data lots of pixie

00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:25,690
app samples that you can use as a

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,170
reference for you if you decide to go

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,810
and start building so those

00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:35,290
yep so going back to the presentation

00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:43,490
and getting my glasses sorry

00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:44,660
getting old really what we want to show

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,650
here that's what's next

00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,720
you've seen those great demo but a lot

00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,310
of people come to see me and say those

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,320
are great things and I can build them

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,840
very quickly within a within a notebook

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,450
but really I would love them to be

00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,010
running into a web app I don't want to

00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,660
force my line of business users to go

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,580
into a notebook

00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,170
some people might be ok with it some

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,370
people might say I really want to build

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,930
into a web app and that's what we were

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:13,220
working on now for pixie-dust

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:16,310
the ability to publish this web app that

00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:19,370
you just saw with no code change into

00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:22,940
into a web application you'll be able to

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,800
grab some code embeddable code and put

00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,380
it into your website into a div and then

00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,020
all those graphics will come to life

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,430
into your website that's what we're

00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,900
excited about because we think that

00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:38,300
we've done 90% of the of the end-to-end

00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,950
with using notebooks to do to the max we

00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,870
are really leveraging all the features

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,240
that it has but at the end of the day

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,400
what you really want is publish it into

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,880
your web app we are also working on

00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,610
visualization enhancements adding color

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,350
customization geo zgo Jason layers

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:57,470
format streaming data I talked about

00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,660
that sorting filtering we also looking

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,090
for volunteers to help us build new

00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,010
visualization all the things that have

00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,260
shown you before they're extensible

00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,630
there's api's you can go and build your

00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,730
own you can inject your own menu if you

00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,920
have a cool visualization that you would

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,380
like to promote and you don't want

00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,750
people to you want to ease people into

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,340
using your stuff without really writing

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,590
code you can build your own

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,180
visualization directly to pixie-dust all

00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,280
they would have to do is import your

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,740
package and there's a machinery to

00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,980
inject it right away we also want to use

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,080
build templates with pre-built things so

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,780
that people who don't know HTML they'll

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,640
be able to directly write a Pixy app

00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,790
with the pre-built templates and that's

00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,059
gonna even

00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:44,940
make it faster and easier to build to

00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:48,840
build pixi app with the same saying a

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,640
team so that's something we are we are

00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,820
working on and we are welcoming and a

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,370
feedback there also the ability to run

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,170
nodejs that's something we we we feel

00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:00,240
passionate about there is a there's a

00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:02,460
thousands in millions of people

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,410
comfortable with node and we already

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,950
have a prototype out there that allow

00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,869
you to write nodejs directly into and to

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,470
pixie dust and and get the visualization

00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:17,030
right there and finally we would love to

00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:21,929
to support you bit of lab in the future

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:23,820
conclusion what you know data data

00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,580
science is a team sport it's not only

00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,460
for for data scientists and that's what

00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:32,970
I hope we compared today as a message

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,200
here's a bunch of resources that you can

00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,230
go to

00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,659
there's tons of blog post out there and

00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:43,619
you can go and connect with me directly

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:47,570
on Twitter or medium and we'll be happy

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:50,970
to to talk to you we can also go to our

00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:53,520
IBM booth and I'll be there a couple of

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,590
hours today and tomorrow and we can talk

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,450
more about about pixie dust there is

00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:00,450
another session on pixie dust tonight at

00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:05,130
4 o'clock which will focus I believe on

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:06,840
geo localization geo-mapping so I really

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,670
wanted to get gear get some time for

00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,130
questions we have five minutes if there

00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,290
is any questions I'm going to stop

00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,430
talking now and let you see if there's

00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,430
any questions any questions

00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:47,580
yes yes that's the inside factory their

00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:49,830
plans probably at some point right right

00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:54,150
now it's not but one of the things that

00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:55,830
you you in an enterprise setting right

00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,000
so if there are multiple other

00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,260
scientists they can use that to

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,600
collaborate so for example they can

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,510
create a very cool coat zipper to do

00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,010
certain functionality and put that in

00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:14,330
and then the others can actually use

00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:14,330
that and you know question yep

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:26,940
yes yes yes that's a great questions and

00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,370
I may have given you the answer at some

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,670
point during my my demo what pixie-dust

00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:36,030
does it remembers your settings and put

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:38,130
that into the cell metadata so even

00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,080
though the code is exactly the same the

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,870
cell metadata is not and picks it up

00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,390
feeds off this when you start fresh it

00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:48,420
will go to the default visualization but

00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,100
once you start configuring it and doing

00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,900
things it will remember you don't have

00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:56,450
to do it again so that's why you have

00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,450
the same code doing different results

00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,750
yeah

00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,980
yeah so that's a quick question we

00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:21,530
started to think about this with the

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:25,130
upcoming features of the ability to

00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:27,620
publish you'll be able to really publish

00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,770
those as widgets and consume them into a

00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:34,670
tableau or lucre or Cognos things that's

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:37,220
one possibilities the reverse could be

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,340
this could be also explored but at the

00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:45,080
moment my thinking is let's let's use

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:47,150
pixels to to build those assets it could

00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,220
be a simple graph it could be could be a

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,840
drill down of multiple widget

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,260
communicating with each other and have

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,960
them surface into into tableau or lucre

00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,210
or something like that of course you can

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:27,500
always do that into your own HTML page

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:40,940
it's like one point you could actually

00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:43,940
just within the cognizant wants to push

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:47,350
out for example in a report or further

00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,350
analysis to the DM scientist
