	00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:09,510
in my keynote this morning I spoke about

00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:11,129
sustainability and the the topic of not

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,990
just sustaining the people who are

00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,940
working on maintaining the software but

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,210
actually sustaining the innovation

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,000
spirit within an open-source ecosystem

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,700
and and specifically around the idea of

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,010
there being a value network between the

00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,080
creators and consumers of technology in

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,800
these ecosystems so this talk I'm going

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,079
to delve bit deeper into the challenges

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,070
that we faced in doing that and and you

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,379
know look at kind of what we do a

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,969
continuum with anaconda and how that

00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:41,370
models worked out and then I'll talk

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,309
about sort of the how I think about the

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,260
open source world and specifically you

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,359
know in our PI data Python sort of space

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,059
and provide ideas for how we can reason

00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,920
about how you know as the world changes

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,530
how do we actually keep this up how do

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,769
we hold on to what we've created and

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,420
taking it further so I want to start by

00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,110
just highlighting everyone that actually

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,000
the nature of software itself is

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:10,049
changing and I've been doing I've been

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,460
coding for about 30 years now and I've

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,590
watched it change quite a lot in that

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,890
time certainly businesses have changed

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,320
in that time but right now we are really

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,299
in a transitional space really a very

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,610
interesting transformational period in

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,030
software and many of you and the

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,320
audience

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,789
you know may be encoding longer than me

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,280
some of you may be coding less than me

00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:30,479
but I think everyone can sort of see

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,000
that you know things are different now

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,799
right you you look back 10 years ago

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,969
maybe and you're not talking about all

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,640
this sort of stuff you were maybe

00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,829
talking about a language or a framework

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,149
and and some things were changing you

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,159
know people I talk about oh this is a

00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:45,450
software the service approach over here

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,289
we're gonna try to do some functional

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,210
approach but now we have this massive

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:54,329
disruption in all of the things that

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,810
underlie what software itself does and

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,520
so to be a software developer to be you

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,170
know actually wear the hat and say yes

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,310
I'm a software developer in this day and

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,409
age you have to know about a wide

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,630
variety of things that are all really

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,220
changing how we think about how we write

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,959
software how we tested how we deploy it

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,700
how we manage it how we maintain it all

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,650
these different things are changing

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,819
around us and sometimes you look at the

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,620
stuff and you're like you know

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,269
can't handle it cuz I just want to sit

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,040
in an editor and code and be done I

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,549
don't want to learn JavaScript stuff

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,590
over here

00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,700
I don't alert VM stuff over here I don't

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,219
wanna learn ocher station frameworks

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,889
over there I just want a code right but

00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,639
but software is changing because

00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,319
software itself has always been a

00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:37,709
transitional thing right it's between

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,919
hardware and the ultimate end business

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:43,769
problem so software exists because it

00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,239
can change faster it can be molded more

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,650
easily than making new ASIC chips and so

00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,849
so that's that's kind of the thing that

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,079
we're faced with the software developers

00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,980
we've kind of lived in this rarefied

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:58,919
space and so as business problems though

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,709
become as they become more and more data

00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,439
driven the nature of how we do software

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,579
also has to change and that's at the

00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,019
same time that all of these

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,349
infrastructure things are changing all

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,549
these VMs and and and OS is and all

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,840
these different platforms and all these

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,540
infrastructure things are changing

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,459
underneath us at the upper end what our

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,060
software supposed to do is also changing

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,909
and so one thing that's that sort of is

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,609
a corollary to this is that we actually

00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,689
have to think as software itself changes

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,000
as the nature of what software is

00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,470
changes the nature of what it means to

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,259
be a software business also must

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,250
necessarily change and so you know you

00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,799
see a lot of infrastructure things

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,120
moving to the cloud it's some of it's

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,889
moving faster than we think others will

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,769
take a longer time you know a lot of

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,019
core business concerns they are really

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,819
around data right and so even if you

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,169
move those things in the cloud you're

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,669
still worried about those same data

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:53,489
concerns just on someone else's computer

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,349
and likewise development now involves

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,040
orchestration and provisioning all these

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,599
things and that you know you can do in

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,430
the cloud and it's maybe faster than

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,840
getting something approved by IT but it

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,280
doesn't change the inherent complexity

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,689
in trying to build a distributed system

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,340
that complexity is still there whether

00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,709
it's on someone else's computer or on

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,090
your own computer and so you know a lot

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,609
of the core challenges were facing a

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,139
software deaths there even if we move to

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:17,609
cloud they're not necessarily solved by

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,120
them write the data concerns are not

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,639
solved by nearly going to cloud so so

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,650
the the all of the technical and the

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,639
business concerns around software

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,250
they're really here to stay

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,080
and

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,380
one thing that's been interesting to

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,450
watch is actually how open source and

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,130
the conversation the developer

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,280
conversation at open source has evolved

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,980
that back in the day when we were first

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,570
talking about open source and and the

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,520
stuff really started merging people

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,170
focused a lot on licenses and what are

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,580
the rights guaranteed to me by these

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,500
licenses and this license versus that

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,120
license and nowadays if you go around at

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,410
conferences there's you know some kind

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,090
of turf wars between these things but

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,770
that issue is is not nearly as as large

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,840
does not loom nearly as large because

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,670
people actually understand that it's

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,200
really open source is about creating

00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,780
communities of developers it's about

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,360
actually empowering people to create new

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,100
things and to work together and what's

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,570
interesting is because people are free

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,030
to innovate and they're free to create

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,860
it actually helps the creators

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,620
technology and the consumers technology

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,060
align more much more rapidly so that's a

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,010
great thing and then you know the famous

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,500
quote from Marc Andreessen that software

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,310
is eating the world if you look around

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,260
and I don't how many of you are

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,570
developers in a business or enterprise

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,800
context but it's clear that in the last

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,540
15 years there's been a massive

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,720
transition at this point in time

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,760
open-source is not some weird odd like

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,770
kumbaya hippies around a tree kind of

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,770
like weird stuff open-source a standard

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,770
how you do stuff right and and so that

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,090
that nature the changing nature of

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,919
software development open-source is

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,060
start to become the core of it and if

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,770
and that's just the developer

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,360
conversation or open source if you look

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,190
at the business conversation on open

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,320
source businesses are actually getting

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,660
more savvy as well and you know I

00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,160
remember in the day Microsoft when Linux

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,720
was first starting to threaten the

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,370
window's hegemony I guess the the

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
argument Microsoft always make is well

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,740
it's not really free because you have to

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,380
look at the total cost of ownership

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,270
right TCO TCO was their big argument and

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,980
it's true it's a valid argument but

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,240
businesses now are aware of that

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,740
argument and they're still moving

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,480
forward with open-source because for

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,370
them it is not about the cost of the

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,900
software nor is it even about the

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,910
maintenance cost that software it's

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,730
actually cheaper in many cases to to

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,130
have open source but actually the core

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,870
business concerns that businesses are

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,270
looking to open source for based on my

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,700
you know my experiences are they want a

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,639
void vendor lock-in and they also want a

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,289
hardest innovation

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,210
they want to be tied to where the puck

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:50,129
is going if you only buy vendor you know

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,930
developed in an opaque black box kind of

00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:55,229
thing you're just getting where the

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,120
vendor says the puck was if you're an

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,560
open source if you're a dev teams and if

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,939
you're technologists are actually

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,789
engaged and plugged into the open-source

00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,259
innovation sphere they can actually see

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,729
where the puck is going and it may not

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,139
be exact exactly right but at least you

00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,689
have some level of visibility so

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,310
businesses you know people who are high

00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:12,509
up in management and management changes

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,580
and businesses when I talk to them

00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,529
nowadays they're aware of this right

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,050
they really like that open source

00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:20,610
actually ties you to innovation and of

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,469
course the vendor lock-in is something

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,360
that everyone is very very tired of and

00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:26,159
they know that if the stuff they're

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,250
relying on is in the open source at the

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,569
very least there's a floor to the to the

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,129
cost which is they need to hire some

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,770
full-time devs to help maintain the

00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,110
stuff on their own but they have they

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,000
have an alternative to just being roped

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,069
in looped into some vendors proprietary

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,960
stuff and so the businesses are getting

00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:44,669
savvy are about open source the open

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,939
source devs are also changing how they

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:49,199
think about open source and and in the

00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,330
middle of this change and in the middle

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,529
of open source getting more more popular

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,449
we have another confounding factor

00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,909
that's happening which is that people

00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,460
are mistaking data science coding for

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:01,529
software development coding a lot of IT

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,270
folks just look at it as like oh this

00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:05,039
person is an Emacs they must be a dev

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,000
and it's like no this person has no idea

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,159
what they're doing in Emacs they were

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,449
told three combinations of codes so they

00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:13,979
could write a little python script and

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:15,149
be done right and so the idea that you

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,669
know this this is really problematic

00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,580
actually because data science is a newly

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,020
emergent field there's not a lot of like

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,699
in data science conferences and I would

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,250
say that Jupiter is is one such

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,240
conference people are still trying to

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,039
figure out which side is up right

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,960
there's a lot of a lot of newness and

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,190
this stuff and you can really see from a

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,199
distance it looks a little bit like

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,729
software development but the way I talk

00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:37,949
about is the data scientists tend to use

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,229
code the way that my daughter uses a

00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:41,699
hammer which is that it's surprisingly

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,979
effective she actually can get the nail

00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:45,690
in the wood and usually there's no blood

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,820
shed but it's not how you're gonna build

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,279
a house right so data scientists they

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,870
can definitely code some stuff but

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,310
they're not gonna build a large software

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,170
architecture and they're probably not

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,579
going to really

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,700
want to maintain any of it even if they

00:08:55,579 --> 00:09:00,139
could and so this conflation of data

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,329
sites with software development it's a

00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,930
common misperception and it's if for

00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:07,730
Python in particular it's a really it's

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,320
an unfortunate sort of like albatross

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,610
around the Python which is kind of a

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,760
funny image you think about an albatross

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,410
tied to a snake but but you know python

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
is really really misunderstood as a

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,070
language because it is applicable in so

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,389
many different fields if you're in the

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,029
computer graphics field do you think if

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:24,889
python is one of your workflow pipeline

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,440
you know orchestration tools if maybe

00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:29,300
also a an embedded scripting engine

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,709
inside your 3d rendering system if

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,240
you're in the data science world of

00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:36,139
course python is one of the standard go

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,329
to tools if you're in in system

00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,639
administration and an IT python is a

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,740
replacement for bash right in every

00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,240
different area you go to you can see

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,740
python being used in different ways and

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,410
so everyone's seeing a different part of

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,880
this elephant so so it really and and

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,010
the other thing is most languages don't

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,480
have this characteristic right Lua has a

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,070
nice embedded language you're not going

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,110
to go and build Instagram with Lua

00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,029
right you can go and build nice things

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,920
web apps in Ruby and Ruby on Rails

00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,600
you're not gonna go and use Ruby to go

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,550
and crunch a bunch of matrices on a

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,640
supercomputer and so most other

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:10,010
languages don't have this kind of

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,300
polyglot nature Python does and that

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,500
also means that it gets misunderstood

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,779
quite a bit it tends to get pigeonholed

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,610
then by businesses right depending on

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,350
who's talking about the language they're

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,850
gonna see it in one particular

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,560
pigeonhole and they're gonna not really

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,100
understand how to manage this broad

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,519
polyglot applicability of the language

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,829
and so into all of this confusion and

00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,720
all this transformation as software

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:34,399
itself is changing as the attitudes

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,680
about open source are becoming severe

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,430
and changing as data science is emerging

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,660
into all of this Travis and I stepped

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,660
right in and we created a new company

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,649
called continuum analytics and we wanted

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,269
to see if we could build a different

00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,589
kind of open source company we thought

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,240
that the moment was right there was a

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:51,920
lot of great opportunities to see if we

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,440
couldn't build technology keep it open

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,389
at the same time build useful products

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,709
and services for our customers and so

00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,850
really brief history of continuum is

00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:03,170
that we started really by bootstrapping

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,000
with consulting and with some government

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,550
grants and training services things like

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,070
that and that really helped get us off

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,990
the ground

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,090
let us you know it enabled us to build

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,060
some early technologies and also build

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,470
some some early products and and we sold

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,510
these products we had a you know we

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,060
still you know have a way that you can

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,740
go and buy these individual things but

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,020
we found that wasn't very lucrative it

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,570
certainly was not going to pay the bills

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,130
for what it cost to actually keep a

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,340
bunch of really talented dev stealing

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,590
art problems and at the same time we

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,040
thought that we would be lifted up by

00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,900
the winds of good fortune because Python

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,850
and PI data they're becoming much more

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,900
popular and much more adopted in

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,750
business in the industry

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,960
o hugely popular right in big data data

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:52,110
engineering data science and one thing

00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,870
that that we found is that actually even

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,640
when you're successful there's there are

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,590
problems that come with success right so

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,210
even if your technology is exactly right

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,220
and even if technology is incredibly

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,760
useful for business critical problems

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,850
you can have technology market fit and

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,350
not have product market fit and this is

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,880
actually in general a problem for any

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,130
company that's creating some new tech

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,230
you might find people that want to adopt

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,450
your tech especially if they're early

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,910
adopters right but early adopters are

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,980
always faced like you always face this

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,420
challenge of the buy versus build with

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,010
early adopters and with Python in

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,600
particular and specially here in New

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,100
York with all the finance and hedge

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,020
funds everything it's a huge problem

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,670
they know exactly how powerful the

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,830
technology is and they understand

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,620
exactly what they need from it and they

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,750
also have a very very low tolerance for

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,340
products that don't work and so you put

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,840
all these things together and you end up

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,400
with a situation where it's actually the

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,560
people who love your tech the most are

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,020
the ones so probably the worst people to

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,580
trial your products right and that's not

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,810
something that you necessarily get in a

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,030
lot of other situations if you're

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,860
building some new widget you know you're

00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,150
gonna go and research the tech based on

00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,980
the funding you raised you're gonna go

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,960
and build the widget around the tech

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,060
they're gonna go try to find somebody

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,710
who's willing to take an early version

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,150
of some widget that's got some amazing

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,030
tech very very straightforward and

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,190
linear with open source people can do an

00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,840
end run around the products trying to

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,550
build and simply adopt and build

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,420
themselves so there's a lot of

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,220
interesting dynamics and and it's a

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,810
business problem that is it's hard to

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,750
articulate it takes a bit to articulate

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:27,690
but it also is not one that's trivial to

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,710
solve and so how do we but we have to

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,630
solve this problem if we want to

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,550
continue doing open source tech we can't

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,260
keep building tech that then cannibalize

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,080
this product right that's not gonna be a

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,580
good sustainable business model and so

00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,930
to address this problem I want to you

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,010
know tell one a favor statistical

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,080
stories and many of you may be familiar

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:47,390
with this but there's this really great

00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,529
anecdote about how World War two the the

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,029
the the British they were seeing these

00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,470
bombers coming back from bombing runs

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,890
and they would be riddled with holes

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,170
right and so you know when you build a

00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,250
bomber you want to reduce the weight of

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,140
the bomber because that means you have

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,210
more fuel you can go further you can put

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,430
more ordnance on it and so they were

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,320
looking at adding plate armor to the

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,420
Bombers they want to reinforce various

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,710
pieces and so you get these bombers back

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,270
you look at where the holes are and

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,380
certainly you're like well okay let's go

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,150
reinforce the places that have the most

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,740
holes and actually a really bright

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,060
mathematician statistician figured out

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,040
no no no you don't want to reinforce the

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,120
holes the place is what the most holes

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,410
are the places you don't need to

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,810
reinforce because the plane still came

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,790
back its the places that have no holes

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,589
is where you need to add the armor

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,150
because every plane that got a bullet

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,700
through that particular spot and never

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,410
made it back and so it's it's probably

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,850
one of the most beautiful intuitive and

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,610
counterintuitive examples of Bayesian

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,890
inference that that I've ever seen but

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,270
it's it's it's you know you think about

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,190
it for like another two seconds you're

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,290
like oh that makes total sense obviously

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,530
you reinforce the parts that you can't

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,820
have any holes in so it's a similar kind

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,920
of I tell the story because a similar

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,510
kind of thing around how we sort of got

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,850
our thinking around to the product

00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,370
development efforts for anaconda and for

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,460
for our overall activities a continuum

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,010
and we basically decide to build things

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,839
that the open source ecosystem is not

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,150
building right instead of going and

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,350
trying to innovate faster harder and do

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,209
more things in the space where people

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,550
are willing and interested to build

00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:16,410
stuff let's go and build the things that

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,640
people are not building either because

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,520
they don't know about the problems or

00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,560
they're just not interested in self

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,170
servicing on those problems and so

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,940
that's led to the growth of a suite of

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,550
offerings and capabilities in our

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,170
anaconda enterprise product before still

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,510
offer consulting services and training

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,560
support around all of these things and

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,800
we've actually through our technology

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,850
and our product build we've actually

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,470
established partnerships with lots of

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,010
you know big industry established

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,780
industry players and and it's actually

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,040
kind of a really it's a different way

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,630
than you think about it right like with

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,340
the first products we build like i/o Pro

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,870
it was like oh let's load your data

00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,100
faster because people love loading data

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,690
people do it all the time it's slow

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,700
let's go load the data faster with

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,410
number pro we're like oh well people run

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,940
their code it's slow they want to run it

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,080
faster I guess we're not that creative

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,120
or thinking I was just make everything

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,610
go faster but it turns out that going

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,690
faster is actually not necessarily the

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,830
problem people want to pay money for

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,240
right so another way that's not as

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,070
component oriented but that's more

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,200
capability oriented another way to look

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,630
at what we do is in our commercial

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,340
offerings is that you know we sort of we

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,340
target a number of different functional

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,960
areas or our capabilities that are

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,390
looking outside of just the data

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,940
scientists in a box we look at what does

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:38,180
the data scientist actually need to do

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,470
he or she has to consume artifacts from

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,730
other people in their organization and

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,380
they have to produce artifacts for other

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,610
people in the organization let's look at

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,380
all those other bridges they have to

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,520
build and figure out how we can build

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,640
those bridges for them and

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,950
operationalize those bridges and so the

00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,690
the whole suite of anaconda enterprise

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,160
users you know we don't build we build

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,200
anaconda for the data scientists we

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,850
build an economy prize for the team that

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,920
the data scientist finds themselves on

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,510
and so there's something in there for

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,300
everyone that is involved all the

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,360
stakeholders around the data side

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,160
operation and so that's that's really

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,140
how we've managed to do it thus far I

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,980
think that model will continue to work

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,780
for a while and and and so I don't

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,130
really see major differences in

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,320
divergences between us and what the

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:24,079
community needs on that side of things

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,060
but if we think about like the bigger

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,430
picture and all of the innovation that

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,510
happens as you guys look at the poster

00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,320
session or walk around looking at the

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,140
things that people are doing with

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,360
Jupiter there it's clear that this is

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,430
just unlocking the keys to a whole wide

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,450
jungle of cool stuff that people can do

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:43,970
and you know I think about the early

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,710
internet you know everyone could go and

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,930
get an account with an ISP they get an

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,070
FTP site they can go an FTP up some

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,660
files and index

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,640
EML and some other stuff and they have a

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,640
website and that worked for a number of

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,840
years but it was you know when geo

00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,880
cities that made that a little bit

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,370
easier or when wordpress came along as a

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,230
blogging platform that made it easy for

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,540
people to create content and share that

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,250
content that really democratized the

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,380
content creation on the web now while

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,060
that was good or bad you know remains to

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,440
be seen but nonetheless the point is

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,040
that it unlocked to create a potential

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,690
for everyone

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,570
I think Jupiter has a similar kind of

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,270
possibility that many many people many

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,050
more people in the world have

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,820
explorations they want to do in sites

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,630
they want to share then the people who

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,730
are able to do a actual data science you

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,770
know site build an actual data science

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,710
app right now so we're about to bridge

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,420
that gap with this technology and the

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,770
question I want people to be thinking

00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,000
about not just in this room and not just

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,300
in this conference but in the community

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,620
at large is when we bridge that gap what

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,600
problems are going to face how do we

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,340
ensure that what's brought us thus far

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,200
we don't lose that momentum and we don't

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:52,100
lose the core although it's valuable in

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:56,300
that and so I'd like to introduce a

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,970
metaphor that I use certainly to to

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,440
think about what is sustainable open

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,090
source what is a state what makes for

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,760
sustainable communities around open

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,470
source innovation and it's really about

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,550
gardening so that's the metaphor I want

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,320
to use now I don't know how people here

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:12,290
garden or enjoy gardening or know much

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,820
about it if you play farmville maybe you

00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,830
might think of gardening in this way as

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,190
you take inputs you transform them into

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,230
other sorts of outputs and and actually

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,150
honestly that's not too far from the

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,230
truth right real gardening does involve

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,690
a lot of moving these around

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,860
transforming things tending to things

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,620
there's daily maintenance you have to do

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,590
you don't grind things for XP and you

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,510
don't buy things in game currency but

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,220
otherwise real farming does involve a

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:41,150
lot of transformation and a lot of rote

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,680
tedious work and so I think that the

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,170
open source I like think of the open

00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,440
source innovation kind of ecosystem as a

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,940
community garden and oral community

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,900
orchard you know community farms

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,770
something like that a farming

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,720
cooperative and so we actually can see

00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,700
you know some open-source devs they sit

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,910
there to tend to their tree they water

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,570
it it grows up it bears some fruit and

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,580
and they just give the

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,809
away right and they might take the fruit

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,639
and they might set up a little fruit

00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:09,620
stand and put a little honour box there

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:13,880
you know patreon honor box give me some

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,159
money please and in the case of like GPG

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,350
or OpenSSL it was for deaths tending to

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,600
one small tree that everyone needed

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,580
right and the honor box was not getting

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,110
filled at all there's other folks are

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,610
gonna come by there to pick a bunch of

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,440
this fruit they're gonna package it up

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,600
in their own white label thing and go

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,309
sell it on market and the open-source

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,200
devs don't begrudge them those profits

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:35,330
usually those people go and do it and

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,279
oftentimes they'll do it without really

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,720
a care to think about where does this

00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,549
mana come from where do these fruits

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,519
come from right they'll just it's a sort

00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:45,799
of a drive-by export and people do that

00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,299
but there's still others so we're gonna

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,620
go and try to do something a little bit

00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,600
closer to the field they're gonna go set

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,549
up a little farm store or a little

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,690
orchard fruit stand that's actually man

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,809
that that actually has some level of

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,309
service and quality control and and of

00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:59,389
course with the proceeds they take some

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:00,500
of that and put that back into the

00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,299
maintenance and tending of the garden

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,639
but my point is that there's many

00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,559
different folks that are involved in

00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,570
this ecosystem the people who just do

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,950
the drive-by take the stuff go invent it

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,360
they actually serve a purpose as well

00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,919
they're helping to disseminate the

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,269
adoption and the popularity of the

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,580
particular fruits and vegetables from

00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:18,440
your farm across a wide variety of

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,850
locations that you know people might not

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,899
come to your garden or to your little

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:25,700
fruit orchard so all of us can benefit

00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:27,679
all of us do benefit you know and we all

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,179
work together this ecosystem and we have

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,889
to ask ourselves though how do we

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,240
sustain this thing right how do we make

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,960
sure this whole thing's to state stays

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,389
viable and and sustainability is not

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,980
just a process right it's actually an

00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:41,929
ecosystem characteristic it's not

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,230
something that only one of the players

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:47,570
does one one farmer by himself or

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,360
herself in this large farm garden

00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,250
environment cannot ensure sustainability

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,909
sustainability is an ethos that must

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:58,340
permeate that entire thing and so the

00:21:55,909 --> 00:22:02,750
way we do it though is we we we have to

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,850
not be blind or or ignore the entire

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,620
value chain entire cycle that were part

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,570
of so we have to actually think about

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,360
the full value chain all the way up to

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:14,840
the table of the consumer I live in

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,070
Austin it's a very lovely city and it's

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,989
very sustaining

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,549
oriented and very progressive in those

00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:21,649
kinds of ways so there's a huge

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,239
farm-to-table movement in Austin at the

00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:24,590
restaurants and at the grocery level and

00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:27,019
all these different things so the

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,999
farm-to-table aspect of this is what I

00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:31,460
like for us to contemplate as we do open

00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:33,259
source it's not enough just to say I am

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,090
an open source dev I really particularly

00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:37,070
love cultivating this particular kind of

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,600
heirloom tomato that's all I will do I

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,460
don't care who eats and how they eat it

00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,649
and what happens to it downstream if you

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,909
do that you're really putting yourselves

00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:46,190
at the you're putting yourself or

00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:47,960
yourselves at the mercy of these broader

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,929
things that happen around you you you

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,470
have to sort of take an active role in

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:55,340
contemplating the sustainability

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:57,200
ecosystem and likewise if you're one of

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,479
the vendors right I speak as someone

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,909
who's create a company that lives and

00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:04,129
breathes in this ecosystem we have to be

00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:06,619
very cognizant of the entire value chain

00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:08,419
and the entire health of that whole

00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,720
system and you know what's unfortunate

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,249
is that there's actually very few

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,499
there's very few historical examples

00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:17,299
that we can point to where open-source

00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:19,220
communities were able to sustainably

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,460
thrive based on a network of value

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,629
creation usually it's hierarchical or

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,820
usually there's a patronage of some

00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:27,440
wealthy donor that makes billions of

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,940
dollars a quarter and they just throw

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,799
some nickels at a couple of open source

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,499
tabs right and that's all great

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,299
but that's not sustainable and so the

00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:39,349
history of Technology though is very

00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:41,509
young and it's changing every few years

00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:43,070
right it's a completely different era so

00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:45,440
everything that happens is happening the

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,989
first time maybe in this ecosystem in

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,299
the Python and the PI data ecosystem

00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:52,039
will actually have an instance of

00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:54,559
something happening for the first time

00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,840
where we actually can create a

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,080
sustainable ecosystem of open-source

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,720
developers creators and innovators and

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:08,649
and sustainably sort of oriented mindful

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,450
commercialization of those efforts so

00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:13,039
you know I think ultimately one of the

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,690
questions that I would encourage people

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,039
to think about is you know you can do

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,330
this farm and you think about the farm

00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,309
but at the end of the day what are you

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,739
really farming right what are you really

00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:23,299
cultivating you might say well the farm

00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:24,679
obviously produces fruits and vegetables

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,749
that's what we call to me that's what we

00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,580
work on and then if you think deeper

00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:29,570
you're like well actually it's more of

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,440
an orchard

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,600
what we're really doing is we're tending

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,480
to the trees and every year it produces

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,330
crops it uses a bunch of delicious fruit

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,100
but that's not everything the health of

00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,720
the tree is an important thing but if

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,640
you're really into farming how many

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,050
people here are really into farming but

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,420
you know that the most important thing

00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:50,030
in farming is soil management actually

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,590
the soil and the entire nitrogen cycle

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,910
and of course that ties to your water

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,760
and your groundwater and all these

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,980
things all of that is actually that that

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,080
ground would you stand on is what makes

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,240
all of this possible and so it looks

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,740
similarly for open source we have to

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,020
think about not just hey how do we make

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,970
sure the devs getting paid right you

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:12,020
have to think about actually the soil

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:14,650
itself and for me you know taking this

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,200
metaphor maybe to the final sort of step

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:20,480
I think the unique resource that we have

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,800
that soil you know that we're that we're

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,680
actually cultivating and that we're

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,950
managing and sustaining that's actually

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,580
the it's it's nothing more nothing less

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:33,410
and the sum of all of the creative human

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,430
potential that is in the minds of

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,760
everyone that's plugged into the

00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:39,370
ecosystem that's the soil and so that's

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,530
a hard thing right that's a very

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:44,960
abstract thing but it's actually where

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,790
all this comes from and so in my Kino

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,170
and how its sustaining innovation it's

00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,660
really it kind of comes comes full

00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,520
circle on this concept that we actually

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,080
have to create an ecosystem that keeps

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,270
you a plugged in creates a positive

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,760
community that actually lets everyone be

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,200
creative and lets everyone actually take

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,130
the best thoughts take the really cool

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,780
things they're thinking about and

00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,990
express them and share them with people

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,510
that's really that's it that's all it is

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,310
and yet that's like everything if we

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,350
simply focus on capturing part of it or

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,570
facilitating only one particular part of

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:18,620
the cycle we're gonna miss out on the

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,660
entire circular value network there so

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,740
then to make this much more concrete how

00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,030
do we actually translate this into

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,770
business right what does this mean for

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,390
people who are thinking of themselves

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,570
may be launching businesses or who work

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,530
in businesses that intersect open source

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,290
well in the business world there's a

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,180
really great quote by by Warren Buffett

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,000
what he says well I look for businesses

00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,320
with wide moats right and that's a fine

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,510
thing for Warren Buffett to say cuz he's

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,460
an investor he puts money in to get more

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,399
money out it's very simple Thurman

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,020
right and and a lot of businesses do

00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:49,909
operate this way right some people the

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,730
moat for them the moat is the patent

00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:54,620
portfolio for other people it's really

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,450
like odious licensing terms and it's

00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,640
locking in their customers and keeping

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,169
them from peering out the window and for

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,460
others the the moat is actually

00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,260
technological in nature or even

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,970
linguistic in nature right so you might

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,770
have a pariah Terry language that all

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,000
your customers stuff is locked up in you

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,740
might have pried two extensions two

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,630
sequel and your customers really can't

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,350
leave you without uh pending their

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,940
entire business and and they're thinking

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,740
about this so I'm a little bit of a

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,330
history buff but just a little bit so

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm like the worst history buff right

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,830
and I'm and I'm of the opinion that the

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,470
because the real history is kind of

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,179
boring when you know the details but but

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,860
actually if you think about castles and

00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:33,529
moats you know they're actually fine

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,870
constructions given the period that they

00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,370
came around in so at that time the types

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,929
of kinetic weapons are available to

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,730
people and the kind of physical threats

00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,140
people were facing as well as the kind

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,970
of economic structures right you want a

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,460
scale of agriculture well having a

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,470
hierarchical feudal military you know

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,090
mechanism control was a fine way to

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:54,409
scale agriculture at the level they were

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:56,600
doing agriculture but you know as you as

00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:58,970
you think about moving forward and as we

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,890
develop better science technology as we

00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,860
were able to increase the caloric the

00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:06,740
average caloric energy available to two

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,510
individuals people could actually go and

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,820
have leisure time people could be

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,620
literate we create societies of learning

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,390
and we could create law and have

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,220
actually the rule of law and that

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,070
creates open societies that actually

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,000
lets people engage in a general state of

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,309
trust with each other

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,159
you don't need castle walls then you

00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:28,100
have courts right and so that's I think

00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,899
that then allowing a village to spring

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,480
up as opposed to concentrating all the

00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:35,630
wealth and all of the the crown jewels

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,669
inside some thick walls that really has

00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,080
been kind of the prevailing

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:41,390
inspirational model for what we do a

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,890
continuum so Travis now we started the

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,500
company we wanted to provide

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,270
infrastructure that would that would

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,940
enable these kinds of things to happen

00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,649
we're fundamentally open and free but at

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,360
the same time we also wanted to build a

00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:57,299
company that could set an example for

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,879
how we could do this right and so

00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:02,789
the you know we can we can sort of we

00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:04,559
believe I guess that we can create

00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:05,789
technologies incubate them contribute to

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,129
other technologies that we didn't our

00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,929
selves originated and do all these

00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:13,259
things in the open at the same time vend

00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:17,460
useful products to a larger mass of

00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:18,690
people around the world and so lately

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,309
I've been doing some thinking I've been

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,230
doing a lot of reading into the history

00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:24,299
of economics and communication

00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,639
technology in particular here in the

00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:28,049
United States and what's interesting is

00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,989
if you look at the history of capitalism

00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:34,830
as its in practice in the last 150 years

00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:39,389
it's amazing how entrenched or how how

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:41,909
much entrenched players will destroy the

00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:43,649
very foundations of innovation if

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:45,989
there's anything that threatens their

00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,489
business model at all they will salt the

00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:49,909
earth they will burn down things they

00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:52,379
will bury lab notebooks they will

00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:54,600
destroy lives they will destroy

00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:56,730
infrastructure they will do anything to

00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,080
preserve their business models at the

00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,940
end of the day if there's hundreds of

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,470
billions of dollars of capital value

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,950
it's at risk they will absolutely do it

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,259
and so this is actually in the technical

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,850
domain this is a challenge because

00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:10,559
virtually any innovation can unleash

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,299
create a destruction on somebody's

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,429
business model and actually in this era

00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:16,799
of quantified self quantified world

00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:18,480
self-driving cars you know super

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,239
computing cloud super computing machine

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,460
learning AI all these different things I

00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:25,409
don't I don't know how to predict too

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,999
much about this stuff but I think that a

00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:28,799
lot of what people are gonna do with

00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:30,809
Python for the next 10 years is destroy

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,399
a lot of legacy business models so we're

00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:34,200
really right at the intersection right

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,739
at the vanguard really not just

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,269
intersection with the vanguard of really

00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:42,169
unleashing a lot of this creative

00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:43,980
destructive potential and if that's the

00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:46,710
potential innovation we're gonna be

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,639
unlocking so the question then is how do

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:52,350
we sustain a defense of this little

00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:54,059
verdant Valley this little village of

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,309
innovation that we have when we're

00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,389
producing these you know nuclear weapons

00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:59,369
that are destroying all these old

00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,109
business models right what are the one

00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:03,600
when people start realizing that Oh in

00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:05,159
the Python space is where a lot of the

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,139
innovation that's happening let's go

00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,029
with our IP portfolio and start

00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:11,030
litigating against everyone right or

00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:12,980
let's go and just hire people and

00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,870
down what they're doing all these kinds

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,060
of actually incredibly intentional and

00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,740
incredibly predatory tactics are things

00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,560
that have happened in technology and

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:24,260
ages past even in just the last decade

00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,450
or two and so for us to talk about

00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,700
sustainability of innovation it's not

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,530
merely doing it in some like kumbaya

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,120
forward-looking happy-go-lucky sort of

00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:35,030
way it's actually thinking about also

00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,740
from a strategic perspective of sort of

00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,210
a defensive mentality how do we assure

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,070
that the great things that happen in

00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,140
this space actually continue to happen

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,880
and continue to thrive and I don't

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,220
actually have really great answers for

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,140
that but I want to at least open up that

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,670
question in some of the context of my

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,050
thinking around it because I think it's

00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,060
really important you know we are one

00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,830
company we've done some interesting work

00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,420
we're gonna continue doing I think

00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,310
interesting work and continue to grow in

00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,930
success of our commercial offerings but

00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:02,060
one company is not enough we need many

00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,700
more companies many other people whose

00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,680
livelihoods and whose impact is actually

00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,260
contingent upon the innovation space

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,690
that's happening or the can innovation

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,610
that's happening in this space so with

00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,410
that I'll open it up for questions I

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,150
think we got about five seven more

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,620
minutes and happy that questions

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,880
feedback about anything I said

00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,650
challenges to anything I've said

00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,940
questions about any of these things or

00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:32,119
more yeah thank you very much

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,119
[Applause]

00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:44,730
well I really like the gardening

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,980
metaphor and I'd also never thought

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,690
about the sustainability question from

00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,140
like a defensive perspective so that was

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,820
really interesting but putting aside the

00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:57,330
defensive part of it and just looking at

00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,460
their like it's poor sustainability on

00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,140
it kind of Lee devil's advocate is there

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,810
an actual sustainability crisis in

00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,750
open-source because what I see is with

00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:09,120
developers coming to open-source through

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:11,840
whatever series of motives they have and

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,250
with the high burnout rate that exists

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
even then you still have so much value

00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,370
being created that all these things all

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,590
these trends you talked about at the

00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,830
beginning are still happening so is

00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,810
there a real and I want the same sort of

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,700
gardening to happen that you do but just

00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,840
to be really kind of hard-nosed about it

00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,050
is there an actual internal

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,890
sustainability crisis in open source

00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:37,410
that's an excellent question

00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:39,270
so sustainability of making new little

00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:42,390
saplings that bear a little bit of fruit

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:45,360
is one thing the reason I bring this

00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:47,100
topic up at Jupiter Khan is because we

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,320
are now looking in the distance you know

00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,700
that last the last scene hold isn't a

00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,980
spoiler for anyone but the last scene

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,660
and Field of Dreams when the cameras or

00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,420
pans out and you see a line of cars

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,640
lining up that road from the perspective

00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,560
of folks like Fernando myself and others

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,030
we look out a little bit above our or

00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,580
like we climb to the hill overlooking

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,500
our orchard and we just see dusts from

00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,060
all of the Mongols good Mongols happy

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,760
Mongols I want to come and use and

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,800
partake in this ecosystem and that's

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,380
more than just can we grow new saplings

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,600
every year that's how do we go and do

00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,460
10x 100x you know really there's a

00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,830
production aspect of the software and

00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,669
that was a little bit to my point is

00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,770
well about production of knowledge

00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:28,679
artifacts a maintenance of those things

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,080
that becomes a very very heavy lift and

00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,370
if we never bridge that gap if we never

00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:37,470
basically as a community never grow the

00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,510
the skills or the knowledge of how to do

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,920
this then the open source world will

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,830
forever be seen as

00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,480
the place where you go to get good toys

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:48,270
but to get your real stuff you're gonna

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,190
go and buy from the big legacy vendor

00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:54,600
here that's five to ten years behind and

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:56,550
the cost of that is then not one that we

00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,990
benchmark against is their cool stuff

00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,850
happening because yeah it's low there's

00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,990
always cool stuff happening well we have

00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,670
to hold ourselves to is the higher

00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,300
standard of what could we have done that

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,100
was much better

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,930
right we could have saved how many more

00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,520
lives if these cancer researchers didn't

00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,160
have to pay this much for licenses for

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,420
this piece of crap software right that's

00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,710
the kind of question I think that's the

00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,290
kind of standard that we should aspire

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:45,540
to and and really kind of plant a flag

00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:48,720
on that particular point thank you yeah

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:51,270
so the question of product market fit

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,490
versus technology market fit I actually

00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:57,090
had a small little section of slides on

00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:59,010
the technology value chain where you

00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:02,780
know I was gonna talk a little bit more

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:06,150
about this and and the the thing is that

00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,680
when businesses it really is a business

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,680
facing rights owned businesses consume

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,130
technology there's sort of different

00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,860
levels at which they want to terminate

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,690
their concern right and say okay at this

00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,730
point I'm not gonna worry about it I'm

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,410
assuming the vendor or the supplier you

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,630
know call a vendor the supplier has

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,610
taken care of this issue for me when you

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,620
consume technology you're onboarding as

00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,560
a business as a consumer you're taking

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:34,920
on a lot more stuff when you take on a

00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,810
product the vendor the supplier makes

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,790
representations warranties all sorts of

00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,440
other things and you can actually you

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:43,230
know it's very transactional I will give

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,790
you X dollars and you guarantee that if

00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,020
I have a problem I can call somebody up

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,330
and get somebody who's gonna solve this

00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:52,110
problem for me within five hours right

00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:53,640
so it's about what the business has to

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,690
worry about right there's difference

00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,160
between the

00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,020
you know where you draw the line of

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,810
where it's just technology and where

00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:03,750
it's actually a product and and really

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:06,060
an aspect of product I think is the you

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,099
know the ubiquity of the need right if

00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,770
you build a very tailored if you just

00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,869
have raw technology that can solve many

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,540
many problems but the key word is it can

00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:17,730
solve many problems and the actual

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,550
solution is still left as an exercise

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:23,640
for the consumer or the adopter a

00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,530
product does solve problems and it

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,650
solves a very specific set of problems

00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:30,569
and the vendor or the creator of that

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,490
product believes they're making a bet

00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:34,920
that that exact problem that the

00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,300
problems that the thing solves is common

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,859
enough that people will buy it off the

00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:43,520
shelf right and that's really the

00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:45,869
distinction between those two hey Peter

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,790
so your point about open source of

00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:50,310
business and why businesses are adopting

00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:53,099
open source I wonder if you could speak

00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,839
it all to like businesses being involved

00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,550
in open source as starting to become

00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:04,290
table stakes or even to getting

00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:05,640
developers to come yeah so that's an

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,050
interesting thing right because we see

00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,780
that all over the place a lot of lot of

00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:12,510
businesses they're realizing that by

00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,260
showing up to the open source party they

00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:19,230
you know the you know they pick up

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,109
cooler devs to put it kind of crassly

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,579
and and that basically I think

00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:25,650
summarizes kind of how I feel about that

00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:27,420
right that I feel like for a business to

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,890
really care about open source the way

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,079
they care about o their Oracle

00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,250
production database going down that's

00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,069
the level that we should have the

00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,500
concern not this lets me you know cut my

00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:39,510
recruiter staff by 20 percent and get

00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,109
better data it's like that's that's a

00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:45,930
very that's a what they call a bottom

00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:48,720
line issue right it's a it's a cost sort

00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:51,060
of issue whereas open source for the

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,210
purposes of tracking innovation of

00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,400
having a Batna as a business you know

00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,780
when the vendor comes up and wants to

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,000
charge you ten percent motor licenses

00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,060
those are the kinds of concerns that are

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,170
more forward-looking and so I think the

00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,730
recruiter thing is great I mean I think

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,260
it's still a great thing to get more

00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,250
funding into the ecosystems on open

00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,340
source but

00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:12,570
it's almost or like oh I have to pay you

00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,950
know it's like a pay-to-play kind of

00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:16,140
scheme it just feels a little bit like

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,910
you know it's it's fine

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,030
their transact there's a very clear

00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:22,530
transaction there and I the reason I

00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,560
wouldn't necessarily want to count on it

00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:28,560
is because the instant they find some

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,230
other way to target and identify and

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,900
attract other deaths by let's say having

00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,940
a keg in the fridge or by like having

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,650
cooler office space if that becomes

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,609
cheaper than funding open source guess

00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,930
what you're gonna get a keg in the

00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,550
fridge instead of funding some critical

00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,900
piece of open source right that's why I

00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,430
don't like to make that it's like a

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,599
spreadsheet trade-off as opposed to an

00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:51,960
aspirational value based investment

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:56,040
thank you so yeah we have to finish the

00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,230
session there yeah play me round I'll be

00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,420
the the continuum booth so having a chat

00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,290
so let's thank Peter again for a very

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,130
nice tool thank you everyone

00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:06,130
