Title: Beautiful networks and network analytics made simpler with Jupyter - Daina Bouquin, John DeBlase
Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Performing network analytics with NetworkX and Jupyter often results in difficult-to-examine hairballs rather than useful visualizations. Meanwhile, more flexible tools like SigmaJS have high learning curves for people new to JavaScript. Daina Bouquin and John DeBlase share a simple, flexible architecture that can help create beautiful JavaScript networks without ditching the Jupyter Notebook.

	00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:06,160
I am from the Center for Astrophysics in

00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,260
Cambridge Massachusetts is actually

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,839
where I'm from John is down here in the

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,570
city and he's an app developer and I am

00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,090
actually a librarian so I'm the head

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,840
librarian at the CFA and John helps get

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,279
things done here with CUNY and the

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,960
reason why we're here in front of you

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,220
today is because we with some

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,019
serendipity found ourselves actually

00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,359
taking a class together we're both

00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:34,710
finishing up our master's degrees in

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:38,170
data analytics and we were given

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,949
projects pretty frequently that asked us

00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:44,550
to work in groups and about a year ago

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:50,160
John and I started working on a project

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:53,530
that made us notice a pretty big problem

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,510
so we were in a course on network

00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:59,730
analytics of all things called web

00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,730
analytics just to confuse everyone and

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,500
as a result we were asked pretty often

00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:09,790
to work with packages that really were

00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,170
not optimized for visualizing networks

00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,659
because we were being asked to work in

00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,580
Jupiter notebooks and so in these

00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:17,170
courses we were being told to here turn

00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,630
in your Jupiter notebook put your

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,750
markdown in there and a lot of the time

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,009
the culmination of the analytics that we

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:32,399
were doing would ask us to create a

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:35,020
visualization of what we had done and oh

00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,149
I should also speculate I put these in a

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,960
little bit in the wrong order we decided

00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:42,850
we should focus on this problem that you

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,560
have to you can't really make good

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,119
network visualizations using the

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,250
packages that we were being you know

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,530
suggested to use in Jupiter because it's

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,329
really important so the more that we did

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,040
these exercises the more it became

00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:56,710
obvious that it was getting it was

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,689
really hard to actually show the

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,600
instructor or really anyone in the class

00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,490
the impact of what you were seeing

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,649
because all you had was a couple of

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,410
numbers either that or you'd have to

00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,600
kind of jump ship completely leave the

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,490
jupiter notebook do something with

00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,030
javascript do something with Jeffie do

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,800
something

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,340
cytoscape one of these other packages

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,770
where you you have to there's a pretty

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,150
high barrier for entry essentially you'd

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,980
have to learn a completely different

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,150
protocol different way of working and

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,459
then you'd have to find some way to kind

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,870
of screen just got it and put it into

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,270
the duper notebook that's clearly not

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,380
ideal and on top of that it really

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:37,569
hinders your ability to use the network

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,940
visualizations to actually infer things

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:42,400
so when you're doing analytics when

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,050
you're working with a network if you

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,730
can't really see what you're looking at

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,190
it's kind of hard to know what questions

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,750
to ask and it's also difficult to

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,360
perceive trends that might not be

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:56,470
obvious at first glance from looking at

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,290
your numbers and so with that in mind

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:02,350
knowing that network visualization is

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:06,010
important not just to us in school but

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:11,350
to scientists and anyone really looking

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:17,230
to work with network objects we decided

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:19,329
to try to find a way to make it so you

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,060
could give data scientists and

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:26,769
researchers and other people who are

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,959
using Jupiter as their primary kind of

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,610
way to share their work give them

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,180
something that would help them make

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,340
useful and engaging graphics so that you

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,610
can both do make inferences and really

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,940
present your work without making people

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:47,140
leave the platform that their work

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,900
relies on so we think it's probably

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,540
better rather than completely

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:57,519
reinventing the wheel though to do this

00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:00,880
to leverage some tools that are already

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,519
optimized for this purpose so there are

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,079
already really great packages that exist

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,880
in the world to help you create graph

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,090
objects and help you visualize graph

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,590
objects and work with them and the goal

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,269
isn't necessarily to make some new thing

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,789
to put on top of the thing you already

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,680
have the idea was more to make it so

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,169
that you wouldn't necessarily have to

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,990
have that big lift so you lower the

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,720
barrier for entry into

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,000
using these tools without making a whole

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,479
new kind of proprietary layer on top of

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,539
what we were doing so try to connect

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,889
them to the notebook and I know that I

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:40,590
see some heads shaking in the room

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,020
Network X is probably something a lot of

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,819
you have worked with if you're

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,259
interested at all in network objects and

00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,449
work in Python and work in Jupiter

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,340
notebooks which I hope is probably most

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,810
of you otherwise I'm really not sure

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,490
what you're doing here maybe your

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,880
masochists or maybe you're really bored

00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:03,000
but network X is a really popular

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,020
library a module in Python for doing

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,479
analytics but when you work with this

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:18,680
package you immediately start to see how

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:22,919
it goes wrong so this is what I call a

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Glee plot this is just not very useful

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,509
so this is really what we were working

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,789
with initially that prompted me and John

00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:32,280
to actually start working together and

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,880
talking about this because I have

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,330
something to say here you have no idea

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,300
what it is and it is very difficult to

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,330
work with and I frankly think that it's

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,430
kind of a waste of time to try to make

00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,320
this pretty because the amount of leg

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,229
work you're doing to try to work with

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,389
this natively could be put towards

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,270
learning an entirely different language

00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:01,830
that's really built for this problem and

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,259
so we thought we could dig something

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,729
better and I know it's kind of hard to

00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,280
see there because the color on this

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:13,080
screen isn't that great but this is a

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,330
screenshot of the little app side by

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,130
side app that we built that you can

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,139
launch from within the Jupiter notebook

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,020
and you see it better to do zoom in okay

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,240
okay we'll give you a demo at the end so

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,440
please don't rely on squinting at this

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,479
but we tried to create something using

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,570
tools that are already optimized for

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,949
this purpose to try to do something I

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,009
think that's a quite a bit better than

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,860
that first red blob

00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:42,379
and what we made it so you can do is you

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,039
can work with your network your network

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:49,129
X object in the Python in the Jupiter

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,539
notebook and then you can run a script

00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,789
after doing a couple of simple

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:56,259
installation steps that'll let you

00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:59,059
launch in another tab in your browser an

00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:01,309
interactive network tool that'll let you

00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:03,349
select and zoom in and play around and

00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:05,689
move around your network and then create

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:07,449
your own data set a subset based on what

00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:09,529
you selected and the measures and the

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,050
attributes that you may have appended to

00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:17,599
your notes and export them as a CSV file

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:19,159
I think that that's a lot nicer and I'm

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,899
going to keep walking back to the middle

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:26,210
and so the last year when we started

00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:28,849
talking about this initially it was a

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,839
standalone kind of prototype just for a

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:35,839
class and this semester because we're

00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,029
still in school we decided to actually

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:42,770
integrate it with Jupiter so it's not a

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:45,469
standalone thing anymore and it's what

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:49,839
we're calling eye Pi Sigma so it's a

00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:52,580
little bit of a hat tip to the ipython

00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,919
nomenclature so to speak and because it

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,629
makes use of Sigma Jas

00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,050
we thought we'd integrate that and so

00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:03,800
what I want this to be seen as is more

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,990
of an extensible prototype so it works

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,149
we have more that we think that could be

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,219
done with it but it's really more of a

00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,959
framework and a line of reasoning that

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:15,219
I'm hoping to share with you all and to

00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:18,469
get your feedback and input on so

00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:21,229
without further ado what are the pieces

00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:27,499
so if we don't want to reinvent the

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:29,449
wheel and we're really trying to not

00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:31,009
make people leave their environment why

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,159
did we actually decide to pick with

00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,930
stick with Jupiter as it not only is

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,449
Jupiter I mean I'm kind of preaching to

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:41,029
the choir here but if you want to have

00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:44,600
something that makes it so you can share

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:45,800
your work easily and that you can kind

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,910
of containerize everything that you're

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,560
working on and you value reproducibility

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,330
this is really the platform we should be

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,250
paying attention to so rather than

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,980
trying to make something that works with

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,750
a different development environment we

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,950
really thought that sticking with this

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,300
would be best especially in the

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,680
educational setting that we were in

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,630
because we were the students having the

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:12,080
problem being told the youth Jupiter and

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:16,820
we decided to use a JavaScript library

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,820
called Sigma J s so Sigma if you have

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,300
not heard of it is just an open

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,040
JavaScript library that's specifically

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,700
dedicated to doing network

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,110
visualizations it's optimized for that

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:35,600
purpose excuse me and so unlike

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,460
libraries like d3 which is great and

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,710
accessible this is really just for that

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,610
purpose so we definitely don't want to

00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:45,830
try to take something as big as d3 and

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:50,780
shoehorn it into this we want it to be a

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,250
little more lightweight and so John is

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,640
actually going to talk a little bit

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,590
about what this is that we made and how

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,600
it works and you can see already from

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,900
the graph though you tried to make this

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,760
really pretty clean so it's not very

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,880
heavy and I think that it's an

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,720
extensible protocol so take it away John

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,670
yeah okay so this basically here's your

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,780
standard technical diagram of how things

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,280
work I guess a control flow or whatever

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,540
you know so on the left hand side we

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,430
have the Jupiter notebook which we're

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,860
going to be using as sort of like you

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,990
know which is our front-end tool of

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,660
choice for doing the analytical side of

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,100
stuff and we can see it connecting with

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,280
the server with the Jupiter notebook

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,650
server and then you know behind

00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,800
everything is of course the kernel where

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,850
are you know API is sitting along with

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,730
everything else you've loaded it the

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,790
Python while you're doing your work and

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,640
the idea is that our nodejs server is

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,290
actually going to connect to the you

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,680
know the notebook server directly and

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,870
we're using the tools provided by

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,700
jupiter lab services which are a set of

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,700
JavaScript it's a JavaScript API

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,910
and from there all of those smaller

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,790
connections are just WebSockets so you

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,170
actually just open a bi-directional line

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,470
of communication with the object that

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,950
you're working with and from there you

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,940
can spin up different browser tabs with

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:20,840
you know the graphs that you want to

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:24,620
study what else is there to say about

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,690
that what else is there what else is

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,440
there to say about that so you can see

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:34,370
the idea go back a second so the idea

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,560
here is that when you're working in your

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,890
Jupiter notebook you could open up many

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,780
tabs Braille you're not just working

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,370
with one graph object that you put in a

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,580
tab you could have another tab and you

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:49,340
can compare right exactly and you know

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,370
this is kind of the data the design as

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:55,100
it stands now and we're looking to make

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,780
it a little more robust by like allowing

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,400
multiple graphs within a single browser

00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,700
tab and this sort of thing but this is

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,830
where we're at right with it right now

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,570
yeah and that it's using a WebSocket to

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,590
open up like hopefully bi-directional

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,330
communication even though right now

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,850
there isn't a lot of that going on per

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,070
se so we're kind of we you know I was

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,320
building this with the idea of you know

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,540
like where it will be where it can be

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,930
eventually you know with more with more

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,640
work and so I will also reiterate the

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,450
caveat we started making this as a

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,900
school project so those of you with a

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,340
lot more JavaScript experience ideas

00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,960
yeah so sorry about all the jQuery

00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,970
alright so but we're using all open

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,440
protocols that are all really common and

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:44,330
in order to get started with using this

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,230
tool these are all of the instructions

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:51,260
you need we have a github repo that

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,750
basically has everything built in you

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,090
need to follow a couple of different

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,010
steps just to make sure your environment

00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,860
is set up well enough so that you have

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,510
Python and node configured properly and

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,010
so if you're running on a different

00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,590
operating system or something like that

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,970
this this may have to be tweaked but for

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,850
the most part this is pretty much

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,949
vanilla and

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,319
that makes it pretty nice and as we've

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:20,630
been alluded to looting - there are some

00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:23,389
limitations so right now it only works

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,540
with Network X graph objects like I said

00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:30,740
in the beginning those red nasty things

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:33,740
the the way that we see it is you could

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,949
basically augment the code the source

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,959
code to make it so it could ingest any

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,389
kind of graph object that you can throw

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,430
at it if you have graph ml if you wanted

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,589
to import a CSV and then turn it into

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:50,389
your own kind of object I think that you

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:51,709
really could do that yeah also

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:54,620
refreshing the browser can cause

00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:56,000
problems yeah well that's just basically

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,860
you know if you have a WebSocket

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,269
connection it'll just break it and you

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,589
know we don't have code in place yet to

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:05,720
deal with that scenario so so same often

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:08,649
and that's the kind of thing that we

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,480
know there are solutions for but

00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:13,639
basically we've looked into using in

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,380
browser memory something like low key

00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,899
but I think it's a little bit above our

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,750
heads right now but we know that there

00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,350
are potential solutions out there we

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:26,899
also didn't use a development framework

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,000
so well yeah there's no yeah in the

00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,410
future maybe moving this to like angular

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,720
or something would make more sense but

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,910
you know where we the original version

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,100
of this was actually just a flask

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,449
application so it made the most sense to

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,410
pour it as much code from that as

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:45,649
possible so anyways yeah so so here I

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:49,250
hope you try - yeah oops oh not yet not

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:50,720
yet okay go back wait this one yeah so

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,060
there's still a couple more limitations

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,829
sorry

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,529
ideally less be alerted - we'd like to

00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:59,180
store multiple graphs in a tab so when

00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,930
we do the demo you'll see that you can

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,120
name a graph object in a tab and bring

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,500
up that graph ideally you would just be

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,170
able to bring up the other graph that

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,060
you also named to yourself so that you

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,680
can show them both in the same browser

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,279
tab but that functionality is just not

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,889
really there yet

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,610
and it has a few hacks built in so I'm

00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,519
sure you'll find them

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:27,799
it's not perfect but we're really glad

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:31,319
for what it can do already so alright

00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:35,699
yeah so we're going to show you I Pi

00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:38,819
Sigma in action but before I move

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,739
forward with the demo notebook there's

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:44,160
some definitions so I mentioned I'm a

00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:45,869
librarian and one of the things that

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,110
John and I were actually exploring and

00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:51,660
working on were some questions I had

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,779
related to publication tendencies with

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,269
my community so I don't know how many of

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:59,100
you are in scholarly landscape or how

00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:04,350
many of you really work in publishing

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:07,079
but it's useful for scientists to know

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:10,249
the impact that they have on their

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,809
communities and for them to know who is

00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:17,189
so for us to see trends in their

00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:19,709
behavior and one of the funny things out

00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:23,009
there in the scholarly publishing realm

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:26,549
is a phrase called impact factor so this

00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:30,269
is a measure that's frequently used to

00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:33,600
kind of show the impact a particular

00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:35,279
article has in the field and so that's a

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,860
number that's assigned to the journal

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,989
that you're publishing in and a lot of

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,779
the time you're really incentivized to

00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:44,610
publish in a high-impact journal so that

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,649
you can really push and show like look I

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,329
should get tenure look at the impact I'm

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:50,549
having and it's like a feather in your

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:52,829
hat I published in science or something

00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:56,939
like that and the cost of those journals

00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:58,949
are typically exorbitant and so one of

00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:01,649
the things the conversations going on in

00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:04,230
libraries right now is the push towards

00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:06,089
more open publications and trying to

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,649
figure out different ways to measure the

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,169
value of contributions of our

00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:12,269
communities so that we can really you

00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:14,789
know show what we're up to

00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:16,799
the other bit of jargon so remember

00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,639
impact factor is assigned to a journal

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,250
and the degree centrality so if you're

00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,409
in network analytics at all or if you've

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,819
really done any network analytics there

00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:28,980
are a lot of different centrality

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:32,250
measures out there but centrality

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,590
measures more broadly help you identify

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,980
the most

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,140
important vertices in a graph so the

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,289
most important node in your big spider

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,809
web and those are different ways of

00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:48,620
thinking about impact so what's the most

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:52,279
important node in a graph or what is the

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,559
impact factor of the journal so that's

00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,080
going to be kind of the foundation of

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,700
the demo so it doesn't completely make

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:08,840
no sense actually if you move over one

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:13,039
more tab to so yeah so if you hit my

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,330
side one more time okay nevermind maybe

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,980
I didn't put it up just remember the big

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,169
hairball I wanted to do a comparison

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,510
oh well though everyone can remember the

00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:23,630
hairball yeah all right

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:26,120
and it's running okay so this is sort of

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:31,179
like what the notebook or this is what

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,179
this is our demo welcome to the demo

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,890
basically we're just importing this

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:40,460
object here and that's like acts as a

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,330
controller and sort of a daemon although

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,960
it doesn't have all that functionality

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,700
built in yet but it sort of essentially

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,320
manages the Express server and makes all

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,010
the WebSocket connections for you so

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,799
that the graphs know where to go one

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:57,590
thing okay so you basically you load you

00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:01,580
load these guys I pre-loaded this you

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:04,070
would run each of these cells you import

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:08,600
this guy this is the main class and you

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:11,360
got to point it to the wherever you

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,950
installed the Express server part of the

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,270
application it could be anywhere and you

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,429
know you just have to point it to the

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,049
right spot basically in our case it's

00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:22,070
just you know I'm in the root folder so

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:24,140
I'm just pointing it there yeah so all

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,929
that's going to do is you know it fires

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:31,010
up it you know opens a subprocess and

00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:32,720
loads the Express server up and gives

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,340
you a PID in case something goes

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,340
horribly wrong and you need to cancel it

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,780
so from there yeah so basically in terms

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,460
of like you know I when I was thinking

00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,080
about designing and it's like I wanted

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,730
to keep this as simple as possible like

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,940
I didn't want anybody to have to use it

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,029
like

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,340
our own classes like sub classing like

00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:54,080
the graphs and sub you know some sub

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,129
classing anything from the graph or

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,840
having to wrap the NX object inside of

00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:01,700
another object you know kind of having

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,220
to bootstrap it like I I felt like

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,409
that's like less intuitive you know for

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,359
maybe uh you know I didn't want to

00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:09,649
disrupt like the workflow you know like

00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,749
you have a workflow going and you're

00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:13,070
doing some analysis and all right now I

00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:15,559
have to use this library and you got to

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,759
you know add a bunch of lines to the

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,499
code so I was trying to make this as

00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,720
like smooth a thing as possible

00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:22,070
so it didn't disrupt anything while

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,690
you're in the notebook is like when we

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,779
were working on this project originally

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,889
you know one of the first things you

00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:29,889
know not really and you know Dana

00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:33,289
mentioned like we were using neo4j a lot

00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:35,809
which is cool and actually gave gave us

00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:37,729
the idea for the project but in order to

00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:41,450
do that we had a you know inlet

00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:43,460
basically stop what you're doing

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,989
dump everything out and then load neo4j

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,159
and then load that and you have to have

00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:48,950
a server running and all this other

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,049
stuff outside of the notebook so you

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,419
know that was involved what not sequel

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:56,090
yeah like well sequel could be involved

00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,409
and if you want it but yeah you have to

00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,570
like you know not everybody wants to

00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:01,489
learn the neo4j I forget what the

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,099
language is called but cipher right

00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:06,559
thanks which was kind of it's cool but I

00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:08,749
just I found like it was distracting me

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:15,019
us from you know doing what we needed to

00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:17,720
get to do so you know so our data set

00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:20,869
loads so like we basically this is the

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:25,009
it has to adhere to a certain schema you

00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:28,369
know to get the most out of the our our

00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:30,349
app so we're always gonna pass in a

00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:31,820
label and a we're gonna set the note

00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:33,590
attributes there's always going to be a

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,720
label and there's always going to be a

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,940
node type and if you don't do that it

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,129
will still generate a graph but you

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,509
won't have some of like the features

00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:45,649
that make this cool which is like

00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:46,909
different colors and things yeah so and

00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:48,830
this is like what an edge list would

00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:52,369
look like you know just to show you that

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:54,320
this is just a raw in X object so then

00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:57,979
all we have to do is pass that object in

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,290
along with a key name and use this

00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:02,510
connect method which I already did I

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:06,350
believe so all we have to do is run this

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,820
and we get this screen and we just you

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,670
can put in a graph title here this is

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,380
more for function future functionality

00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,600
because the idea would be within each

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,060
browser there would be a memory cache

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,190
and you could like cache each graph via

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,110
its name and the in the in the browser

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,540
session but I haven't haven't gotten

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,640
that far yet and so now we just load and

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,620
boom and now you have a nice graph and

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,020
you can look at it and you can see them

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,180
in and you can click on it and you get

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,310
this is all stuff functionality from

00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,990
Sigma pretty much you get out of the box

00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:38,000
like I mean there's a few plugins added

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,670
to this through the gravity plug-in and

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,070
then you know you we have a little

00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:46,820
Explorer object that you can toggle

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:49,850
around and you know poke around and see

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,240
who's who in your graph and it's just a

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,280
lot

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,070
basically this it's just a lot nicer

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:58,040
than looking at a red hairball so I

00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:59,930
should spend say that the data set the

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,120
leaders showed in the demo is the same

00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,480
data set that the initial red hairball

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,970
was made of it's a very very general

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,780
search of the NASA astrophysics data

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:16,790
system for the most cited most recent 50

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,620
papers that are on stars and so what you

00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,470
can see though is if you zoom out when

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,530
you hover over so like this big node

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,540
John's steering so you can see that this

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,820
is the Astrophysical Journal and you can

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,120
see that when you double-click on it and

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,980
you can see at the side you've got our

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,840
degree centrality it's got a PageRank

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,850
it's got between this it's those are

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,130
just things that we already decided and

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,970
calculate it out but you can add your

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:46,190
own attributes to these things but you

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,460
can see that the measure of the degree

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,930
centrality is pretty darn high and

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,730
although like the white balance on the

00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,950
screen is really making it so you can

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,270
see all routes you can see them I

00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,190
promise in the browser we should have

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,410
tried this on this screen but if you

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,380
select there's a small there's many

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,750
smaller ones so if you look I can't

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,680
remember it's around there yeah what are

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,000
you looking for nature or nature one

00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,700
I think it might be a little more

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,280
disconnected or down it might be the so

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,650
one of these nodes which we didn't just

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:21,960
automatically put the labels on is the

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:25,740
journal Nature and it's much smaller

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:29,340
I promise than the apt right there it is

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,370
so there we go so the Astrophysical

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,860
Journal so if you remove the middle one

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,360
the middle one from that I mean I guess

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,040
it doesn't matter to remove it remove

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,630
the row but you can say you can remove

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,790
the row if you did I look you wanna move

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:47,910
the room something yeah this is sort of

00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:49,470
the kind of case that sometimes I'm

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,630
looking to make and looking to promote

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,060
and it's pretty easy to see when you

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,010
look at nature compared to the

00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,580
Astrophysical Journal you can very

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:02,160
clearly see that the the centrality

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,770
measure is higher meaning it is a much

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,490
more impactful node in the graph and

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,890
it's also much bigger so you see many

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:15,110
more collaborations going on here and

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,110
you see that that publication is

00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:20,310
impacting the overall field much more

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,740
dramatically than the nature note is

00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,690
however I'm going to make sure I have

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,970
the numbers right here when you look at

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,860
impact factor so the numbers that are

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,530
assigned to journals by publishers

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,310
Nature has an impact factor of forty

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,230
point one three seven but Astrophysical

00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:41,250
Journal has an impact factor of five

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:43,620
point oh one four so according to one

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:47,370
measure the journal Nature is eight

00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,230
times more impactful than the Astronomy

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,450
Journal but I'm trying to make the case

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,060
here that this is clearly

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,940
domain-specific and that when we're

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,310
talking about tenure we're talking about

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,990
giving postdocs the ability to really

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,360
promote their work and to talk more

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,280
about what they're doing we shouldn't

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,890
just be kind of encouraging these

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:12,020
high-impact papers we should be giving

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:15,750
more credit even to these journals that

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:19,059
clearly matter more in their field and

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:22,029
so the tool here I think

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:24,639
is a really nice way to lower the

00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:26,710
technical barriers and a little bit of

00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:29,590
this intimidation too for making an

00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,840
argument so I said I'm a librarian and I

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,539
like to think that I have some technical

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,340
skills but I know that there are a lot

00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,379
of other people in my field who don't

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,110
necessarily have the same capacities

00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:43,870
that I feel confident with there are a

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:47,139
lot of other fields too where people use

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:49,059
networks and they have to pass off their

00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:51,519
ability to actually make visualizations

00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:54,330
to others that can be expensive it

00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,830
removes this person from the ability to

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,950
make those creative inferences on their

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,350
own and I think that if we can lower the

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:05,259
barrier without giving people handicaps

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:08,110
a little bit more often that you'll have

00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:09,610
more voices in the conversation and the

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,820
development conversation and really

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:15,639
being able to contribute more to these

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:18,039
problems and to really be more actively

00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:21,580
engaged on top of it looking pretty so

00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:23,740
you can customize the colors and you can

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:28,029
name your graphs whatever you want and

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,830
you can export it also if you want it to

00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:31,869
export all of these nodes you just

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,330
select the ones you want you can export

00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,009
them as a CSV file flat format and you

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,720
can send them to whoever you need to

00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,309
send them to or you can keep them for

00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,009
yourself because then you've created a

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:43,929
flat file with those measures that you

00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:45,820
need and you don't even need to hand off

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,100
your Python notebook unless you want to

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,740
and if someone wanted to reproduce what

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,570
you did I mean it's not as challenging

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,399
still you'd have to kind of select the

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,559
nodes you want to make the graph but

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,669
they have a list of those things so I do

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,869
think that it's still pretty

00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:06,399
reproducible and we're at about 30

00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:09,490
minutes now and I know we have 40 and I

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:12,519
wanted to kind of get your feedback on

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,590
this if you have any and questions if

00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,330
you have any leaving a little extra time

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,070
for questions if you have if we hear

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,320
crickets I'll just get off the stage and

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,320
we'll be done a little early so

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,000
not yet but that's a good idea

00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:35,990
Hey so right now yeah we aren't we don't

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,180
have much export yes yes yep so it's on

00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:42,080
github than I might my repository just

00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:45,650
grab it yeah feel free to play with it

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,610
it's cool so if you or did you put a

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:52,550
link in there yeah the link if you go

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,560
back to the slides all right that's cool

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,880
wait where is that yeah we're doing this

00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,250
you can't actually see it on the screen

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,200
this is kind of funny so wait all right

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,570
yeah where the other oh there's a first

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,700
cloned the repo that's actually

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:12,410
clickable sorry yeah so b:00

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,860
/i Pi Sigma - that's my handle sorry

00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,390
about that

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,830
yeah so there was much in here you can

00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:27,920
just say I'll give it to you after -

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:30,080
that's cool yeah no I

00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,670
I've thought about that I that's

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,180
something I haven't I personally haven't

00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:37,970
explored so the answer is that's that's

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,560
a really cool idea and I actually don't

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,720
know much about the plug-in system yet

00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,220
would you / it's something I haven't

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,320
experimented with the reason we I went

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,870
this route was because when we were

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,290
designing this I wasn't sure I like the

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,940
idea of using two servers and having an

00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:56,870
having it like as a separate app so that

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,460
if we you know I wasn't quite sure yet

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,590
you know like what we would be doing

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,110
with persistence and like having maybe

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,030
having a database off of that server so

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:08,240
yeah that's why I didn't go that route

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:10,100
in the beginning right that's what yeah

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm trying yeah we're it was a lot of

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:16,370
juggling like trying to figure out like

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,900
the right configuration and it's just an

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,040
experiment really you know I just

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,610
thought it would be interesting to try

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,610
to do so

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,330
you could certainly do that exact same

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:40,140
analysis with that this tool and I can

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,660
promise you it's you can start to see

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,070
the impact of open source versus the

00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,810
page subscriptions but it's a little bit

00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,790
harder to do because the data set that

00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:51,360
I'm working with is I used the NASA

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,730
astrophysics data system API to pull out

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,690
the data and the publisher isn't always

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:59,970
obvious and the impact of archive on the

00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,250
field is pretty dramatic and so you

00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:06,720
can't necessarily see our kyv citations

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:08,700
always in the so archive is a preprint

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,590
server that makes it so you can really

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,420
just deposit your papers before they're

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:15,240
all marked up by the publisher and in

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,710
astronomy and astrophysics it's a really

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,450
really crucial resource so it's a little

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:28,590
harder to actually definitively say yeah

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:30,630
oh yeah that was well we hadn't thought

00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,730
much about integrating with Jaffee I

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:34,740
know that I hadn't worked with Jeffie in

00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,270
a very long time and when we I started

00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,010
looking back into it it just seemed like

00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,080
another thing to have to learn and I was

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,250
working in in school so honestly it's

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,690
not been the kind of thing we've turned

00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,220
I've turned back to I don't know if you

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,480
think I messed with it a little I when

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,750
we were when we were working on this

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,520
last year when we were looking for

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,410
solutions you know like I explained I

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,180
ended a bill mcneal for Jay to do some

00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,380
of that stuff where after I was trying

00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,240
to do it just because I could do it on

00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,040
the fly a little faster and that's like

00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,300
what influenced this workflow obviously

00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,420
but yeah the other thing we're on

00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,340
caffee's Jeffy's cool you know I just it

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,900
is it's like it's it's a big program and

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,520
you have to really spend a lot of time

00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,890
with it you know and that was something

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,050
where I was at I wasn't like I didn't

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,050
have the resources or time to do that I

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:25,330
didn't know that oh that's cool

00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:28,120
oh yeah all right I'd like to learn

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,650
about that so there's so many things out

00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,930
there it's like you'd never you know

00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,190
it's you can't it's hard to find them

00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:37,870
all that's that's cool that's what's

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:39,580
really cool okay thank you and I think

00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:50,620
we have time for just a couple more if

00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:52,540
anyone has classic con yeah maybe that's

00:32:50,620 --> 00:33:09,370
a good way to do it is it just ported

00:32:52,540 --> 00:33:11,620
I've you know yeah yeah so right right I

00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,650
guess one of the things is like I'm

00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,429
envisioning this at some point being

00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:17,110
something where you can really

00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:19,690
communicate with the object and maybe

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:22,179
manipulate the object from the from the

00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,070
application window right so you wouldn't

00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:25,780
be or maybe you could you know exactly

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:31,690
what would you would you would probably

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:33,940
work for that yeah cool I'll check that

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:37,800
out that sounds great awesome

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,800
yeah yeah go on

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:50,990
I can't hear you oh it's a pie I did it

00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:52,760
in Python 2 7 I don't actually oh right

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,960
yeah I guess it is in Python 2 7 sorry

00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,309
that's just like what I'm used to

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,120
working in but yeah we should probably

00:33:55,309 --> 00:34:09,619
port that oops answer is not 3 the

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:14,899
answer is not 3 sorry and well ok was

00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:16,760
that I don't know I think 50 papers and

00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:20,300
all of the authors affiliated with those

00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,619
50 papers so I could probably dig in

00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,659
there and look it up I can look that up

00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:27,470
for you we can follow up afterwards it's

00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:31,639
not a it wasn't huge but it was sizable

00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:33,320
yeah so the thing is you can oh I think

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,250
that this is a more of an existential

00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,220
problem in network visualization the the

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:43,580
scalability of any kind of tool for that

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,649
but I think for day-to-day the people

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:47,240
who this is really more going to help

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:48,980
out are the people who don't want a

00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,899
necessarily jump ship from the Jupiter

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,609
notebook and a lot of people who are

00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,050
doing their development in the Jupiter

00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:57,280
notebook aren't really working with

00:34:54,050 --> 00:35:01,369
things that go beyond that kind of scale

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,550
yeah well I mean when the older project

00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:06,680
we did that this was based off of we did

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,320
do some analysis like on a large island

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,480
network with like that had over 15,000

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,670
edges with like a lot fewer nodes but

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,980
that I didn't want to show that because

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,170
it totally crushes you know the browser

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,840
it doesn't matter you know it doesn't

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,700
matter it'll just tear it doesn't matter

00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,490
how many you know cuz you can give it as

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,320
many as many edges or nodes as you want

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,430
by did you know if it crashes the

00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,609
browser it's gonna crash the browser

00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,950
there's nothing you can do about that so

00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:37,640
so let's get reality and I think that's

00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,820
good you good cool thank you guys

00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,859


00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,859
