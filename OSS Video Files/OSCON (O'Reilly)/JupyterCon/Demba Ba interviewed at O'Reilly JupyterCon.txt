hi I'm Paco Nathan with O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,500
and we're here at Jupiter Con in New

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,980
York City and I have pleasure of joining

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,320
us here

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,000
dem ba ba as assistant professor of

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,900
electrical engineering and biomedical

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,330
engineering at Harvard University and

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,340
Deb and I were just talking really

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,820
looking forward to your keynote we were

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,019
talking about the theme of using Jupiter

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,430
almost as scaffolding I think is what

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,099
we're saying but where people can get

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,090
the confidence to jump into this kind of

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,460
computer science you know a real

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,930
technical type of tooling but without

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,120
that technical background necessarily

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,829
absolutely absolutely how is that

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,930
working out how is that been set up at

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,210
Harvard first of all it's great to be

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,440
here Paco and especially for somebody

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,719
like me who comes more from an academic

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,309
background but I'd like to be part of

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
these communities so it's it's great to

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,789
be here and to be having this

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,329
conversation with you so house has that

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,980
been going it's been going great so I

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,230
came at this from a very very selfish

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,719
perspective so essentially in the sense

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,049
that so when Jupiter started coming

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,119
around at just finished grad school data

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,860
science had started becoming hot right

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,390
and I was trying to get into this and

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,799
coming at this from like a non CS

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,500
background these are not tools that we

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,119
were traditionally taught and basically

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,979
what I did is when I started my position

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,840
at Harvard I was like hey wouldn't it be

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,159
nice if I could teach to the students

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,500
the kind of class that I would have

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,720
wanted to be taught and Jupiter was a

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,790
perfect plugging into that and it's

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,549
essentially what you said so for people

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,990
that do not come to data science or

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,549
programming from a traditional CS

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,110
background there's a certain amount of

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,119
inertia that comes from the fact that a

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,979
lot of things need to be done before you

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,079
can actually get decoding setting up an

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,939
environment figuring out dependencies

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,500
and so forth so what we've been trying

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,540
to do at Harvard and myself in

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,710
particular is how do you essentially

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,899
build that infrastructure for the

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,210
students to essentially make them relax

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,000
to the process at the beginning using

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,130
that as training wheels and after that

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,570
they just run with it and now show great

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,820
examples of things some of the students

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,950
have done just because they gain that

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,880
confidence you know it is expensive to

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,000
be able set up this kind of

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,280
infrastructure for students so so so it

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,470
costs us believe it or not and this is

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,710
the most surprising thing to me so we've

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,050
done

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,930
some numbers so the first time I

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,240
presented this we had an iteration where

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,980
we were using docker and we had this

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,390
problem of scaling up and down I think

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,220
you and I had talked about this right

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,570
and our engineers have been working on

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,420
this and they figured out a system where

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,120
now we're able to deploy machines on AWS

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,000
on-demand and for a class that I taught

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,770
last semester for an average of 30 hours

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,290
a week spent by a student on the

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,990
platform this cost us three dollars for

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,030
the whole semester that's the amazing

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,910
part what lesson you're probably paying

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,950
for a phone like a cell phone absolutely

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,360
that's the amazing parts and and for

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,950
that you're getting access on a cluster

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,880
be able to run some sophisticated

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,260
machine learning sensor yeah so the

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,180
basic thing you get for this as a

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,190
student say who's in my dev science

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,410
decision Theory class right is you get a

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,690
machine on Amazon with four gigs of RAM

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,720
a pretty good processor and sometimes

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,360
even more than one processor and so it's

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,060
essentially a cheap laptop that you have

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,670
on demand that runs Jupiter and you have

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,640
access to a terminal so if you're savvy

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,170
you can essentially do whatever you want

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,000
wonderful well yeah what what kinds of

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,730
projects are our students working on

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,190
with this so so the the most interesting

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,750
one and it's a shame that I won't be

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,850
able to talk about it at length tomorrow

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,040
during the keynote but add an undergrad

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,080
who took my undergraduate level class so

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,940
it's engineering science it's 155 and

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,010
it's biomedical signal processing but

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,480
what I call it is labs in the world okay

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,950
so the idea is the following the idea is

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,890
that we're going to give the students

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,060
wearables so let me step back for a

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,820
second so the idea is how do you make

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,800
data science real okay we're going to

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,540
give you wearables and I'm as an

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,520
educator I'm going to put together

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,740
assignments where your job is going to

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,720
be to collect data on yourself and I'm

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,210
gonna give you this platform where you

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,710
actually can upload the data and have

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,020
access to a programming environment that

00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,250
we set up in advance with modules that

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,160
we need to use and so forth for the

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,600
class and to this you're going to learn

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,950
slowly and slowly how to interact with

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,900
data so one of my students took this

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,430
class and ended up doing an undergrad

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,390
thesis with me so he started a project

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,590
during the class that was about

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:26,040
predicting the outcome of a basketball

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,470
shot perfect before it goes in

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,910
perfect like real-time analysis like

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,080
real-time analysis if you did not do

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,480
this in the class but he's only bad

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,300
thesis which he got a honorable mention

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,280
from our Dean as an undergrad thesis he

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,370
build the system from front to back and

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,020
this is a student who came into my class

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,780
yeah probably coated in MATLAB before

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,090
but never really really had any true

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,130
programming experience and this ended up

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,390
being he's only read thesis I mean this

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,580
this made me really really happy

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,500
outstanding yeah and that's a lot of

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,660
integration to do too I can imagine it's

00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,460
not oh absolutely absolutely I mean it's

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,830
from developing the part that actually

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,020
works offline to in this particular case

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,410
so the students name is Ryan Ryan Hassan

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,760
he built he got some accelerometers the

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,290
bare-bones sensors he sued them onto a

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,010
sleeve that a basketball player could

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:19,640
wear and he wrote the machine learning

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,770
algorithms to run on the hardware and

00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,390
had a deployment where essentially if I

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,220
had this device I could put it on and

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,110
take a shot and it would inform me

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,880
before the ball goes in whether it

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,080
thinks it's going to go in or not I mean

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,640
this is tremendous and this is in the

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,350
space of a year when you took my class

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,450
in the semester and in the next year

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,180
this was an undergrad thesis amazing

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,010
what what kinds of applications in I

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,770
mean moving beyond industry or sorry

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,530
academia moving out into industry or out

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,270
into government or out into what they'll

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,460
be doing in their careers later what

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,240
kind of applications get this type of

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:57,060
work open up so so this type of work is

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,370
in like this example in particular or

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,260
well and what you're working with in

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,850
terms of sensors and I mean be able to

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,920
build up accelerometers and all kinds of

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,770
sensors on clothing I can imagine have a

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,200
lot of practicality in different

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,920
settings whether it's medicine or

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,450
industrial absolutely absolutely but the

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,400
fact that you're getting students who

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,380
aren't necessarily computer scientists

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,990
and they're looking at applications now

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,000
and they're being enabled how can they

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,240
take that out into the world in terms of

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,650
other types of applications so so that's

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,360
that's an interesting question so so my

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,620
philosophy on this is so in the case of

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,230
Ryan and particularly this is a great

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,240
example I think the reason Ryan pursued

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,410
this particular project was that he was

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,170
on the football team he's a varsity

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,670
player

00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,500
and he's played basketball at the high

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,510
school level so what I try to encourage

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,100
the students to do is hey this is the

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,400
class and this is what we've got to play

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,740
with signals biological signals but I

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,690
want you to carve for yourself something

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,100
that matches your interests because it

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,450
keeps the engagement but in terms of

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,460
applications that I think this could

00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,880
enable one of the ones that's really hot

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:04,150
right now is sports analytics and smart

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,910
sports monitoring and sensors more and

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,380
more teams in the NFL in the MLB are

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,900
actually leveraging these kind of things

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,390
so now you're talking about not

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,970
necessarily having to make contributions

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,470
on the machine learning and so but

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,780
there's a need for folks that say have

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,000
an understanding of body physiology that

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,850
will now go after undergraduate work for

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,830
companies and that now have these skills

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,990
hey we can actually build a system that

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,790
works with this but I mean one thing

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,340
you're alluding to is that I don't think

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,590
this is by any means so this is not

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,810
meant to replace say formal training in

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,610
machine learning or in computer science

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,710
and programming it's more straining

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,330
wheels and then letting the students

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,270
decide is it something I want to pursue

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,290
further so sports analytics is ones one

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,820
that you mentioned that's really

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,660
important and that's getting a lot of

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,400
attention now is a healthcare monitoring

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,580
so you see a lot of hospitals for

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,340
example that want to be able to track

00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,870
the health of their patients while

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,980
they're not in the hospital because this

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,570
means you have to pay more when they're

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,940
in the hospital right right so our

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,460
patient says elderly somebody who's

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,410
getting older and maybe they're having

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,150
troubles walking or they might fall I

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,850
think that this and another one that's

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,830
that's really interesting to me that

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,630
even is not related to sensors is smart

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,670
cities a lot of cities are talking about

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,080
this in fact I'm trying to get a

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,550
partnership started with the city of

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,260
Boston to essentially help communities

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,910
take ownership of decisions that are

00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,590
going to be made about them so you have

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,000
a lot of data collected for example

00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,890
about traffic conditions in certain

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,930
neighborhoods pollution and so forth and

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,150
decisions are being made at city

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,350
government level at the state level as

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,380
to what kind of infrastructure to build

00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:47,260
and now you have so it would be great if

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,140
you can you could train undergrads who

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,629
say wanted to a career in that role to

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,389
have an understanding of

00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:57,970
programming data because this is being

00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:59,829
used more and more to make decisions at

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,600
very very high levels and we're not

00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:03,399
training we're not training the students

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,529
that come out with this tool set to be

00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,180
able to take advantage of that yeah now

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,300
given the kind of pricing and all -

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,430
we're talking about here US cities New

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,990
York Boston etc but what if we take this

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,329
out in the rest of the world I mean

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,279
given that kind of price point of

00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,930
somebody doing really interesting work

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,809
but for like three dollars a month for

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,209
the computer infrastructure what what

00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:26,139
can that do out in the rest of the world

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,149
yeah that's that's that's a great

00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,519
question so I mean I'll take the example

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:34,059
of so I was born in Senegal so I'm

00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,259
originally from West Africa and some of

00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:39,279
the kind of problems that this could

00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:40,990
solve is wealth distribution so you have

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,790
the government that has trouble actually

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,899
collecting data from communities that

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,759
are far away and that do not have

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,279
necessarily access to big cities where

00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,279
decisions are being made right so now if

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,750
we if we build this into sensors where

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,639
the community is connect so you have

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,019
local people so decentralize this and

00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,819
you have local people that are able to

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,500
collect data about hey what does the

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,600
community you think about issue X Y & Z

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,980
right all of a sudden if you're able to

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,250
build a portal where these data are

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,930
gathered right and you have smart kids

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,819
18 19 20 they're interested in

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,639
interested in data right this can

00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:19,809
dramatically shift decision-making at

00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:22,449
those particular levels and I mean other

00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:24,579
interesting examples for example are so

00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:28,240
potentially a controversial topic but

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:30,519
policing right and I mean you have

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,050
cameras that are on board everywhere

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,420
everybody has a smartphone and things

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,579
like that right so not directly related

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,069
to the developing world right but this

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,319
is an example of traditionally data are

00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:44,350
not being used to understand these kind

00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:47,800
of problems we that's today when you

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,329
talk about IO signals sir I guess we're

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,149
saved by those signals or biomedical

00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:54,730
signals yeah but just what we're getting

00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,980
out for our smartphones is that also a

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,470
kind of passive signal that can be used

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,529
oh absolutely absolutely so so I mean

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:05,050
I'm an Android so and I hack around with

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,000
my phone a bit so this has accelerometer

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,269
in there right I mean pretty high rate

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,120
accelerometers so and some of them

00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,380
actually have sensors that potentially

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
can capture things about temperature

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,660
body temperature so now you're talking

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,540
about decentralized health monitoring

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,730
for the developing world so this is a

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,399
very interesting story so so if you go

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,350
to Senegal so it's I mean it's it's a

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,839
developing country so in most rural area

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,730
it's a very poor country but I don't

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,589
have a phone that costs as much as an

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,950
iPhone 7 but you'll have places where

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,750
people have very sophisticated phones

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:43,329
there that are essentially being used

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,680
just to make phone calls and imagine

00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:48,540
using the sensors that are already

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,709
onboard or having sensors added to those

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,300
that could be used for health monitoring

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,279
so I don't remember the name of the

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,290
device but this is a very very cool

00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,760
device being built of the size of a

00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,589
phone actually think it's a phone to

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,269
take ultrasound images so ultrasound

00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,519
imaging is one of the cheapest way we

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:06,579
know now to acquire images about the

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,829
body capture soo remote without having

00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:10,899
have yeah a lot of yeah remote remote

00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,940
and what makes this really interesting

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:14,380
to me and which is why I don't have a

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,360
very good concrete answer to your

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,950
question is the following so I typically

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,450
find and this is why I tell my students

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,890
do a project that's related to your

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,950
interest because once you put the

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,470
technology there you will see that

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,940
there's problems on the ground that

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,680
people are interested in solving and

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,200
once you enable them with the technology

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,630
you will slowly see where this is

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,040
leading them I think it's one of the big

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,350
ways I think rather than being like oh

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,880
hey we should do X Y or Z you label them

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,130
with the technology and the tools teach

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,630
them the basics and people will just

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,920
start running with it yeah and it sounds

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,420
also enabling them through their

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,579
passions absolutely what they see

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,440
absolutely yeah wonderful well we're

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:51,970
really looking forward to keynote yeah

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,350
thank you I'll get her much more about

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,180
what you work on there absolutely thank

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,180
you yeah yeah great thanks a lot bigger

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,320
