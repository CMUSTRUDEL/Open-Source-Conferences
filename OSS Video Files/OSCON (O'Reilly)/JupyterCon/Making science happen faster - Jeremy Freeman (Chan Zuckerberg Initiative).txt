Title: Making science happen faster - Jeremy Freeman (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative)
Publication date: 2017-08-25
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Modern biology is evolving quickly, but if we want to make our science more robust, more scalable, and more reproducible, the major bottleneck is computation. Jeremy Freeman offers an overview of a growing ecosystem of solutions to this challenge—many of which involve Jupyter—in the context of exciting scientific projects past, present, and future.

cool thanks so much I'm so excited to be

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,980
here as I think Fernando said yesterday

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,080
this community is literally the

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,670
intersection of open source and open

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,920
science which are two of my favorite

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,320
things so it's so exciting to be here

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,949
and it's such an amazing conference as

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,670
Fernando also just said I did recently

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,910
make a really big jump in my life up

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,320
until about a year ago I was running a

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,420
neuroscience research lab at this

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,520
incredible Research Institute Genelia

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,590
and my lab was focused both on

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,390
neuroscience research but also in

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,250
developing computational tools and

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,870
software for the analysis of

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,170
neuroscience data and making all of

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,620
neuroscience more collaborative about 10

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,300
months ago I left Genelia to join the

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,969
Chan Zuckerberg initiative for science

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,739
and here is Cori Bargmann who is the

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,440
president of Chan Zuckerberg science

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,899
making the announcement that so inspired

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,309
me that I left at the opportunity to

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,219
join this incredibly exciting new

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,019
initiative so as Fernanda said this is

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,659
an initiative founded by Mark Zuckerberg

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,600
and Priscilla Chan and the goal of our

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,850
work in science is to support basic

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,280
science and technology that will make it

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,439
possible to cure manager prevent all

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,180
diseases by the end of the century and

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,369
if you're sitting there thinking that

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,710
this is a totally crazy and impossible

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,820
objective I would probably agree with

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,920
you it is really ambitious um what I

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,689
would ask is to have you think about

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,840
whether if I said we're going to achieve

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,060
this in a thousand years you might think

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,530
it's more realistic you know and that's

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,090
maybe makes sense science has done

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,310
incredible things in last 1,000 years

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,009
and it might be possible to do this in

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,350
the next 1,000 and if you believe that

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,810
then the question is really how do we

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,750
make a thousand years of progress ten

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,920
times faster and for that reason a lot

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,090
of what we're thinking about especially

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,009
right now at the start of this

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,920
initiative is what are tools and

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,810
technologies that accelerate all of the

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,430
work that scientists do what are things

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,590
that make all of science and all of

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,429
biology more efficient more effective

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,709
more scalable and more collaborative and

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,420
as everyone in this audience knows a

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,830
really important way to or a really

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,320
effective way to accelerate a fee

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,180
is through software and computational

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,550
tools that make the work that everyone

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,920
is doing faster and more effective and

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,540
more efficient and that's a lot of the

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,090
focus of the initiative as a whole and

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,070
especially the work that I'm involved in

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,720
the fact that as a philanthropy we're

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,730
also involved in actual software

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,740
development is I think one of the most

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,810
unique and exciting things about this

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,360
organization so on the one hand as a

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,060
philanthropy we fund science the left

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,890
hand side of this but we also do open

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,090
source software development and a lot of

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,650
what we're thinking about is how do we

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,050
do these things together and combine

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,900
them in a way that maximizes the

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,400
potential impact of our work so it's

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,320
been super exciting to get started there

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,390
at CCI again I've been there for about a

00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,430
year partly because we're new we

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,410
recently did a reddit ask me anything

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,320
which was kind of an unusual and

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,210
interesting experience and one of the

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,710
questions we got early on actually is a

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,700
pretty good outline for what I wanted to

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:14,400
cover in this talk so during the AMA

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,470
Toobin stamp said hey Jeremy and anyone

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,940
else you've been working on open and

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,860
reproducible science for the last few

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,200
years what are your biggest takeaways

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,690
are the challenges more social or they

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,850
technical once all scientists are

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,100
writing Jupiter notebooks what do we do

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,480
then so first of all I love the idea

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,420
that all scientists are gonna be writing

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,950
Jupiter notebooks I I think we could get

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,900
there and if we do it'll really be due

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,280
to the work of everyone in this

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,170
community and a lot of the people in

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,990
this room so that's a super cool

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,360
ambition I do think once we get there

00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,460
there are still some really significant

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,050
challenges and opportunities in this

00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,240
world of sort of open source and open

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,100
science where there are chances to make

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,380
really big progress and also big

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,660
problems to solve and what I wanted you

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,280
today was I share with you three

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,050
examples of areas that I've been

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,760
thinking a lot about and the context of

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,400
the work I did at Genelia but also we're

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,720
thinking a lot about now at CGI in terms

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,820
of areas where we might have an

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,390
opportunity to make real progress in

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,970
this space and first one sort of the

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,209
most fundamental is the basic problem of

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,970
analyzing data and the real challenge

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,520
here to me is that modern biology is

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,810
just super complicated the kinds of

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,510
experiments we do are incredibly

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,800
complicated and is an example of that

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,380
this is the kind of work that I was

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,140
doing a Genelia this is an experimental

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,300
setup where we have this Mouse on a ball

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,880
and the ball mouse is running through a

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,590
tactile virtual reality environment so

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,120
she has walls on either side of her and

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,950
in front of her and the walls are moving

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,020
around on little motors to create the

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,480
experience of walking through a virtual

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,620
corridor is shown on the right now the

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,710
reason we're using this virtual

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,960
environment is that because her body is

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,540
stationary we can use this giant

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,070
microscope on top of her head to watch

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,290
patterns of brain activity while she

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,820
explores this virtual environment and we

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,770
can capture that brain activity in the

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,900
form of images like this one or movies

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,480
where each of these little tiny flashing

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,100
lights is the activity or corresponds

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,480
the activity of a single neuron

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,890
so we're simultaneously watching the

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,720
activity of tens of thousands of neurons

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,790
while this animal explores an

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,710
environment so this is super cool

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,810
science but it generates really

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,670
complicated data and it's not just the

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,930
size of the data though it is large it's

00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,670
really the complexity you have these

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,770
images you have them vary over space and

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,540
time you have behavior you have all this

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,880
kind of complicated heterogeneous stuff

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,550
you have to put together to understand

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,680
the system so the good news is that we

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,260
do have a lot of tools that we can use

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,840
to analyze this data and sort of

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,730
understand it and structure it one of

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,560
those tools is Jupiter and in fact

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,630
here's a picture of Nick stephania of

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,580
who led this work and my group and here

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,080
he is at the microscope with a Jupiter

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,970
notebook where he's analyzing the data

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,980
basically in real time as it comes off

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,780
the microscope to try to understand what

00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,790
this mouse's brain is doing while it

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,170
explores this environment so it's super

00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,060
cool that we have these tools and we can

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,210
use them there's really in this

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,770
community and ecosystem of tools for

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,660
analyzing this kinds of these kinds of

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,240
data and this is not just sort of

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,860
neuroscience imaging microscopy and

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,930
related tools are really widespread

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,730
throughout all biology and we have this

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,680
great ecosystem of open source tools

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,170
that are really powerful for looking at

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,760
these kinds of data I think the big

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,950
challenge right now especially in this

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,110
community is that despite having all of

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,180
these tools the actual sort of day to

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,150
day experience of your typical biologist

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,000
is still pretty complicated so this is a

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,520
screenshot from a grad student in my

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,499
group who was literally just doing data

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,419
analysis one day and I took a screen

00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:46,870
so on his window Davis has

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:48,759
simultaneously open terminal that's

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,680
actually connected to a spark cluster he

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,689
has a Jupiter notebook and he has a

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,360
whole bunch of pretty complicated custom

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:57,219
microscopy software that he needs

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,860
because it lets him really interactively

00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,719
and really quickly explore his data so

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,520
Davis is using all three of these tools

00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:05,610
ones running in Python ones running on

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,439
the JVM actually two them around the JVM

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,169
all simultaneously and in a somewhat

00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,270
haphazard way and this is sort of the

00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,439
current state of the ecosystem and I

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,180
think it's really cool that all these

00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,610
tools exist but they're also huge

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,599
opportunities in terms of usability and

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,509
interoperability

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,599
to basically make Davis's life easier so

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,319
that Davis can spend more time doing

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,689
experiments and collecting all this

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
incredible data and less time sort of

00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,110
turning the crank on the analysis which

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,319
right now still occupies a large

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,969
fraction of his time so that's something

00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm super excited to be thinking about I

00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:40,870
think the answer is definitely going to

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,999
involve Jupiter it could involve Jupiter

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,930
lab which we've all heard about now and

00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,909
is super exciting

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,979
it'll probably involve new tools as well

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,229
and a lot of what we're thinking about

00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,909
at CCI is how do we bring the right

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,860
people together to build and improve

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,180
these kinds of technologies and I think

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,279
it's really going to be important for

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,349
this to be a collaboration between the

00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,819
software engineers we have at CGI but

00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,649
also the biologists are actually

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,419
collecting the data computational

00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,370
scientists that are thinking about sort

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,779
of what these tools should do and then

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,580
hopefully the kinds of people in this

00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:12,039
room that are building incredible tools

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,300
that support open science and these

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,319
kinds of novel data analysis

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,270
applications that theme of collaboration

00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,110
is the second thing I really want to

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,669
highlight because it's something we're

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,249
thinking about a lot in terms of how to

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,389
support better collaboration in science

00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:27,459
as a whole because we think it's a

00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,469
critical way to move science forward and

00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:31,060
move it forward faster and we're doing a

00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:33,219
lot of this thinking in the context of a

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,260
large-scale science project called the

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,300
human cell Alice so this is an

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,669
international effort it's much bigger

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,740
than just CGI CGI's one of one of many

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,079
groups trying to support it it's an

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,110
effort to systematically characterize

00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:49,089
all cells in the human body now the

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,459
reason this is such an important and

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,860
needed endeavor is this amazing thing

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,490
about biology which is that in your body

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,250
despite

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,770
every cell having the same DNA having

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,839
the same genetic program every cell ends

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,910
up doing something totally different so

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,010
the neurons in your brain are completely

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,660
different than the muscle cells in your

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,850
heart which are completely different or

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,430
rather different than the muscle cells

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,540
in your arm so all cells same DNA but

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,700
they end up doing very different things

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,980
and we want to understand and

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,630
characterize and systematically map the

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,910
diversity of cells across the entire

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,700
body and that's going to require a wide

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,839
variety of methods I'm including both

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,970
sequencing sort of genomic sequencing

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,529
techniques as well as imaging methods

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,089
like the one that's being depicted here

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,890
to show just the incredible rich

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,490
complexity of cells and how they're

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,980
organized in tissues CGI is really

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,270
excited to support the development of

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,190
this resource and we're doing that in a

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,690
couple different ways a couple different

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,360
ways that actually are starting to

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,029
include Jupiter so one of those is to

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,100
build a data coordination platform that

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,630
can support the hundreds of labs all

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,610
over the world that are going to be

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,800
generating all this really complex an

00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,440
enormous theta for the purpose of

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,940
mapping all of these cells and this is a

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,740
platform we're developing again our

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,630
software engineers are collaborating

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,579
with software engineers and

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,339
computational biologists at three

00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:11,589
leading research institutes EBI broad

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,120
and UC santa cruz and we're working

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,800
together to build a platform that will

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,649
make it possible for the hundreds of

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,829
labs all over the world ingest data into

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,839
this system make that available in cloud

00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,579
storage and make it widely available as

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,190
openly available to as many researchers

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:29,320
as possible we need to analyze all of

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,290
that data as it comes in and apply

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,970
standardized reproducible systematic

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,800
well-defined analysis pipelines to the

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,230
data as it arrives and then ultimately

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,029
make it available to everybody else and

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,130
I should say in building this platform

00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,860
and in this project as a whole we are

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,380
really building on top of the many great

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,640
successful large science projects all

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,440
the way back to the human genome for

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,180
example as well as some really amazing

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,680
projects in physics what we're trying to

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,800
do with this platform is sort of a

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,190
reimagine today I think in many ways for

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,329
the first time what a modern cloud-based

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,250
open-source

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:04,810
very modular extensible version of this

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,459
kind of data coordination platform would

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,700
look like and we're super excited to be

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,680
developing it

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,020
and we're also really excited by the

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,030
fact that Jupiter is starting to emerge

00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,740
as a really important player in terms of

00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,960
how people are going to be accessing

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,820
this data in the cloud and interactively

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,960
exploring it and analyzing it so a lot

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,420
of the groups were working with to build

00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,260
this are really excited about Jupiter

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,630
essentially as a front-end for this

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,520
platform and we're really excited to to

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,490
support those use cases

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,650
Jupiter's also shown up because in

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,560
figuring out which analyses to run on

00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,090
these data that green box at the top we

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,850
really need the entire computational

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,290
community to be working together and

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,760
developing new analysis algorithms and

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,740
figuring out which analysis algorithms

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,180
are the best and a really great way to

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,460
do that is to bring communities together

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,800
through things like hackathons and we

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,320
recently hosted one where we use Jupiter

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,180
hub to make it super easy for everybody

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,400
at this hackathon to be working together

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,380
in the same computational environment to

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,050
be iterating on hard computational

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,390
problems in both genomic and imaging

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,560
data analysis I mean working together so

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,840
you've already heard a bunch of examples

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,670
of how awesome Jupiter hub is let this

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,230
be another one but I really want to

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,780
stress this is changing the way that we

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,240
can organize and run this kind of event

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,500
and it's a super exciting use case for

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,420
me that's a good segue into the final

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,340
topic I want to touch on which is

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,200
sharing knowledge much more generally

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,770
and this is something that's been near

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,490
and dear to my heart for quite some time

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:36,950
the fundamental challenge here is that

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,150
science right now in general and this

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,030
this should not be a surprise to anyone

00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:43,490
here shares knowledge in a in a pretty

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,860
old-fashioned way so we're using a

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,470
technology to share science that you

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,760
could argue is invented by Isaac Newton

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,490
which is that we put all the science we

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,040
do into static documents that were

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,260
designed for paper and we share them

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,210
with each other before we do that we

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,090
send them to journals and it takes about

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,260
a year or often much longer before we're

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,900
able to share them and then people have

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,610
to pay for them to get access these

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,010
documents that we share they don't have

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,970
data they don't have code they're not

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:16,070
interactive they're not reproducible and

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,930
you know this is a huge opportunity to

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,120
really change the way and sort of

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,260
modernize the way that we share the

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,510
science we're doing

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,730
and make it easier to work together so

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,580
certainly everybody in this room is

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,680
thinking you know why isn't something

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,850
like the Jupiter notebook the format

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,900
that we use for papers and that's

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,180
something we're definitely really

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,740
excited about whether Jupiter notebooks

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,970
ultimately because of their

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,160
interactivity and their ability to

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,570
combine data and analysis they could

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,880
either complement papers or maybe

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,070
someday even replace them I think that's

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,050
a really exciting vision and actually

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,060
something I've worked on in my group at

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,850
Genelia and really Andrew Sharaf was the

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,740
person on my team leading this effort we

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,530
worked on some tools to make it easier

00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,960
much easier for scientists to package up

00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,430
their data and their code and put it

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,900
together with Jupiter notebooks in a

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,480
form that was really easy for anyone

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,430
else to get access to and that was a

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,820
project called binder and maybe some of

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,500
you have heard of at my binder org and

00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,260
this is something that was basically

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,940
inspired by a night that I went out with

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,490
beers for Fernet with Fernando and

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,350
Matias to come up with this concept we

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,300
built it really just as a prototype and

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,340
it sort of took off way more than we

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,400
expected which is often how these things

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,460
happen so it quickly sort of outgrew its

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,600
capabilities and I'm really excited to

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,730
be telling you today

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,090
that a binder is now more or less been

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,740
sort of adopted by the Jupiter hub team

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,320
and really thanks to the incredible work

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,000
of Chris whole graph and UV panda on the

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,700
support and work of Fernando Perez and

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,530
many others binder is now being

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,170
essentially rebuilt to run on top of

00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:53,510
Jupiter hub and the new version is going

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,280
to be much more scalable and robust and

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,650
and and freely available that's very

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,960
much the goal you can check it out it

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,490
baited up my binder org and I'm super

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,050
excited about this happening and it's a

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,960
wonderful wonderful way for the project

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,540
to evolve and the last thing when a

00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,010
highlight is touches on not just the

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,230
technical aspects of how we share

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,890
knowledge which are super important but

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,680
also the social ones and on the topic of

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:21,380
social sort of challenges to sharing a

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,450
big issue is just making it easier and

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,340
sort of more acceptable for scientists

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,800
to share more of their work earlier and

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,480
often and for the physicists in the room

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,490
the idea of working through these

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,200
journal systems is kind of crazy because

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,940
you all know about archive which has

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,070
been around for about 20 years

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,950
and the idea of archive is that instead

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,390
of going through this whole process of

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,160
submission and waiting for people to be

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,350
accepted you just post it to the

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,570
internet and then anyone can read it for

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,430
free as soon as you finish your work so

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,100
this is awesome it took a really long

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,200
time for biology to get sort of get this

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,820
model but it has recently through

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,410
something called bio archive which

00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,810
essentially enables the same thing for

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,700
the biology community and just in last

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,160
couple years thanks to bio archive and

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,320
its leaders but also thanks to the work

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,180
of advocacy groups like ASAP bio this

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,760
has really taken off in biology which

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,130
were super excited about and one of the

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,470
very first things that we did at Chan

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,510
Zuckerberg initiative was put support

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,610
behind bio archive and really is an

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,950
illustration of our approach to too many

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,830
problems we did this in two ways we have

00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,870
given a grant to support the team behind

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,790
bio archive help it grow help its scale

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,440
help their existing services but we're

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,450
also going to be doing software

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,400
development in the open collaboratively

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,530
with them to build new tools and new

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,210
features and new functionality to the

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,430
service that we view is really critical

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,230
and the super exciting movement within

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,240
biology right now and one of those

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,890
things among many could be and hopefully

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,720
we'll be finding cool ways to

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,130
incorporate Jupiter notebooks into the

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,680
way that Sciences are sharing their work

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,290
early in the scientific process on bio

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,000
archive so with that I just want to

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,470
thank you all so much and thank this

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
amazing community for such an awesome

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:03,670
conference and thanks to Fernando and

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,670
Andrew and I'll see you all around today

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,079
you

00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,079
