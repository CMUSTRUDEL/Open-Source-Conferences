	00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,069
today Fabi and I are going to be

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,639
presenting a project that we've been

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:11,009
working now for over a year and a half

00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,830
and it's this excel Python breach that

00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,740
I'm talking that that we mentioned so

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,080
I'm gonna be giving the overview and

00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,030
examples use case examples apart and

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,250
then Flavio is going to be doing like

00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,800
more in depth of the features and the

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,140
architecture on how we built this this

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,490
product so the first thing that we came

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,369
up is like you know what are we trying

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,839
to solve and and kind of like when we

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,570
started then it's like how can I

00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:38,789
increase the impact of data science at

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,559
large organizations the companies that

00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,329
we're working with and we kind of like

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,359
started looking and seeing ok how many

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,239
data scientists are in the world and we

00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,519
looked at some survey that Jupiter the

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,589
Jupiter team did and they kind of

00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:54,989
estimated that Jupiter youth space user

00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:57,569
base - like between tricks 3 and 6

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,489
million users and then we like started

00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:01,309
looking also then like ok who else in

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,809
the organization can be empowered with

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,549
using data science and we looked at a

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,619
lot of people that have been doing data

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,689
analysis for a long time those data

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,640
analysts business analysts at different

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,770
companies and we kind of like started

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,130
looking at how can we you know kind of a

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,409
size that market and we took a look at

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,329
like the most popular tool throughout

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,079
those that user base was actually

00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:27,240
Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Excel has

00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,140
like an estimated you know a hundred

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,789
times more users than Jupiter and so we

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,420
came out with like that you know if we

00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:37,920
you know can empower those Excel users

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,930
to leverage all the things that are

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,570
happening in the data science ecosystem

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,549
then we can help organizations you know

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,770
increase the impact that that's having

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,409
throughout them so we start exploring

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,149
what are the different you know

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,590
capabilities and the different skills

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,210
and the way they think about data

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,380
between those data scientists and the

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,539
business analysts so data scientists you

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,179
know use Python you can use things like

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,770
dupe and spark you know Jupiter is a

00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,749
very popular tool among the data

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,610
scientists they think our data in length

00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:10,769
terms of pandas dataframe for an umpire

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,560
race do you think about machine learning

00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:15,030
models and they can't deliver notebooks

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,980
and code and interact

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,990
visualisations when we took a dipper

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,910
LuPone like what business analysts

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,070
usually use and how they think about

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,100
data want to deliver we saw that they

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,830
frequently used Excel tools like tableau

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,870
and SQL and the rethought about data

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,060
like their spreadsheets database tables

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,520
and they kind of delivered those like

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,220
reports and spreadsheets and kind of

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,290
like interactive dashboards so we kind

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,090
of like you know realize how that this

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,520
business analysts were being left out of

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,280
the data science revolution that is kind

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,150
of like you know you know like

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,070
represented in the Jupiter and the duper

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,800
ecosystem and like you know overall on

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,000
the PI data one and so we're seeing like

00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,320
there's this kind of disconnect there's

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,180
all these great tools they're having on

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,510
in the open source but are not really

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,459
accessible to your average Excel user so

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,040
we thought we thought that we would

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,680
create this product that would connect

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,320
the two worlds and be a bridge between

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,600
those Excel users and those data

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,480
scientists during doing data exploration

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,060
machine you know machine learning models

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,090
exploring with Big Data and Hadoop and

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,340
spark and doing advanced statistics in

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,680
Python in Jupiter notebooks and so this

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,930
one we started with this idea that we

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,150
called anaconda fusion and kind of like

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,519
the base principle is that we want to

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,130
make sure that everyone keeps using

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
their preferred tools so a lot of people

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,250
is like empowering people that don't

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,959
know how to code and teach them how to

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,239
code that's a great idea but it's also

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,150
important to like meet them where they

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,160
are so one of the base principles of

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,810
design in this product this the business

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,250
analysts are going to be using Excel and

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,290
data scientists are going to be using

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,900
Jupiter notebooks how do we bring those

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,510
two worlds together and like you know

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,640
another part of that is how we can also

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,140
leverage all this like Hadoop and spark

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,150
infrastructure that has been set up in a

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,220
lot of large organizations how to make

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,540
also those business analysts that people

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,480
that know don't know how to code

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,859
leverage those that technology that's

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,479
already been set up and that like

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,419
companies have already invested large

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,880
amounts of money on it so basically it

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,710
also not just like should not also just

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,700
connect to a complain you know Jupiter

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,210
notebook but also have a larger access

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:36,170
to this you know ecosystem of this

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,420
really computing so that's part of also

00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,000
the this idea of sorceress big data

00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,980
analytics and so we've got we go back to

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,140
what the experience between this

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,000
business analyzing test data scientists

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,340
we also wanted to make sure that it was

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,040
stimulus for both of them so for the

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,830
this business analyst that's inside

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,870
Excel they get this excel add-on desk

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,430
that we call anaconda fusion and it's a

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,460
panel that comes up in your Excel

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,800
spreadsheet and basically the process to

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,750
do data science without using any code

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,020
is they upload a notebook or they

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,210
connect to one in this case this is a

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,070
standalone version where someone shares

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,320
a notebook with you you upload that

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,940
there's no book to this add-on and then

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,280
you get all the different functions that

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,320
exist in the notebook Inc even so like

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,510
what function you want to run and then

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,370
you're depending on what function is

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,350
like you get a different type of inputs

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,000
that's defined by the function that is

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,800
in the notebook and then they can also

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,380
select the input that can come either

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,270
from the Excel spreadsheet itself or

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,080
they can manually input it in the box

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:44,330
and then they could run and things have

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,360
been in their visualizations appear in

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,760
the add-on or data gets pulled back into

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,590
the Excel spreadsheet so this is the

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,230
basic experience for the business

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,510
analyst for the we also wanted to make

00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:00,290
it very easy for data scientists to be

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:03,500
able to create this this you know

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:06,800
customized experiences and in the

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,840
business analyst world so we it should

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,110
also be very simple for data scientists

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,940
to use this technology so basically we

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,550
defined just like as one line of code

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,960
one decorator then you put into your

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,330
function and that's it

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,280
so once you register that function with

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,100
Fusion it takes care of all the rest of

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,500
rendering the write functions in the

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,450
Excel add-on and also the right inputs

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,480
and the right types and make takes care

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,510
of like moving the types from Excel to

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,810
Python and the other way

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,930
so there's many use cases of this

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,620
technology like from allowing the

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,229
dishonest

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,960
we extract data from databases inside

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,720
Excel optimizing you know instead of

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,270
like doing manual SQL in like one place

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,150
copying data overhearing CSV files just

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,860
doing everything inside Excel also

00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,900
empowering them to do like machine

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,460
learning more other models or use the

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,220
ones that data scientist are creating

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,720
for them the kind of like self-serve the

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,580
other one is extending the Excel

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,620
capabilities around visualization and

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,560
empowering businesses to create more

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,289
interactive visualizations more complex

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,570
graphs that what Excel allows you to do

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:20,660
and then of course this connectivity to

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:24,350
Big Data that right now kind of very

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,350
hard and inaccessible to them so I'm

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,470
going to show three different examples

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:32,570
one is about running queries which is

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,360
something that business annals are all

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,250
very very familiar with doing the next

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
one is on machine learning models in a

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,430
little bit how they're you going to be

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,990
able to like self-serve in that space

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,810
and do like some exploration on their

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,430
own and the other one is like running

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:51,590
big data analytics are connecting to a

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:54,080
spark cluster so this first one is a

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,840
query so like basically you input us an

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,320
SQL query you click run and get data

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,330
back into your Excel spreadsheet so

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,930
pretty straightforward in this case

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,460
we're using the alignment database data

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,530
set I don't know if people are here

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,260
familiar with it it's a baseball one so

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,500
you can you know select like what are

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,229
the mineral average maximum batting for

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,949
a season you can also get salaries of

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:23,720
players so you can you know query to sum

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,289
of all their salaries and kind of order

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:31,250
it from minimal to like maximum salary

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:34,400
perm baseball player get they're like no

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,650
top salaries and things like that so

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,050
this is like an example that percentiles

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,120
kind of like get immediately because

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,820
that's at work so they are familiar with

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,320
so once we've set up this context we

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,600
show them what else would this tool

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,900
empower them to do in this case is

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,280
running a machine learning models so in

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,140
this case like the function is called

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,430
clustering so they see it there it's a

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,480
drop-down function if they wanted to

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,519
like perform

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,410
different modeling they could like

00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,620
select a different function there and

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,639
then you see inputs have data which can

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,920
be defined from the Excel spreadsheet

00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,779
itself we have two data sets when it's

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,360
called noisy circles the other one blob

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,610
and then they have a number of like what

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,470
algorithm they want to use and then the

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,320
number of clusters that they want to

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:22,010
group their data for this clustering

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,440
modeling exercise so let's take a look

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,839
in this case if when you click it just

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,089
put the default click run and you get

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,040
you know this visualization on how

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,630
things are group you can customize the

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,850
number of clusters I say like okay now I

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,100
only want two it's still not grouping it

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,380
in the in the right way so I can select

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,899
a different algorithm I click it and now

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,089
okay it has grouped the things the way I

00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:45,649
want them and at the same time I'm going

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,510
the results back into my Excel

00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,459
spreadsheet so this is really empowering

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,410
to business analyst even if they really

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,089
don't know you know what they're doing

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,860
with those clustering algorithms I leave

00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:57,170
them seeing the result and they can kind

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,660
of like iterate and it's like they can

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:04,040
also change the data set in the data

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,889
input the final example that I wanted to

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,430
show is one that connects to a spork

00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:13,370
cluster and uses the reddit data set so

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:18,170
it allows the Excel user to input a

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,730
subreddit do workouts and get a plot of

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,579
the words that are being used in that

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:26,899
subreddit all within Excel so in this

00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:28,699
case it's a spark notebook and you can

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:34,399
input in this case we do like the movie

00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:36,410
subreddit you click run and you know it

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,560
goes back well runs that distributes

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,940
custard and then comes back with the

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,430
frequency of the words that it has

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,470
counted and also this works out plot

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:50,779
that otherwise would not be able to

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:53,930
create in in Microsoft Excel so and they

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:55,670
can paste the results back so that they

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,269
can save that and share it with with

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,240
other people so with that I'll pass it

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,130
to Fabio to talk more on more details of

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,589
the features that it provides and also

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,190
the architecture on how we leverage the

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:19,440
Jupiter technology to build this

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:22,500
bridge thank you thank you for seeing so

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,530
before going ahead I just want to check

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:29,200
how many of you would feel more in the

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:43,540
business analyst site as a their daily

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:45,220
job today for Shai e15 right yeah

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,780
well many times people are in between

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,090
it's true so business analysts are

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,490
mostly people that like are working on

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,640
data and trying to figure out things out

00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,640
of that they they care more about the

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,490
business results

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,680
they're scientists are the people that

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,490
make it happen using tools like

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:13,840
notebooks or all the technologies to get

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:21,130
there so how many of you work doing data

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:27,310
science mostly ok ok how many of you use

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:33,210
notebooks as their everyday tool and how

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,210
many of you use Excel ok cool

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:45,070
so a couple of notes on the examples

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,650
fusion in the diffusion itself it it has

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,660
two components that in as UK we can see

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:53,110
the component that lives on the notebook

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,480
part analyzes the functions and see the

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,570
inputs and everything and generates the

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,630
UI for for Excel and the Excel user

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,300
would just they get the widgets and

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:09,130
everything on the client side based on

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,530
data types and and other things so the

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,020
whole idea is really to keep people on

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,910
their preferred environment so they can

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,570
keep working and caring about what I

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:22,889
care more most just a couple of more

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:27,089
examples about the outputs that we

00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:30,660
right on on the excel side this example

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,879
is the feature that we have that instead

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,679
of using the UI itself users can still

00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:40,889
go and use their the formula bar so in

00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,779
this case I select a notebook and they

00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:45,029
get access to the functions that were

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:48,480
exposed and on those and on this

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:53,069
notebook just like they would do in

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:56,809
Excel and they get results back and the

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:56,809
graphics on that side

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,940
okay so in this case basically what's

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:30,670
happening is users they are writing on

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:34,270
the formula bar that calls a function in

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,400
duper the notebook kernel somewhere it

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,980
executes the function getting basically

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,070
the Excel data as input and it returns

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:45,520
back the results if it's data it's being

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,560
written on on spreadsheet if it's the

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:53,560
graphics it's it's being written also

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:56,620
only only on the UI part this other part

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,600
is an example of writing back to excel

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:03,430
we kind of already saw that in the last

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:06,490
example but we can also tell Excel

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,410
fusion where to ride by default so it

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,670
doesn't overlap with stuff on the

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,670
current selection

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:31,010
and it also supports local plots and

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:36,330
other interactive plots so in this case

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:39,240
we show a famous graphic of an evolution

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,200
over some years and you can directly the

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,200
plots inside Excel

00:15:52,970 --> 00:16:00,620
last one as other kind of plots that you

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:04,100
can actually generate within the UI and

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,500
then copy back to Excel spreadsheet and

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,540
those can be basically saved with the

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,540
spreadsheet itself and be shipped

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,130
okay so as you can see it supports

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,950
pretty much everything that is supported

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:37,380
on notebooks the interactions with Excel

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:40,620
are limited somehow for a couple of for

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,480
a few things like interactive plots they

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,040
cannot be copied yet and stuff like this

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,410
mostly because of Technology limits but

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,390
everything that basically works on a

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:58,640
notebook should should also works with

00:16:51,390 --> 00:17:02,040
the infusion we started this project

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:06,829
basically to fill the gap between data

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,329
scientists and business analysts and the

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:13,010
the current solutions for this kind of

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:16,199
problem are very limited and we picked

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:19,560
Jupiter as a whole platform to work on

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:26,430
mostly because the technologies is

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:29,880
really great already and the current

00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:33,150
solutions they they do not they are very

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,670
limited in what in what you can do and

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,190
they're very limited and getting the

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,320
Excel users to work with something

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,500
because they need piping installation

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,800
other programming language knowledge

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,460
that Excel users are very hard to get

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:53,610
into so basically one that thing one

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,300
thing that we like a lot in Drupal and

00:17:53,610 --> 00:18:01,020
let's say is that it fills the gap

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:05,510
between domain-specific users like

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:09,540
scientists and computer software and we

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:13,320
we want to leverage on that open source

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:17,070
is a big plus for working on super as a

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,990
platform open source is like driving the

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,220
world right now so and it's getting

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,610
bigger and bigger

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:29,400
uber is a very mature and has a long

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,470
history before it was cool and before it

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,440
was

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:40,290
you know even a notebook itself the

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,200
diversity in terms of of the project in

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,810
terms of like projects inside Jupiter is

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,600
impressive and also the amount of

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,340
contributors that works actively on the

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,660
project it's huge

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:57,990
so you can take advantage of all that

00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:01,200
and also the vision and the openness of

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:05,040
the project the community and even

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,800
things their ongoing changes big changes

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,930
they all they always are a very open and

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,700
there's a really good timeline for

00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:16,650
things and that's very important too

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,670
especially when you consider doing

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:22,560
enterprise software using open source

00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:27,090
most of the problems of the enterprise

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:29,850
and open source are deadlines or when

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,550
things are getting out of beta or alpha

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,890
versions you know all those things and

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,720
being able to have a clear path and

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,530
communicate with people working on

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:46,050
things is very important and also

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:48,000
defining scopes where parts of something

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,220
that is changing are stable and other

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,690
parts are not so being but in the

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:56,930
meanwhile the overall project is

00:19:51,690 --> 00:20:00,660
considered not 1.0 that's very important

00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:05,220
and popularity is very important as well

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:09,420
Cooper is the major technology for

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:11,840
notebooks and sharing in interactive

00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,210
sessions and you know executing

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,540
out-of-the-box it's not going anywhere

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:24,840
so it's worth considering as a platform

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:27,780
to work on for us it was a very good

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,870
experience you can find a lot of good

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,360
things inside the drooper ecosystem if

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,340
you just check the repo those

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,010
organizations on github you see a lot of

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,830
repos with stuff that you can just use

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,929
it out of the box and they solve a lot

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:46,389
of big problems already

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:49,899
I already said that there's a great

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:54,279
community and support both inside github

00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:56,169
and outside and one thing to consider is

00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,489
also it's it's cutting edge technology

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:03,129
especially if if you consider using

00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:07,629
things that are coming soon with repair

00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:10,089
lab and that's that's very good and in

00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:12,549
one side because you use like the best

00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:17,080
that you can get out around and things

00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:19,799
that are really innovative but on the

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,389
other side if you consider enterprise

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:26,469
context that's very scary for an

00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:28,419
enterprise too so that's another thing

00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:30,399
that you need to consider api's might

00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:34,330
may change in the meanwhile while you're

00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:36,309
developing and if you don't work

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,889
considering those things it might be

00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:41,710
painful and another very good thing is

00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:45,309
that the whole rubric echo system is

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,469
very pluggable for for us it's it's

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:49,239
perfect in the sense that we can just

00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:51,460
use the pieces that we want we don't

00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:55,119
need to bring in a lot of stuff and we

00:21:51,460 --> 00:22:01,839
can bring more while pieces are getting

00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:05,409
more stable and that's what what we we

00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:08,409
did with fusion especially in the use

00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,809
case like this where if you if you go to

00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:13,299
stack overflow and ask a question like

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:16,149
about why I can't get machine learning

00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:18,190
inside Excel or stuff or you know how do

00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:22,389
i do things with pandas excel you've got

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,469
a lot a lot of ensures like you

00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:26,889
shouldn't be doing machine learning

00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:30,519
inside excel that's wrong but the real

00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:32,259
problem is that people needs that if you

00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:35,159
have something that is pluggable that

00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:39,570
you can just plug your Excel users in

00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:43,229
that's very important so taking a look

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:46,659
real quick at eugenic standalone

00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:49,989
architecture as a product it basically

00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:51,940
is a excel plugin well it has a excel

00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:55,419
plugin component that lives inside Excel

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,970
and there's a fusion server that

00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:02,210
basically

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:05,010
is just supports that and it's a bridge

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,679
that tells Excel where to look for

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,539
notebooks notebook servers and then

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,020
fusion connects to notebook servers

00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:16,169
check notebooks that are that have been

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:20,880
published or exposed to fusion itself

00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:24,419
and and then when an user select that

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,419
notebook it spawns a session with the

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,610
notebook server and then basically

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,400
everything else is just like you you are

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:36,539
used to do in your notebook what the

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,799
different UI so sessions are and kernels

00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:42,780
are shared between notebook and Excel

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,169
and Excel users can run the same

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:54,419
functions that that notebook user is

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:58,620
running on their notebook interface this

00:23:54,419 --> 00:24:00,419
is a fusion this kind of there's an

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,480
evolution of the product where we are

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:08,520
shipping a version assume with our

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:14,909
platform where this whole concept is a

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:17,760
bit more general we want we want users

00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:20,750
to basically be able to connect and use

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,150
the data use their models and everything

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:27,450
from everywhere so Fusion is in Excel is

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:30,000
just one of the clients of this whole

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:35,820
API so we're extending that the concept

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,929
to an API and and basically using the

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,600
same groundwork to connect people can

00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:47,210
users would be able to write their own

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,490
api's for own apps that use fusion api

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:58,020
from either on their legacy application

00:24:50,490 --> 00:25:03,559
or whatever client they want in in

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,559
general i miss wait

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:12,960
in general our experience working with

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,770
Jupiter as a platform for for new

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,580
technology has been very very very good

00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:22,290
we started evaluating one year and ago

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,770
the whole application everything by the

00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:30,030
time jupiter lab was very different from

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:33,330
what what it is now so we had to

00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:37,860
consider a lot of things and we decided

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:43,310
to go with more stable parts of the

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:47,070
whole notebooks infrastructure and bring

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:51,180
small pieces that have been declared

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:55,440
stable enough when they they were well

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:58,800
we were we're going a couple of things

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,100
that are necessary to consider since the

00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,560
beginning I think for anyone that wants

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,530
to develop their own enterprise

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:11,790
applications on top of this stack our

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:19,580
users licensing models limitations and

00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:24,270
stuff like this and I guess that's it

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:28,210
thank you if you have questions we have

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:35,589
five minutes thank you very much

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:35,589
[Applause]

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,010
yeah

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,150
yes so there's no there's no notebook

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,740
plug in for that

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:13,620
it's just you there's no server plugin

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,780
yeah there's only like Excel plug-in

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,090
outside of Trouper

00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,240
when you import it well you import

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:24,270
fusion and then from fusion you register

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,210
and that's enough for the Excel plug-in

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:42,440
to understand that those functions are

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:42,440
exposed yes yeah

00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:02,700
yeah somehow sort of of that there are

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,940
some more complications around

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:23,910
type-checking

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:28,270
and you know that's a good question I

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:31,750
would have said yes time ago now it

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:39,900
would say no it's not you don't need to

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:39,900
have executed before yes

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:57,200
the same anger at you

00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:00,050
the thing is the whole notebook is

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:13,700
shared between and that's pretty much

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:25,790
like any I think that use case yes but

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:28,130
it doesn't need to okay so well

00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,850
basically this is part of the plan our

00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:34,610
platform so the our platform

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:36,550
dysfunctionality is heard from front

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,830
platform itself so we understand

00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:43,280
understands who is sharing what with

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,550
others and and it can spawn the right

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,550
things

00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,709
would they need to have

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,410
so it's we have kind of like two models

00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,970
so like the first one is what we call

00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,800
the standalone model it was the first

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,810
architecture diagram and didn't like the

00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,640
desk use case so you would send you

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,740
would like send them the notebook and

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
taking like that's the first step they

00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,060
upload the notebook there when like so

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,630
they put it into like the Excel and then

00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,370
they execute but that's one in their own

00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,010
in their own laptop and then we have

00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,540
ways to like you have ways to like I

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,770
specify what environment you were

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,090
running when you were executing the

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,520
notebook so then we make sure that

00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,350
you're running the same environment and

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,080
then everyone is like running it in

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,850
their own laptop right but we but fusion

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,710
and I kind of take care of like make

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,700
sure making sure that the environment is

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,160
the same so that you get the same

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,320
results the other architecture diagram

00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,050
the one which connects to like a larger

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,020
platform then that doesn't have to like

00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:50,400
that movement of like a file doesn't

00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,590
that have to happen because everyone's

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,120
connected to the same platform so that

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,070
would be architecture number two

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,350
that's connective to them like so it's

00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,150
running in a server somewhere now in my

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:02,610
machine not in your machine my fusion is

00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,760
just connecting to that tension on top

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:10,050
of that like be having more question but

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,810
just a note on top of that fusion insert

00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,690
by the platform it doesn't even require

00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:19,020
a real installation on the user's

00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:22,190
machine it's just like where do I grab

00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:25,460
my fusion plug-in and that's it

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,460
so it's it

00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,750
you can use like your own yeah it

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,990
doesn't you know if you use your own

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:37,540
like you know get to like control your

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,100
versions like that's like that's pretty

00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,510
much and you like we don't enforce in

00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,390
like the standalone mode we don't

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,340
enforce any version control system are

00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,440
known on the platform that platform does

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,680
have there it's like it offers a gate

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,660
server so it does to version control on

00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,190
that and you can select what version of

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,660
the notebook you want to deploy to

00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:04,660
expose to the cure to your Excel users

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:06,490
we have questions currently yes but

00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,620
there's nothing preventing it from

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,730
supporting any other cleaner but that's

00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,730
where we started yeah

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,299
yeah so I think like the feedback we've

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:35,630
got we've been running on kind of like a

00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:39,080
free trial for now like yeah and we got

00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,940
over 8,000 downloads of fusion and the

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,279
feedback that we got is like they felt

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,659
very empowered like the firm the

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,710
business analyst perspective and because

00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:49,399
it's an environment they're already

00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:53,179
familiar with it's easy to get started

00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:54,620
to understand Python because they can

00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,990
see the results immediately in their

00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,320
Excel spreadsheet right so it also from

00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:02,600
the fusion of book you can open the the

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,270
notebook view and then you can like

00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,830
start writing small a code snippet so it

00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,870
also kind of like itself empowers the

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,070
business analyst to learn Python in an

00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,059
environment that they're comfortable

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,240
instead of like starting from scratch

00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:16,340
from a blank you know Python script

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,340
where they cannot see how the data is

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,440
manipulated now they can see the the

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,720
results of those like Python functions

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,130
small code snippets in their Excel

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,070
spreadsheet you can start making those

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,720
connections so we got a lot of good good

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,450
feedback from the business analysts the

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,240
the problem or I wouldn't say that but

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,950
the challenge is that for this product

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,980
to be success successful you kind of

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:42,760
need both both personas why you need

00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,870
like data scientists to start building

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,760
notebooks that have the fusion decorator

00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,500
to expose that functionality to business

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,940
analyst so we right now we kind of have

00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:54,860
a set of 12 notebooks that come by

00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,659
default with anaconda fusion that kind

00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,580
of give you a sense of the possibilities

00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:01,250
but now I think the chance more how do

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,230
we convince convincing data scientists

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,880
that did it the right way to deploy for

00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,250
the business analyst right so they can

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,659
start creating more interesting things

00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,099
so it's it's kind of bringing the two

00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,960
teams together and seeing how they can

00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:15,260
collaborate and I kind of seem like the

00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,909
the opportunities that exist in like

00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,770
from business to starting a I would like

00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,990
to see this and then like they kind of

00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,429
being very easily creating some scrip

00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,560
and like it's you know kind of like the

00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:29,399
back and forth between the two but yeah

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,639
thank you another question first

00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,639
yes

00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:46,270
yeah so the limitations right now it

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:50,410
uses the office three sixty three sixty

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:52,450
five technology so it's Excel 2016

00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:58,000
yes and above so it's a limitation on

00:34:52,450 --> 00:35:02,290
the Excel science yeah both Windows and

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,490
Mac yes yeah and yeah and the data flow

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:09,730
is both ways both ways and they think in

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,980
both ways one of the blue mutations that

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,290
the current technology previous

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,320
technology had is always the synchronous

00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:20,950
of communications between processes and

00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,990
processes and Excel fusion does not have

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:26,670
that and leverages on the extinct nature

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,670
of notebooks itself

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,920
so there's there's two kind of mode so

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,690
if you're just using the panel there's

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,819
like one of the pretty hard to see but

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,069
one of the toggle bars there is called

00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:58,319
our utter run so that means every time

00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:00,210
you change something in the panel the

00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:01,680
data would prefer get it gets refreshed

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,730
so you can set that to like

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,589
automatically to auto run and then if

00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:12,599
you use the formula bar we highlight the

00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:15,260
like a yellow bar so then you can edit

00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:18,720
like the same way that you do on that

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:21,240
one of the problem is is you may have a

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,520
function that is returning a larger set

00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,710
any overlaps with the input from another

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,700
function so you you have race conditions

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:32,970
between your input and your your output

00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:36,089
so in that case we we block there like

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:40,319
if your output is writing into an input

00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:42,770
area we don't we execute everything does

00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:42,770
it make sense

00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,690
no but ya know per se but it may be an

00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:30,140
interesting case like it may be

00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:33,200
something that we can evaluate yes you

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,880
would one of the big wins of this

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,450
approach is that you don't need to bring

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,520
your data in you you can actually you

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:42,440
get your data from Excel you only ship

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,440
the data that the inputs that you need

00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,480
all the computations like that's that's

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,100
the core of the spark cluster example

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,900
right the data is huge you're not

00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,970
bringing that data to excel you're

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,650
bringing your computing in the area

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,260
computation on the machine that has the

00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:01,750
data so it's fast and then you just

00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,750
bring in the results that you will need

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,280
yes

00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:32,030
so the first question was around

00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:35,630
permissions and basically yes the

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:38,530
platform version manages who can see

00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:45,710
what what I share with others the water

00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:47,840
question was about time take yeah so the

00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,130
standalone version has always already

00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,950
been released and we've been running

00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,440
like a free like trials so people have

00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,370
been using that and then like the

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,530
Enterprise version is stopped being

00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,140
released in September the one with the

00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:03,330
platform ok I think we're out of time

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:07,460
yes yes thank you thank you very much

00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,460
