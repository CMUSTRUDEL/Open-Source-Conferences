Title: The give and take of open source - Brett Cannon (Microsoft | Python Software Foundation)
Publication date: 2017-08-25
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Brett Cannon explains why, in order for open source projects to function long-term, a symbiotic relationship between user and project maintainer needs to exist. When users receive a useful piece of software and project maintainers receive useful help in maintaining the project, everyone is happy.

	00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,490
so the title of this talk if you look in

00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,040
your program is the give-and-take of

00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,740
open source potentially more appropriate

00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,419
title is setting expectations in the

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,740
participation interaction with open

00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:15,099
source projects but that's really really

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,170
wordy lovey gives you an idea of roughly

00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,400
want to be talking about today but to

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,780
start off I should kind of give my bona

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,580
fides you know where I'm kind of coming

00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,350
from touchy with the amount of

00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,480
scientists in here I should give advice

00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,340
upfront so I'm gonna developer at

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,140
Microsoft designer said I work on the

00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,539
same team as the team that overrides the

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,030
free Jupiter notebook hosting on Oprah's

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,649
Azure calm I'm also one of the Python

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,100
core developers I've been on the team

00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:41,079
now for just over 14 years so not quite

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,600
as long as Fernando working on ipython

00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,550
but almost and I'm also an open source

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,789
contributor in just the journal world I

00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,589
think I've contributed to about over 70

00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,940
projects now where I got at least one PR

00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:55,149
in and I'm not one of the maintainer x'

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,639
to which were actually Jupiter and

00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,739
Jupiter no plugs itself now I'm gonna be

00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:01,389
talking here mostly as a maintainer of

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,339
various open source projects but also

00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:06,130
ask attributer myself tried to just

00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:07,870
discuss where and how people can

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,580
interact with open source in a better

00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,980
way to help keep this wonderful movement

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,680
going and to make it just more touchable

00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,880
for everyone who participates but to

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,860
start we should probably define what a

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,420
little source project is because it's

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,000
kind of a term that we don't necessarily

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,560
think about deeply now I should clarify

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,050
I'm talking about open source projects

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,070
not open source code in my view

00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,600
basically the instance you start having

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,850
any kind of conversation with people

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,950
that instantly becomes a project and not

00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,900
code so the idea that open source to me

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,980
is just about the code becomes a fallacy

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,010
the instant you start talking with

00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,980
another person and to me an open source

00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,100
project is all about two things sharing

00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,260
in the maintenance of that project and

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,510
having fun because a lot of us do this

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,310
in our spare time because we enjoy it

00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,290
whether it's interacting with people

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,270
getting to know people learning what

00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,810
have you the fun part is really

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,340
important

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,440
now obviously the maintenance is also

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,550
there right like you wouldn't be working

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,200
on this project if you didn't want to

00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,500
help see it succeed and keep it using

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,119
and workable and going forward so it

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,260
basically ends up coming into bounds

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,240
between these two but they're both

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,080
really key because if you're just there

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,670
to maintain it

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,020
you're not enjoying yourself you will

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,660
burn out you won't want to participate

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,620
in look away you can just have fun but

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,790
if you're not helping maintain the

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,500
project it's going to wither away and

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,530
people are going to stop carrying so it

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,420
really is a balancing act and the way

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,970
you do this is with people and this is

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,130
where a tough problem and so how do you

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,020
sustain an open-source project and keep

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,460
people going well you basically have to

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,950
attract new people and you need to

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,140
retain the current people now attracting

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,640
new people basically is key because if

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,650
you don't projects will just wither away

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,780
as people fall away people stop

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,270
participating in open source for various

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,580
reasons changing jobs starting families

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,470
what happe it's all over the map but

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,390
people do eventually stop contributing

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,340
so if you don't keep bringing in new

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,730
people the project will eventually reach

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,840
no people and departure just dies you

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,100
also have to maintain your current

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,050
people though because they obviously

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,850
have the breadth of knowledge of how to

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,620
keep the project running bring new

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,390
people in onboard them and all that so

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,280
once again some real balance balancing

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,720
act here between bringing in the new

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,770
people making it welcoming but also

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,600
making sure that the current people

00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,880
don't get burned out and just walk away

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,470
too soon before they can keep the inflow

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,850
of people continuing to keep the project

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,900
running so in general firstly where this

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,820
all breaks down to is we need to work

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,860
together as a community to set

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,050
reasonable expectations so that open

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,180
source is enjoyable for everyone because

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,620
as I said if it's not fun and enjoyable

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,959
you're just not gonna want to do it I

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,900
mean really key thing here is when

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,000
working with these projects is they're

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,250
either volunteering their spare time or

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,170
someone's paying them but it probably

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,730
isn't you paying them to do this so we

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,920
really need to work on the symbiotic

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,900
relationship between maintainer xand

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,459
users and contributors so that everyone

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,620
feels like they're participating equally

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,050
and well together and that there's no

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,000
animosity anywhere because as soon as

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:05,040
anyone feels animosity for one of these

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,040
groups things just start to fall apart

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,380
and unfortunately we don't always do a

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,390
great job with this a good example here

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,040
Cory Benfield if you're from the Python

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,200
community you might recognize some of

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,459
the projects he leads such as your lab 3

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,040
and he's one of the core maintains

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,750
requests probably one the largest Python

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,950
project out there and back in November

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,920
after I actually had to take a month off

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,080
myself

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,760
burnout kori tweeted this of saying

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,470
quote here's a bit of Real Talk for

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,850
people I think working open-source

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,240
software has made me more bitter and

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,380
short-tempered and quote now I

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,810
completely understand this I will fully

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,750
admit this has happened to me ask my

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,640
wife unfortunately but this is a real

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,340
problem right

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Cori has a wife and if she ever came to

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,970
him and said you know I open-source is

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,770
literally making you bitter and

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,420
short-tempered

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,990
please stop who do you think Corey's

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:03,170
gonna choose his wife or open source

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:06,080
hopefully he's gonna choose his wife but

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,030
the key thing here is Corey works as the

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
lead maintainer currently of Europe 3

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,330
which is a real key project as it's a

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,820
base level of a lot of networking

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,860
projects in Python including requests

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,510
which he also is a core maintainer of so

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,710
if Corey suddenly burns out and walks

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:24,590
away that's a problem and so this is a

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,970
real issue and if you talk to any court

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,480
of any developer of any major

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,890
open-source project whether it's in the

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,150
Jupiter maintainer z-- I know Thomas

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,590
cause well from a plot lives in the back

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,200
room somewhere you can talk to him

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,730
various people from anaconda talk to any

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,650
of them and a lot of them will tell you

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,180
that they've all felt like this and so

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,800
it's a real issue that we really need to

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,930
work together as a community to try to

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,850
work through to try to improve because

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,930
if it continues we're gonna have a burn

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,940
out right that's going to be really

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,140
precipitous for these projects and

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,310
there's just really unfortunate so as I

00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,360
said the title of this talk is the give

00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,680
and take of open source because it

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,310
really should be a give and take right

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,600
on both sides so like maintain heirs are

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,510
giving out software and users just

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,430
taking it and users are giving back bug

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,680
reports and such and the maintainer czar

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,630
taking it it's very much this American

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,100
relationship of give and take back and

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,710
forth anything the really key thing here

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,940
that we sometimes lose sight of is when

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,830
you give something that someone takes it

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,450
you really need to be aware of what

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,010
you're taking to set proper expectations

00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,140
so you don't expect too much because

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,960
when you start to expect more than the

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,940
person giving you expects you to

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,650
basically expect there can be this

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,000
disconnect and it really leads to some

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,480
clashing because suddenly you're

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,860
expecting more than you're actually

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,100
being given and then people have

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,420
disagreements so I'm just going to

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,860
quickly go through some typical

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,300
open-source iñárritu trying to point out

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,350
where this tune is the fall apart now

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,700
some of you might be in the audience

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,530
thinking this is really obvious and

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,030
stuff but it really isn't for a lot of

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,230
people because if you really don't stop

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,240
and think about the way you word things

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,410
and the way you state things you really

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,470
don't quite realize the impact you're

00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,270
having on people so for instance using

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,550
open source right so as a maintainer I

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,740
happily give you source code that I've

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,020
written and produced to the world for

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,970
you to use that's fantastic you as a

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,730
user gets a ticket but you take it

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,990
without basically complaining that's all

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,690
I ask

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:18,920
don't yell at me more or less it because

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,060
really what happens is is you can really

00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,460
end up with some really negative

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,010
feedback phrasing really bad ways and it

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,040
emotionally honestly emotionally can

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,870
hurt right like you can write a blog

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,570
post where you just totally rant and

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,520
rave about Python and say oh Jesus why

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,290
the heck did they do that that is stupid

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,810
that is bad design

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,010
why why why but you know what that blog

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,110
post can end up in the front of hacker

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,240
news and then I get a hold of it and I

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,150
noticed it and I read it and so I have

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,130
someone basically calling me stupid

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,920
right I mean it really does get to the

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,360
core it really hits you hard and you

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,370
really don't think about it right it's

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,130
just my blog on my little website I'm a

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,660
little post but the net is very easy to

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,400
search and stuff percolates up whether

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,740
you expect it or not so it's all public

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,900
so something we really have to be

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,700
cognizant of right it's okay to say you

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,010
know I don't understand why they've made

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,270
this design decision or what have you

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,640
and that's totally fine it's fine to

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,190
honestly ask but making assumptions

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,750
really in assumptions that are being

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,790
negative can really be a gut punch and

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,090
it can also go the other way right like

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,310
if you come and provide feedback saying

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,020
hey you know I was wondering why you did

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,460
this or hey would it be possible to

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,510
potentially do this I'm thinking it

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,979
might be useful as a maintainer I should

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,240
be very respective of you taking the

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,370
time to think this through right and

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,830
propose and coming forward and putting

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,200
the effort in to give me feedback right

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,370
I shouldn't say that whatever just go

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,020
away you don't know what you're talking

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,280
about because that's really dismissive

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,840
and you've probably put in a lot of time

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,480
and effort and thought about things you

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,910
may have had conversations over lunch

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,620
their co-workers and really putting the

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,070
effort right and I should be respective

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,990
of that right and so once again it's a

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,660
symbiotic relationship of I'll give you

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,339
stuff you accept it great you've heard

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,740
me back I take it back and I accept it

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,060
great but everyone's very cognizant of

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,800
the fact that it's very much a

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,800
give-and-take relationship here and

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,600
there which is basically being nice

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,699
because it's very easy to forget to say

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,290
things like it's just my opinion and I'm

00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:23,740
just asking I'm just being very upfront

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,620
and just trying to be respectful without

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,440
just going yeah that's just stupid on

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,360
either side and this also comes from

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,170
contributors giving the maintainer

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,660
right like you might want to contribute

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,610
something like a pull request right

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,019
because you found a bug or you have a

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,880
feature or something you want to put it

00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,010
in well you also have to realize that a

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,720
lot of people are our volunteers and so

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,529
they have a limited amount of time so

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
they're gonna have their own priorities

00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,440
and they're gonna have their own needs

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,430
because also if they're getting paid by

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,139
someone they're getting paid to do

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:56,050
something specific which might not align

00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:58,120
with what you want and so you need to at

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,860
least take the contribution respectfully

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,360
and understanding that someone quite

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,209
possibly put in hours and hours and

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,160
hours of work into this and even though

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:08,079
you don't take it you should at least be

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,029
thoughtful and respectful and thankful

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,149
for them to at least care enough that

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,260
they wanted to do this so once again I

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:15,850
want to make sure everyone understands

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,380
I'm not putting blame on users or

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,510
contributors versus maintainers all

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,980
parties involved need to be respectful

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:26,500
with people and the same goes going back

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,970
to feedback on the contribution you

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,260
might make this graduation and I might

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,760
think oh I could have done that 10

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,010
minutes well you may have taken hours

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,990
but then again I've been writing the

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,940
core of Python for 14 years now and you

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,069
may have started less than a year ago so

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,380
it's being really cognizant once again

00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:42,279
of not knowing people's backgrounds and

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,410
where they're coming from and what they

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,680
put in and that's been really

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,910
understanding and able to really

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,800
basically once again work together to be

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,180
understanding of each other and where

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,740
people come from to be respectful and

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,839
this extends all the way to maintainer

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,029
is working with each other right like I

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,769
have personally had arguments with other

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,170
core maintainers on Python because

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,280
people have bad days right and sometimes

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,870
people get

00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,370
been out of shape over little things and

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,680
everyone just needs to understand once

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,050
again a lot of some volunteers there's

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,790
only so much time in the day and we just

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,660
need to be understanding that I might

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,850
not be able to get something that

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,490
someone else wants me to get to because

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:26,230
you know what I have a wife I have a cat

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:28,660
they take up time and so you really need

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,630
to just be understanding once again that

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,250
just because you might have ten hours a

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,990
week to do it or 20 or what have you

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,850
because you're still in grad school like

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,510
I used to be I don't have that kind of

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,410
time anymore so you just it's once again

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,610
understanding just being very respectful

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,850
of where people are coming from because

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:49,090
in the end we're all doing favors for

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,620
each other really we like to call this

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,600
is volunteering but unfortunately

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,650
haven't quite seem to have seeped in

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,970
well that volunteering really means that

00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,230
people are making our sacrifice because

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,700
when you think volunteering you think oh

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,590
I'm going to the soup kitchen on

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,230
Thanksgiving and helping the homeless

00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,060
get soup or something right that's okay

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm sorry pricing my time I giving it up

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,070
but no big deal there is a bit more of a

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,750
sacrifice I think going for it in terms

00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,940
of just time because people get very

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,280
emotionally involved with open source as

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,230
I said earlier when you say like Python

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,100
stupid I take that kind of personally

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,140
because you're basically calling

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,640
something I spent 14 years of my life on

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,890
stupid I mean it really needs to be

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,300
thought through that everyone's doing

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,100
favors for each other really in the end

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,870
right like I'm trying to do you a favor

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,820
by giving you software that I've written

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,310
you're trying to do me favors by giving

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,070
me feedback same thing with issues

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,660
reports for requests back and forth it's

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,700
all favors with each other and I would

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,650
hope that we can all remember what

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,600
favors are like like you're you're

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,360
trying to do something nice but don't be

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,890
too ambitious with you expect back and

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,360
but just be appreciative that's my least

00:12:53,890 --> 00:13:00,940
tried even if you don't take it and

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,610
lastly because I can't convince people

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,960
who are volunteers to necessarily do the

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,430
right thing I can at least talk to

00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,510
people who get paid to do this because I

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:12,070
can talk to your employer and if there

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,920
is one thing I think could really help

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,209
people when they do open source is to

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,010
really stop and think about what you're

00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,240
about to say because once again the

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,810
Internet's very public and it's very

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,569
permanent

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,569
and people don't forget at least I don't

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,649
so whenever you're about to do anything

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,499
online with open source to try to keep

00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,819
this whole give-and-take in perspective

00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:36,249
and everything do try to remember that

00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:38,110
you are basically going to be asking me

00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,249
a favor and vice versa so this is gonna

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,620
be a conversation and we're gonna be

00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:43,809
working together but really the critical

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,279
thing here is everyone's just trying to

00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,740
be doing favors for each other so just

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,970
keep that in perspective the thing is

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,309
assume your boss is gonna read whatever

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:54,249
you say you're representing your company

00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:56,800
and once again the internet doesn't

00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,910
forget so I think everyone wants to make

00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
sure their company has a good reputation

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,720
online because this has been a problem

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,430
I've seen before where companies people

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,259
work at a company say well I work for a

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:10,709
company X and so you should do this for

00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:14,499
me it's like no not with that attitude

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,029
and I don't forget other thing is you

00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:17,740
can just if you don't care what your

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,930
boss thinks maybe you care what my

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,220
parents think because basically if you

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,199
think it's gonna seem insulting to my

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,059
parents maybe you shouldn't say it to me

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,319
please

00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,149
and maybe if you still don't care about

00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,860
your boss or my parents maybe you care

00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:31,949
at least about your parents and maybe

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,759
you don't want to make it look like

00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:34,779
basically if you're gonna embarrass your

00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,730
parents you probably don't want to say

00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,470
it either so chances are either you care

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,139
about your boss thinks my parents think

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,370
or your parents think somehow so please

00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,720
take that into consideration when you

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,389
interact with open source projects

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,040
because really open source is fantastic

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,790
and I think we can all work together

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,620
very harmoniously and be able to

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,360
continue this contribution work going

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,629
forward so that we can continue to have

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,550
really impactful happy current

00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:02,550
contributions open source thank you

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,720
