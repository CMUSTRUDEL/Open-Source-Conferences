Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Traditionally, statistical training has focused on statistical methods and tests, without addressing the process of developing a technical artifact, such as a report. Hilary Parker argues that it's critical to teach students how to go about developing an analysis so they avoid common pitfalls and explains why we must adopt a blameless postmortem culture to address these pitfalls as they occur.
