Title: Opinionated analysis development - Hilary Parker (Stitch Fix)
Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Traditionally, statistical training has focused on statistical methods and tests, without addressing the process of developing a technical artifact, such as a report. Hilary Parker argues that it's critical to teach students how to go about developing an analysis so they avoid common pitfalls and explains why we must adopt a blameless postmortem culture to address these pitfalls as they occur.

so I'm Hillary and as you just heard

00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:13,080
there's my twitter handle so um so yeah

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,740
like he just heard I come from the data

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,740
science world I originally I have a PhD

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,860
in biostatistics from Hopkins but after

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,510
that I moved into industry worked at

00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,920
Etsy for a long time I'm sort of

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,100
bringing up my background because a lot

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,790
of this will play into my talk later so

00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,679
I worked at Etsy for a few years and

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,480
really enjoyed my time there I really

00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,280
learned a lot after that I moved to

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,070
stitch fix which has just been an

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,390
amazing place to work super fun if you

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,829
care about fashion you should totally

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,269
come work with us and I also have a

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,679
podcast called not so standard

00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,219
deviations that you should totally check

00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,379
out and finally I also I'm really

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,089
appreciated this is the this conference

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,579
was very open to our people so I'm

00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:02,039
definitely in the are world primarily

00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:04,140
and I feel I have a founding member of

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,060
this are cat ladies hash tag so if

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,390
you're ever using our and you have a cat

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,930
and your cats like on your computer

00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:14,990
please take a photo and tag it our cat

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,049
ladies and we'll we'll all like it so

00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:23,369
guaranteed likes cool so the idea with

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,439
this talk is that I have so this is a

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,950
tweet from I guess almost two years ago

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,789
now and at the time I had spent all

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,430
summer working going to conferences and

00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:37,380
hearing a lot about package development

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,030
so like our package development I don't

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,640
know how many people here like would

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,210
have gone to use our ever it's ok so

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,009
we're definitely not an art crowd here

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,840
so yeah like use ours I mean it's kind

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,429
of a unfortunately name conference

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,960
because it's you think it's about using

00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:54,990
our but it's really more about

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,060
developing our and so you know a lot of

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,700
the core developers are there and then

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,140
package developers and so and it's a

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,759
great conference to go to if you want to

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,179
know exactly what's happening and you

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,829
know what new packages to check out but

00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:10,409
I also walked away that like there was

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,700
also some stat conferences etc and I

00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,920
walked away sort of feel

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,250
like you know we're missing the

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,930
community effort around like doing

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,720
analysis like actually using these

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,819
packages and so we've come a long way

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,129
obviously in two years we're now like

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,510
we're at this conference our studio also

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,000
just had their first conference this

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,400
year and so I think there is like a

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,170
growing recognition that the people

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,510
using the software should have their own

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,580
community and sort of conferences

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,180
focused around it but two years ago that

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,650
wasn't the case and the way that I was

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,180
thinking about this was less about like

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,099
what conferences to create and more

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,340
about like what word should we even call

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,640
this like the idea of writing a really

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,400
good analysis didn't really have a word

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,099
and so I replied to myself and I said

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,819
yeah what about like analysis developer

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,739
any other ideas and so I obviously stuck

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,360
with analysis developer but I want to

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,220
take the opportunity to like shoot down

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,269
every other idea that came up in this

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,040
interaction so they were sort of like oh

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,790
is this different than a data scientist

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,650
and how many people here like hate the

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,350
word data scientist yeah I'm not I mean

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,540
I like I am I've come around a little

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,370
bit in that week all like scientists you

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,109
call someone a scientist and it's like

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,910
Oh what type of scientists and so I feel

00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,200
like data scientists there needs to be

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,819
like oh well what type of data

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,060
scientists it's like the idea of

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,549
applying the scientific method to

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,250
industry essentially but yeah I found

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:47,819
this to be an unsatisfactory response

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,920
because like this term is just like

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,780
ridiculously over use to describe so

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,180
much stuff and so this is one of the

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,639
first Google results when you googled

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,400
like data scientist and it's this like

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,590
woman who you know knows like all of

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,510
math and statistics it's kind of hard to

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,700
see but it's just like listing off like

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,010
all the sort of statistical principles

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,660
you need to know she also has like all

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,569
of the programming and database

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,370
knowledge so she understands like you

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,079
know how the data stored and how to

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,880
optimize and streaming data and

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,130
everything and then she also has all the

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,360
domain knowledge so totally understands

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,490
the application can sell it to business

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,889
with no problem and then finally she's

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,550
really great at communication too so

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,169
like nowhere in this list is it actually

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,150
like writing good analyses and

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,370
understanding the code for it so I

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,699
figured this term wasn't really gonna it

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,500
wasn't gonna like help at all so someone

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,650
else replied what about a reproducible

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,539
researcher which i think is a good like

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,360
it's in the right vein of what I was

00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:52,240
thinking about but my problem with this

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,189
is that reproducible is only kind of one

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,889
of the adjectives that we have for good

00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:59,529
data analysis and I actually feel like

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,449
for the most part they kind of fall into

00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:04,389
three different adjectives like you want

00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,279
analyses to be reproducible you also

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,840
want them to be accurate and then

00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,370
finally something that doesn't get much

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,439
airtime is that you want them to be

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,789
collaborative so if especially in the

00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,310
industry setting you might have other

00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:17,199
people who need to contribute you might

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,879
be delivering it to you know

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,979
stakeholders and you want them to be

00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,259
able to write questions and so that's

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,229
that's I think a really important an

00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,150
important factor

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,699
so then Hadley Wickham comes in was like

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,180
his star power and he's like what about

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,219
data analysis engineer and for this I

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,500
felt like you know the difference

00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:40,629
between a data analysis developer and a

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,779
data analysis engineer isn't really like

00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:47,529
that big so I kind of liken this like

00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:51,279
he's he like persist and not liking data

00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:52,629
enough data analysis developer and so I

00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,360
feel like I'm kind of like Gretchen

00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:57,610
trying to make fetch happen and he's

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,379
like Regina George just like totally

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,889
shooting it down and he's definitely a

00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:06,250
mean girl so it's like it all works out

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:09,490
but I I'm persisting and trying to make

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,779
fetch happen so and I really feel like I

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,029
don't know we talk about software

00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:14,740
developers and software engineers and I

00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:16,750
feel like we can talk about analysis

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,300
developers or analysis engineers and

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,810
like if we go with both like that's fine

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,370
with me the reason I like developer is

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,229
that I just feel like it captures the

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,259
process really well like you're

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,690
developing this artifact and I like the

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:34,780
idea I had to get a cat photo in here so

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,460
this is like my cat going from you know

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,220
cute little kitten too like this like

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,320
majestic creature and so I like the idea

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,050
of like something coming together and

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,419
like becoming mature so like developing

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,930
analysis is like getting it more robust

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,700
and more mature and then I like the fact

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,150
that you can think about multiple things

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,490
you're developing so you know I think

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,180
traditionally when we talk about

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:03,970
developing kind of like a analysis or

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,590
developing an argument there's a lot

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,990
around narrative and I actually feel

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:11,380
like most of data science training is is

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,270
very focused on narrative and so when

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm talking about narrative what I mean

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,200
are things like what models are you

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,370
gonna use like you know the assumptions

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,140
of the model and the results of the

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,730
model are going to be like key things

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,400
you're pointing to to convince people of

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,050
things there's also just like the

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,940
argument you're gonna make I mean I

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,410
think this how many people here do feel

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,380
like they do data analysis as their

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,690
career is it like a fair a fair number

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,220
so like this idea of like creating you

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,720
know you you figure out what story you

00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,090
want to tell and like the points you're

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,500
gonna emphasize and you run through a

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,880
bunch of graphs and realize like oh

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,210
that's the interesting one so I'm gonna

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,740
really focus on that so yeah like the

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,070
argument comes together during that

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,330
exploratory data analysis phase and then

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,830
yeah just like the whole like how are

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,240
you gonna convince your audience you

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,180
would obviously write a really different

00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,100
analysis for your CEO then you would

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,110
write for like your other data science

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,970
colleagues you would use different

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,930
language and make different graphs and

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,700
make different points so I don't want to

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,650
focus on that at all what I do want to

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,320
focus on is developing this like what

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,750
I'm calling a technical artifact and by

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:23,050
that I mean anything from like an email

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:25,600
or a slide deck or you know a PDF with

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,060
like a longer analysis or a github repo

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,850
with a Jupiter notebook like embedded in

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,469
it but just like whatever it is the

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,300
physical thing that is going to deliver

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,719
your insights and your narrative to the

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,550
people and so the questions here are

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,700
things like oh what tools are you going

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,560
to use to make this deliverable and like

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,839
what coding and technical choices are

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
you going to use for like producing this

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,480
deliverable

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,990
and of all those adjectives like which

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,940
ones do you want to check off and so

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,490
you're talking earlier about my podcast

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,110
I I was I've talked about this concept

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,360
kind of a lot on my podcast and my

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,880
co-host took it a step further which I

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,459
really loved where he kind of talking

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,020
about how mastering the statistical

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,089
tooling and getting really good at

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,070
creating these documents these technical

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,020
artifacts is very much like kind of

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,360
mastering a musical instrument where you

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,010
like you know learn how to play the

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,770
violin correctly and where all the notes

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,990
are and how to make certain sounds and

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,640
the statistical theory is sort of

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,500
analogous to the musical theory where

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,080
there's like certain patterns work

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,580
really well there's certain ways of like

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,990
creating dissonance and then having all

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,290
come together that create like a

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,330
pleasing sound for the human ear and

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,580
then the full analysis is really this

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,010
piece of music so there's still a ton of

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,990
flexibility for creativity even when

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,180
you're abiding by all the theory or

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,399
maybe breaking some theory and really

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,750
principled ways and you're like you've

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,300
mastered the tooling but there's still

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,490
this huge creative space out there and

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,650
so that's sort of like the spirit of

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,529
defining these two processes is

00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,480
different is that we want the technical

00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:05,320
part to not get in the way of like

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:09,160
composing your symphony all right so

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,690
back to the tweets so there was all

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,029
those replies of like different titles

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,610
and then this guy Carl came in and

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,140
Carl's like dear friend Carl came in and

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,510
he was like how about a good analyst

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:24,040
with a winky face and a bunch of people

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,690
liked it and so I give him this talk a

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,580
few times and I perpetually am like

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,810
Carl's a great guy he's really really

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,970
nice

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,650
if you email him and ask him a question

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,970
he'll send you back like pages of notes

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:38,320
so I'm throwing him under the bus but

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,339
he's actually a good person I'm sure he

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,459
didn't mean to kind of like make people

00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:47,980
feel bad but I do think kind of phrasing

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,350
this is like Oh doing all this stuff is

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,329
just like to be good at your job because

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,730
then the opposite of that is that you're

00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:56,620
like a bad analyst so like if you create

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,000
an analysis that's not reproducible

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,649
you're bad at your job

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,629
and I'm sure a lot of people you know

00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,370
this stuff is not easy right like we're

00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:07,160
all at a conference because we like care

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,660
about it and we work on it and so kind

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,680
of like telling people that they're bad

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,569
at their job because they haven't

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,449
mastered like all of the different

00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:15,829
things you need in order to create these

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:19,339
complex documents that we don't even

00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:20,240
talk about like it's that's doubled with

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,649
that probably if probably a lot of

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,449
people would feel bad at the end of the

00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,089
day I don't think any of us probably

00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:29,060
feel like we write perfect reproducible

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:32,990
collaborative you know accurate analyses

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:36,829
every time we write one so anyway back

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,480
to my idea which was the right one

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:42,139
here sort of this like analysis

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,639
developer and actually a Gabe Becker who

00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:45,920
did not reply to any of this but it

00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,480
talked to me afterwards made a really

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,209
compelling point which is that it's less

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,800
about like the person's title because

00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,649
then some people are that way and some

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,449
people aren't and so I think it's really

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,850
more about like the process and defining

00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:00,170
the process and saying you know like

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,939
when you're doing analysis development

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,879
here are some principles that you should

00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:09,589
be abiding by so I was a little bit

00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:11,420
wrong there okay so like why do I care

00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,160
about this and why am I talking about

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,050
this this is probably one of the less

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,500
technical talks that you're coming to

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,629
today and so the reason why is because I

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,850
feel like right now we're sort of in a

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,000
place where we're like yada yada yada

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,550
like away the best part it's like when

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,430
we like do analysis we're not actually

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,680
talking about what we're doing so much

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,860
and we'll instead talk about like the

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,389
narrative aspects and you know like the

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,459
cool new model we're using but it's

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:42,110
pretty rare I mean it's getting better

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,360
but it's it's more rare that we actually

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,370
talk about like oh I wanted to make this

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,949
reproducible and so I made these choices

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:53,540
and here's you know screenshots of what

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:56,000
I did and I am spec um from the stat

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,339
community and was trained in the SAC

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,139
community and so the types of things

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,480
that I would hear the most like kind of

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,160
the resistance to this where ideas like

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,350
oh I really don't want to limit

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,240
creativity like I don't want to have to

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,940
abide by all these rules because I want

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,610
to be able to do whatever I want

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,230
and then also I think that probably was

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,060
people probably said that as

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,500
rationalization but the actual reason

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,470
was that they were embarrassed by their

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,540
code and their personal process and I

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,160
think probably everyone here would feel

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,480
a little hesitant before just like

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,320
publishing everything they've ever

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,240
written so we all are embarrassed and so

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,710
you know that's a problem too and I'm

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,670
gonna talk about sort of how I think we

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:40,430
can get past that so why does this all

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,750
matter the reason why is because I think

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,780
it's really getting in the way of

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:48,710
sharing best practices and codifying

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,540
them as a community and so as of now I

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,490
mean even at this conference they're

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,460
like we talked about kind of known

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,760
common solutions to problems when you're

00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,890
developing analysis or I guess there so

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,270
we have like known common problems and

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,780
then there's actually already kind of

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:08,300
like solutions to those problems and so

00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,910
when I talk about common problems I made

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,730
a big list but you don't have to read

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:16,340
all these slides are online but there

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,110
are things like yeah you can't rerun you

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,080
know you can't rerun your analysis and

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,550
get the same results so like you know

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,780
probably everyone's run into that once

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,600
earlier in their career and that's a

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,000
very frustrating situation there's also

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,470
things like yeah you you update your

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,220
analysis and then you can't compare it

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:36,680
to previous results or you know you are

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,570
not like your code isn't performing as

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,220
expected but you didn't notice so like

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,680
some function broke at some point and

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,500
you didn't inspect it and so you've been

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,570
getting garbage results for a while and

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,400
so there's just like a whole list I mean

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,900
I think everyone could sit down and

00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,760
write a list similar to this of like

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,570
problems I've run into in the past when

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,490
doing my work and I sort of actually

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,770
grouped these into like problems with

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,480
reproducibility so things like oh you

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,610
use an external library and that was

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,580
updated and so now you can't reproduce

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,670
your results using the old libraries or

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,339
with accuracy things like you know you

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,020
changed the logic of a function but then

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,660
over here you're not using the function

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,220
and so now you have different results

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,930
between the two and then the

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,339
collaborative thing like you know two

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,579
people want to combine their code but

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,439
they

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:28,459
do it you haven't set up sort of the

00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:29,959
pathways for that to happen and so I'll

00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:33,230
go into some of these in more detail

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,420
later but like what I what I want to

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,920
convey is that if we have common

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,540
problems that all of us have probably

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,949
run into at some point and we have

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,389
potential solutions for them because all

00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:46,639
of us have solved it one way or another

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,399
and so how do we kind of codify those as

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,410
a group and so this is where I want to

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,779
kind of take a left turn and start to

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,939
talk about the operations world and

00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,889
specifically like the DevOps world how

00:15:55,939 --> 00:16:01,309
many people are familiar with DevOps as

00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:03,980
a principle okay like everyone here so

00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:06,019
the idea here is that so this was like a

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,819
big part of the job at Etsy was this big

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:09,230
online marketplace there's a ton of

00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:11,540
servers the servers had to stay up

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,160
there's a lot of small transactions so

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,489
the server is going down lost us a lot

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,040
of money I'm certainly is a very DevOps

00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:22,999
heavy culture and the biggest part of

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,489
that was this whole concept of human

00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:28,160
error or essentially like human error

00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:29,600
doesn't exist and and just like

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,189
blameless post-mortems how many people

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,149
are familiar with blameless post-mortems

00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:38,959
some okay cool yeah so the idea here is

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:40,809
that this this book is like represents a

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,209
paradigm shift in how you think about

00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:46,730
errors when they happen and the idea is

00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:48,379
to switch from blaming a person for an

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,449
error so saying like oh that was like

00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,389
user error human error but you hear all

00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:55,549
the time in the news so it's a shift

00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:58,579
from doing that to blaming the process

00:16:55,549 --> 00:17:00,709
they were using and the idea is that you

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,089
it's sort of a you trust your employees

00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:05,149
or you trust the people you're working

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,829
with and so you can make the assumption

00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,260
that when this person was doing their

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,149
job they did not intend to make an error

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,620
like they weren't that was not what they

00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:14,120
set out to do that morning because I'm

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,779
sure their day is worse because they did

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,699
make an error and so if you assume the

00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,319
person had good intentions and was doing

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,179
their job and didn't expect the error to

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,909
happen then you actually bring blame the

00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:28,700
process for failing that person and so

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:31,309
it's like oh that process was not you

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,480
know sufficient for this good intention

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,940
person to get their job done

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,669
and it's sort of like a simple idea but

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,030
to me it was a huge paradigm shift

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:43,590
especially coming from academia it's

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,400
definitely not a blameless culture there

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:49,140
and so um so anyway yeah I have like a I

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,830
have an example so since some of you

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,210
don't know Blaine was post-mortem I

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,250
hopefully will be a funny example of

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,780
sort of putting a blameless post-mortem

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,590
into life and kind of like solving

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,020
process and so this is around my CD

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,080
collections growing up how many people

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:10,740
here had like seriously organized CD

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,880
collections yeah yeah okay it's cuz

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,910
we're gonna date a comprehensive any so

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,140
so I had a lot of processor on my CD

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:24,000
collection so much so that I actually

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,950
wrote a college essay about it and so it

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,510
was the first ya University of Chicago

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,520
they have like crazy questions and so

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,710
describe about it I came up with the

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,150
idea of like describing an idiosyncrasy

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:39,179
and so yeah I start the essay with this

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:42,750
like ridiculous statement of like oh

00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:44,880
right when final exams ended I rushed

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,470
home and like with a broad smile on my

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,160
face I did what I've been wanting to do

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:53,730
all semester I organize my CDs not a

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,980
normal teenager and so but the reason

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,700
this was important to me was because

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:03,480
this is me and my brother traveling and

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,870
like expressing how we feel when we

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,760
traveling very visually so like we

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,010
traveled a lot as kids you know there's

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,510
traveling you get tired right and so the

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,940
incident that occurred was that my

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,570
brother lost his CD binder on an

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,580
airplane so he like left his CDs lost

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,220
the whole collection and like if you

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,350
remember in the like early 2000 CDs were

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,720
as expensive as they are now so it was

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,880
like a lot of money especially for a

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,090
teenager so it was very very upsetting

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,790
and I found this to be like a very

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:38,429
difficult emotional experience and so I

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,600
just like determined to not have this

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:43,230
happen to me because it was so

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,220
traumatizing and so I and CD copying had

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,650
just come out

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,600
and so I decided like okay well in order

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,390
to avoid this incident that just

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,419
occurred I am going to create copies of

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,190
every single one of my CDs and so that's

00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,809
like a reasonable solution how many

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,370
people did that with their CD collection

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:04,080
anyway yes cool okay so you're on board

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,539
so it's like I I've treated myself to

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,270
like a little wavy CD tower and I got

00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,400
all these binders and I got the blank

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,990
CDs and I had a system and actually my

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,730
brother was reminding me he even had a

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,220
more detailed system where he would like

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,559
put a little a and like anyway so it was

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,559
a system that was going to solve this

00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:24,690
problem for me and then naturally like

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,750
the system started to like fall apart

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,610
where it was like I'd planned for kind

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,440
of a set number of CDs and then of

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,409
course I like quickly got too many CDs

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,840
and so I had like oh I described it as

00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,809
like a little seat city of CD Towers in

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,700
the corner of my room and I had like all

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:44,700
of these binders you know it's like

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,679
multiple binders and then I kind of go

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,580
into like a weird fever dream that's

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,500
like during final exams I like I would

00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,630
oh right yeah I would have trouble like

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,669
if I bought an Ace of Base CD I would

00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,960
have to like shuffle every CD over

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,030
because they are all are like

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,250
alphabetical and so I would just be

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,929
sitting on the floor like shuffling CDs

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,520
and then when I was doing that I would

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,070
like miscount and I would shuffle one

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,500
too far and then I just like go back and

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,320
so at one point yeah I go into this like

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,260
fever dreams state where I like run out

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,020
and get index cards because I saw on

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,990
When Harry Met Sally that like cheese

00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,700
index cards to to organize things so I

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,100
carry the index cards that had all of my

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,690
CD titles like in alphabetical order I'm

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,220
not even sure how this actually helps

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,580
but it meant I could count things more

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,620
easily and just to show you the scene

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,299
and When Harry Met Sally it's like it's

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,179
like the big scene when Carrie and Sally

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,370
are more than friends and he's like

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:43,380
laying in bed and he's like you have all

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:46,890
your videotapes alphabetized and on

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,059
index cards and she's just like oh yeah

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,169
do you want to watch something like

00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:54,419
that's a totally normal thing to do so

00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:55,440
yeah that was like Harry's moment of

00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,180
regret

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,070
like this person so anyway okay so that

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,690
was like comical example but I did

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,670
actually follow a lot of like blameless

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,320
post-mortem sort of like I didn't spend

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,850
any time focusing on my brother because

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,270
I understood what it felt like to be

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:14,340
tired on vacation instead I focused on

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,590
like the incident and what happened and

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,390
then I changed the system so that it

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,770
would be basically impossible for me to

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,140
lose those originals because they were

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:25,680
just living in the city tower city in my

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,100
home and I used outside resources by

00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,110
like consulting with one Harry Met Sally

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,730
and deciding to use that like computers

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,220
are around so I don't know why I thought

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,750
index cards were right solution and then

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,100
finally like I kind of made trade-offs

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,320
or in this case I actually didn't make

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,580
any trade-offs but like I was an adult I

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,440
might be like is this really necessary

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,130
like maybe you don't need that index

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,300
cards but this is like ideally when you

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,770
run into a problem this is sort of what

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,770
happens you changed the whole system in

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,570
order to make it better and so a blame

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,100
full process would have looked a lot

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,920
more probably what your childhood

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,020
actually looked like where you know the

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,270
parents are like Alex that's my brothers

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,040
I am like keep better track of your CDs

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,310
next time which definitely did happen

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,170
just to assure you and so Jay like

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,550
translating that into you know the data

00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,990
analysis world that would just be

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,910
something like hey you need to check

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,710
this analysis more carefully so it's

00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,540
like advice that doesn't actually help

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,770
doesn't actually prevent errors it just

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,610
makes you feel kind of guilty and like

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:26,760
you were bad at your job and so that is

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,230
like I mean it's I'm sympathetic to the

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,120
idea that it's like hey people need

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,970
thick skin and like that you know but I

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,160
just think it's I feel like what I saw

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,330
duxi was just the fact that you

00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,740
shouldn't assume that everyone needs

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,000
thick skin like you should just build

00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,750
processes that make people feel

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,820
encouraged to share mistakes and so like

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,460
I said yeah and this is very much kind

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,280
of John all spa influenced the former

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,930
CTO of Etsy and he wrote a bunch of

00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,790
stuff about doing blameless post mortems

00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,740
and like really his full-time job was

00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,840
like getting blameless post mortems like

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,380
talked about and indoctrinated in the

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,010
culture and I thought he had some really

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,810
great quotes so this was my favorite one

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,310
where he was saying you know an engineer

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,860
who thinks that they're going to be

00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,380
reprimanded

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,600
is disincentivized to give details

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,880
necessary to get an understanding of the

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,789
mechanism pathology and operation of the

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,049
failure so like in my brother analogy

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,210
it's like he might have tried to hide

00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:25,210
from my parents that he lost the CDs and

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,990
I'm actually pretty sure he did because

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,760
he knew my dad was Amelia and so it's

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,909
like I think that's like the central

00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,710
idea here is that you know we have this

00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:39,039
list of problems that we've all run into

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,110
with analyses before and you can think

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,090
about it like we kind of have had these

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,490
like blameless post-mortems kind of

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:48,700
personally where we have started to

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:51,070
adopt things like using github or you

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,720
know creating scripts for analyses so

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:56,260
we've kind of done like mini blameless

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,460
post-mortems our selves and so we kind

00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,799
of are already at the point where we

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,830
know how to address many of these

00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,080
problems and I'll go I'll go through

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,360
these in much more detail but you know

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,299
things like having code review or having

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:23,860
executable scripts or having issue

00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:25,570
tracking but so yeah anyway I'll just

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,769
let this person be really embarrassed

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,769
and come in or not

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,370
sorry

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,320
so yeah like like the idea that we

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,110
already have like getting back on track

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,370
the idea that we already have like at

00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,049
this conference we're talking about

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,909
these ideas right and these are ideas

00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:44,590
that probably don't seem foreign I'm not

00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:46,510
trying to act like in this talk I have

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,610
anything new that I've developed to like

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:52,179
do analysis perfectly I just want us to

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,870
talk about this more and so I call these

00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:57,880
the opinions and so this is sort of the

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:01,870
opinion part of opinionated analysis

00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,760
development and I'm going to go through

00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:07,840
them all and sort of the idea here is

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,909
that I think we shouldn't we should be

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,710
more explicit about the idea that we

00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:14,740
think these are best practices and that

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,269
these are the right things to do so the

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,010
first one I think this one's a

00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:20,470
no-brainer especially at this conference

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,639
if we were at kind of like a bi

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,279
conference that might be different

00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,109
though

00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:26,629
the idea of having executable scripts

00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:27,889
for your analyses and this addresses

00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:30,200
some of the problems of like you know

00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:32,659
rerunning analysis being able to get the

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,690
same results getting other people to

00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:37,809
repeat it and like being able to take

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:41,599
analysis and apply it to different data

00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:43,249
so again nope no concerns here define

00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,719
dependencies I think this one is

00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:47,809
starting to get into territory where we

00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:49,129
don't all necessarily do it and so when

00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:50,570
I talk about to find dependencies

00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:53,840
there's kind of like external

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,759
dependencies so like having your

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,450
libraries all like explicitly defined

00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,950
and shared and so because if that is

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,629
part of your dependency graph right

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,460
little code that's being used externally

00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:06,919
so if that gets updated it can mess up

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,989
your results and then there's also just

00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,419
like the code chunks or the like cells

00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:12,940
and just like saying like hey this cell

00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,229
depends on these other ones up here

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,940
that's something that I don't I don't

00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:17,749
how many people feel like they do that

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,989
regularly

00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:24,859
I don't either so it's fine

00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:26,749
but we all should so the next one this

00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:29,029
one is definitely not used a ton but I'm

00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:31,999
having Watchers for change data and code

00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:33,619
so like if you change code but you don't

00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:35,330
reacts acute it you'd get some sort of

00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,799
like error message that's like hey these

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,309
results are out of sync with the code

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,469
and I the only solution the only tool

00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:46,039
that I think does that well it's like

00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:48,979
make right now like gene you make and I

00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,809
don't think most people use that modular

00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:53,389
tested code this is getting back into

00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,269
the territory of what we mostly do so

00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:57,830
like writing functions and so yeah like

00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:59,629
that solves the problem of being able to

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:04,460
reuse logic in different parts of your

00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:06,259
analyses and then like being able to

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,789
like test those functions so that

00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,469
they're performing as expected so having

00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:13,119
unit test in the functions to make sure

00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:13,119
it's all working the way you want

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,899
version control I think is like a pretty

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,450
widely used practice or at least you

00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:22,339
probably all feel like you should do it

00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,080
and so the idea here this will address

00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:26,779
concerns and like problems or errors

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,799
like you update your analysis and you

00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,289
want to compare it to the previous

00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:32,179
results you want to point to code

00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:33,710
changes that like resulted in your

00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,389
different analysis do you want to tell a

00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,760
collaborator like here's what I changed

00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:38,120
and here

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,110
what it caused and then it also

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,580
addresses some of the collaboration

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,620
issues so like you know being able to

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,480
combine code is easiest when you're

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,380
using github or another version control

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,780
system this one I love and I don't think

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,730
many people do it yet I don't think the

00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,950
tooling is there to do it yet and it's

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,080
assertive testing of data assumptions

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,900
and results so like unit testing for

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,080
your data and this one I think is really

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,940
interesting because if you have if

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,140
you're if you have a reproducible script

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,810
and you're like re running it every

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,430
night for a dashboard if the data drifts

00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,320
from some of the assumptions you made

00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,450
and checked originally and you don't

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,420
have proactive tests on it then you can

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,530
start to get pretty like focused results

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,580
so it's sort of it's like the one thing

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,530
that actually gets worse with

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,040
reproducibility which is sort of

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,100
interesting

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,080
so yeah the idea with that is that the

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,620
problems or the errors that will solve

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,900
is like when your data becomes corrupted

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,940
you'll notice and then if you have a new

00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,180
data set that renders your methods

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,950
invalid you'll notice that two code

00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,580
review actually I'm super curious how

00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:49,730
many people do code review for analyses

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:52,230
nice well like all the time or like how

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,030
well yeah I'm curious I would love to

00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,860
hear afterwards of like how to

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,860
incentivize that within a team because

00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,530
it's hard to do right it's a hard

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,970
cultural shift to make and so code

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,590
review obviously helps you especially

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,140
with accuracy where it's like you make

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,880
it a mistake and you didn't notice or

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,160
you're using like super inefficient code

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,290
and someone can say like hey don't use

00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,050
for loops and are and you know you

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:18,150
figure it out and this one I feel like

00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,070
is I put this as a fundamental opinion

00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,960
even though I think most people wouldn't

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,850
think this is a fundamental opinion

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,780
which is just like issue tracking and

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,310
communication around progress and status

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,840
and I think it just it solves so many

00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,040
problems with collaboration where you're

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,660
talking about like how do you

00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,030
communicate collaboration can your

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,440
collaborators see where you're at

00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:39,330
can they make requests in like a way

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,930
that doesn't totally disrupt and upset

00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,700
you and yeah just like it it makes

00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,650
projects move smoothly that's why it's

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,800
like a fundamental part

00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:50,060
github okay so I put this at the end of

00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,290
that section cuz I feel like it's a

00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,450
little bit of a slog getting through

00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,830
them but I did want to spend time kind

00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:58,760
of like outlining exactly what I was

00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,860
thinking so you might be wondering at

00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,470
this point like why I'm spending this

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,680
talk talking about process so much and

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,840
why I think that's so important and the

00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,420
reason why is because without good

00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:15,020
process opinions can really become toxic

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,160
very quickly and it can create a toxic

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,450
culture where you feel like people are

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,640
kind of shoving their opinions down your

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,230
throat and the reason why I know this is

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,190
because I have a lot of experience being

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:27,800
opinionated and so I have a quote in

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,240
here from a friend that was like oh I

00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,930
never fight with anyone else except for

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,310
you at his birthday party so I've

00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,050
thought a lot about kind of like the

00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,760
downside of being opinionated and

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,180
feeling like you're right and wanting to

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,590
help people do the right thing and I

00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,940
think it comes from a good place at

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,060
least I want to tell myself it comes

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,800
from a good place because like this is

00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,200
actually from John Knauss balls earlier

00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,580
blog post talking about you know a funny

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,800
thing happens when engineers make

00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,630
mistakes and feel safe giving details

00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,920
they not only want to be held

00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,560
accountable they're also enthusiastic

00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,200
and helping like the rest of the company

00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,000
avoid the same error in the future and

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,500
they're you know they're the most expert

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,700
in their error and they ought to be

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,760
heavily involved in coming up with

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,230
remediation items so I do think when

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,380
you're opinionated and you're like

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,970
telling people what to do it most the

00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,470
time is coming from a good place so like

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,780
hey this was really helpful for me and I

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:23,600
want to help you but their delivery

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,970
that's very important and we live in an

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,550
era where delivery mechanisms can be

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,550
really toxic so I have here you kind of

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:34,280
like combine the like well actually

00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:37,970
attitude like well actually you should

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,130
be using github with Twitter which I

00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,610
described as a platform designed for

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:46,640
miscommunication and then you're kind of

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,890
like really into a coding choice so like

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,930
I am like an art person and so it's like

00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,370
you like busted and you're like you

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,360
should be using well actually you should

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:58,650
be using are

00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,720
that is like recipe for a complete

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:03,150
standstill how many people have

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,550
experienced this yeah excellent

00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,080
okay so enthusiasm I'll be the first to

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:11,100
admit that this was me for much of my

00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,840
20s and so like you know just some like

00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,380
simple examples you should be using

00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,640
github like I'm sure I'm sure like most

00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,610
people in here have uttered that phrase

00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,040
once or twice and so like yeah in my

00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:25,170
like reframing you know a healthful

00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,250
coworker would say something like oh if

00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,800
this is a project where you want to

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,080
compare results to focus on the problem

00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,450
at solving you might want to use a

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,420
version control so then focus on the

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:39,210
opinion not the software choice and then

00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,520
like github good our studio integrates

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,290
with github like you can put Jupiter

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,390
notebooks on github etc like there's

00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:47,670
there's ways to sort of tease apart the

00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,680
points and so then that really starts a

00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,230
conversation where the person say oh I

00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,090
do care about version control I can't

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,780
use github for these reasons but maybe

00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:59,610
I'll use git lab something like that

00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,460
this one I just put in for the the cheap

00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:04,800
the cheap joke saying something like

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,420
Excel is the worst again I feel like

00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,510
probably everyone in here has said that

00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,740
before and so again to make this a

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,330
productive conversation with your

00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,760
business partners you might want to say

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:17,100
something more like oh you know Excel

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,080
makes it hard to create scripts and if

00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,170
you want to redo this analysis and not

00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:25,110
have to you know re merge cells and

00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:26,580
smooth things over and whatever you know

00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,870
writing a script will take more time now

00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,570
but then it'll save you a lot of time

00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:32,490
later and so it's just like shifting

00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,510
from this I know better than you - lots

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,330
of people run into this problem

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,950
including me and here is the solution

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,790
and software that makes that solution

00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:43,050
easy and so I thought a lot about this

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,270
and like should we really call this

00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,190
opinionated like that's kind of a loaded

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,080
term I don't think most people have

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,380
positive associations when they hear

00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,270
that word but the reason why is because

00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,550
opinionated software is a thing so this

00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,140
idea of software that believes that a

00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,210
certain way of doing things is right and

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,310
you should provide software like no

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,050
certain processes right and you should

00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,060
be providing software that encourages

00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,070
that process

00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,690
and the Creator is kind of like the

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:13,290
first from what I understand one of the

00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,790
first opinionated software things

00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,860
software

00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,500
one of the first opinionated software's

00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:22,410
was Ruby on Rails and so that creator

00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,940
had this great quote talking about it's

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,350
a strong disagreement with conventional

00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,840
wisdom that everything should be

00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:30,030
configurable that the framework should

00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,990
be impartial and objective in my mind

00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,690
that's the same as saying that

00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,870
everything should be equally hard and I

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,370
super agree with that and I'll sort of

00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,580
say my like edgy

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,830
I actually I think that both our studio

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,440
and Jupiter could like up their

00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,140
opinionated a game a little and like

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,280
implement processes a little bit more

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,650
they're like in the absence of that

00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,140
there are a lot of good like plugins or

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,670
pack our packages that introduce some

00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,670
more structure and kind of push you in

00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:02,580
the right direction so I sort of this

00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,950
whole this whole like talk is based on

00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,350
me finding the project template our

00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,810
package years ago and just how much that

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,730
changed the way I work there's also I

00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,900
think cookie cutter for Python for my

00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,480
colleagues I hear that that's like a

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,690
pretty good one also that implements

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,580
similar process in in Python and then I

00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,380
know that beaker X would there's a

00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,730
presentation on that earlier it sounded

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,920
like also sort of an opinionated

00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:29,400
framework for ipython or for Jupiter

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,860
notebooks and then at Citrix we have

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,510
notebook which is also similar sort of

00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,320
implementing some of these opinions on

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:40,470
like a plugin for Jupiter notebooks and

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,360
so yeah like the reason I care so much

00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:44,700
about having an opinionated analysis

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,430
software is because if you've ever had

00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,500
to use uh opinionated software or like

00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,650
even worse software with like the wrong

00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,000
opinions it can be really frustrating

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,710
and I definitely had that experience and

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,330
a former job where a very

00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,740
well-intentioned engineer sort of

00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,040
created this thing that was sort of

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,180
stapled on top of something else and I

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,610
just remember sitting in the meeting and

00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,740
being like having this like this is

00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,480
bullying like there are rules to this

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,950
like you can't just create any software

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,580
and think that it's good because it

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,840
doesn't fail and so yeah it's like we

00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,090
can start being like well this is

00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,850
analysis there are rules or this is

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,890
analysis too

00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:24,550
there are rules here like really on

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:26,950
board with me so yeah so just to like

00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,630
recap what I was talking about I think

00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,760
we really need to define this process

00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,280
and I am I'm saying that should be

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,990
analysis development you can call it

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,820
analysis engineering if your progression

00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:40,360
or probe Regina

00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,890
um I think it's along with that it's

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,720
really crucial to create encourage a

00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,850
blameless culture so make sure that the

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,430
it's never about blaming someone for

00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:50,860
doing something wrong frame the

00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:54,250
discussions around incidents rather than

00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,290
around software choices and discuss the

00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:59,500
opinion so discuss these like principles

00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,700
rather than the software itself and then

00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,400
encourage software makers to create

00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:07,560
opinionated analysis software which I'm

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:10,360
trying to do now so so yeah thanks

00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,580
thanks especially to skipper Seybold

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,350
who's here Jenny Brian Carl broman John

00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:18,580
McDonnell gave me a ton of feedback on

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:28,860
this and yeah thanks any questions I am

00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:28,860
up here do we have time for questions

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:34,840
okay is that just down the hall in

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,240
Gramercy I don't know how to say it

00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,310
they're doing user testing for the

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,980
Jupiter lab project so it's actually

00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,990
really cool to have several of the core

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,540
devs there and they're just sitting you

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,340
down and running you through how it is

00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,950
you typically interact with Jupiter labs

00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,780
so they have a sign-up sheets for it so

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,030
I you don't have to do it now but I

00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,680
would suggest that you go sign up if

00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:00,100
you're at all interested in Jupiter lab

00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,900
and and helping out with getting feature

00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,270
requests or saying hey this makes sense

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,430
this doesn't make sense so they're open

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:09,850
until I think it's eight o'clock tonight

00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:11,590
and they're open from tomorrow from I

00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,090
don't know business hours 9:00 to 5:00

00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:16,180
something like that so you can go over

00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,810
there sign up and then come back either

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,130
to this session or another session to

00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:25,110
see the talk so you have 10 minutes to

00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,110
do that cool awesome

00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:46,380
yeah I think we should do questions but

00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:46,380
people should feel free to yeah yeah

00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:55,990
yeah it's a good question I've

00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,470
definitely been trying to evangelize so

00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:02,859
like educators I have friends and stat

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,359
education still and I mean I do think

00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:07,080
company culture is probably

00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:11,590
realistically where this will be learned

00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,359
and I was really inspired by learning

00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,680
more about the history of DevOps and the

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,050
fact that it went through a similar

00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,950
shift sort of only in industry right

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,730
because you don't really have like

00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:23,740
DevOps in' in academia and it was I

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,900
think the fundamentally this is being

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,550
pushed by the tooling so the fact that

00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,020
people are starting to write scripts and

00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,180
then all the complexities that come from

00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,010
there the devops world went through that

00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,260
really similar shift where it went from

00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,310
you know you have an operator and you

00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,240
have people who develop software and

00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,820
they're totally different

00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,280
- oh the operator is going to be writing

00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,420
the solutions themselves and needs to be

00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,160
thinking about solutions while they're

00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,510
writing it so I think like we're

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,790
actually it's like this has happened

00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:52,090
before it will happen again like this is

00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:54,550
the same who you watch Battlestar yeah

00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:57,100
so it's like it's the same thing

00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,359
happening and so I think it'll it's a

00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,390
good question I would love it if it was

00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:03,430
taught I think realistically companies

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,850
that want like these full-stack data

00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:13,170
scientists who implement solutions that

00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:13,170
will be the driving force so cool yes

00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:29,989
yeah for sure

00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:41,590
that's a really good questions it's yeah

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,020
it's kind of like chicken or egg because

00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,790
once people do it then people will start

00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:49,990
writing solutions for it to make it more

00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:52,030
efficient and so I'd like absent of

00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,890
being able to just go with like feature

00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:56,140
request to open-source developers which

00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,570
is like maybe not the best way to

00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,780
interact with open-source developers I

00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:06,130
think that probably hacking things

00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:08,710
together and doing it scrappy is is it

00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:11,440
is like a forcing function for that but

00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,630
that being said I don't I wouldn't as a

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,400
manager I wouldn't want to like force

00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,910
everyone to do some super heavyweight

00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,170
thing either and I actually think I mean

00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,590
now that I'm talking this you actually

00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:25,870
feel like it's most important to just to

00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,640
like let people know that this there is

00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:29,110
like a right theoretical solution to

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,880
this even if there's the tooling it's

00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,200
not there to do it so like kind of what

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,240
I was talking about with make where it's

00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,530
like there's just not really a solution

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,600
that works and kind of an analyst first

00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:45,100
workflow and you would have to be kind

00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,270
of like engineering to do it and so so I

00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,410
feel like that's like the most important

00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,700
thing to me is not like forcing people

00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,440
to do it but just making sure that

00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:59,340
people know like there is a solution

00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:59,340
like that seems like a good idea yeah

00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,730
yeah

00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,829
mm-hmm

00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:43,369
yeah yeah yeah I mean I'm super open to

00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,859
the idea that there might already be

00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:47,359
because it's like again these problems

00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:48,530
have been solved in like the devops

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,540
world and probably the software

00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,730
engineering world and I'm coming at it

00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:55,040
as a academic statistician turned data

00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:58,550
scientist so I am not aware of like

00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:03,020
everything out there I just I do caution

00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:04,490
that very frequently people assume that

00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,020
data scientists can do like lots of

00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,540
engineering stuff that may or may not

00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,980
actually be true and so I would be

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,150
interested in like knowing more cuz I

00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,130
don't know anything about it like how

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:20,230
easy it would be to implement I'm like

00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:29,829
every day to problem any other questions

00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:29,829
yeah yeah yeah

00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:39,619
yeah yeah right

00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,080
yeah no I mean I don't think I can

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,000
answer that and I think the fact that

00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,400
you can frame it is like a trade-off is

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,350
my goal of this is that instead of

00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,700
people like yelling about like you

00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,170
should be using this software because it

00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,750
has tests and tests are so important

00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,730
it's like oh like let's weigh the pros

00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,860
and cons for this concept for this

00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:05,110
application and know the trade-offs were

00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,960
making and potentially make tooling

00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:09,520
choices based on that and like I just I

00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,010
think that that can be a really

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,990
productive conversation but so

00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:16,270
frequently it's just about the language

00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,370
and it's actually like this weird

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:27,240
argument about something over here but

00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:27,240
it's coming out over there exactly yeah

00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,380
