Title: Citing the Jupyter Notebook in the scientific publication process - Bernie Randles, Hope Chen
Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Although researchers have traditionally cited code and data related to their publications, they are increasingly using the Jupyter Notebook to share the processes involved in the act of scientific inquiry. Bernie Randles and Hope Chen explore various aspects of citing Jupyter notebooks in publications, discussing benefits, pitfalls, and best practices for creating the "paper of the future."

	00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:08,930
so I'm going to start by talking about

00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:14,510
open science open science ISM is just a

00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:16,850
framework for how people can share and

00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,850
it's just a set of best practices which

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:23,180
might be required by funding agencies a

00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:27,650
cultural thing it depends on the field

00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:30,020
how open Sciences and in Open Science

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,640
framework research objects are what are

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,910
called fair this is just a set of

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,250
guidelines principles made by force 11

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,489
if any of you are familiar that they're

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,960
the group that works on these clinics

00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:46,090
credit to do searchers for the work that

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:49,120
they do and leaving : data and

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:52,489
technological inventions that they use

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,100
and so the fair principles are findable

00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,980
accessible interoperable and beautiful

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,469
and these originally started with these

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,149
principles with data but I'm going to

00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,219
apply these to that you can our

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,530
notebooks because I think this is the

00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:10,880
new cleaner notebooks are the are an

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:14,479
interface between cone and data and so

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,600
why would we do open science there's

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,579
transparency there's reproducibility

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,399
these innovation and all of these

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,810
reasons why we you know in the olden

00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:26,389
times frame our client would want to

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,099
make your science available to the

00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:34,549
public and so we're going to talk about

00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:37,189
our case study is astronomy I work with

00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:40,399
astronomers for my work and usability

00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:43,639
and so the Astronomy has a as a rich

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,829
history of sharing and being open to the

00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:47,779
public for example the Sloan Digital Sky

00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:50,229
Survey where they're trying to take it

00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:52,520
back of the entire night sky

00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:54,859
they've been doing this for 20 years all

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,069
this data is open and available to cover

00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:59,000
and the astrophysics data system is

00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,890
another

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,980
repository of communications which is

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,840
available and is connected to the

00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,950
archive connect for knowledge is also

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,550
improvement open repository of

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:17,630
publications open code examples there

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,730
Astro high and some libraries that are

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:24,140
that are examples of open source

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,900
projects that people are working on and

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,350
so for two analysis and tools for open

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,860
plans

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,020
I claim that they can be fair if they

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,330
are in an open repositories which is

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,970
github and available to the public and

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,300
shareable and this is a screenshot of

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,709
hope and tolerance I give up people love

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,880
their work that they're keeping me

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:49,770
talking about and so my group but at

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,150
UCLA a little paper elements we looked

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,459
at the juvenile books that were

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,500
mentioned specifically in astrophysics

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,250
data system so these are physicists as

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:03,150
problems people and Jason - astronomy

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,730
that are in this repository and it turns

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,790
out we call 91 publications we did this

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,890
last year and there are eight ways of

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,269
mentioning the notebooks within the

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,360
publication's themselves so we're

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,950
looking at just some publications and

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,230
this was just it's just growing I mean

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,150
if we go on today there's like almost

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,950
200 and I think the last time I checked

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,110
so people are citing these in the

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,810
astrophysics data system it's happening

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,920
and there's no standards for this people

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,930
are just doing it because they're trying

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,190
to give credit or make their work

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,620
available and so the ways that the

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,019
Jupiter notebooks are cited they're

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,930
mentioned a mention is what is called in

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,980
the body of the paper itself we used

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,620
Beck's library or our code is available

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,140
on github and here it is and then

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,320
there's citing the notebooks themselves

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,480
in a in a formal bibliographic citation

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,810
which with a you know with a number and

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,760
then the references in the back and so

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,120
why would we cite mention Jupiter

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,950
notebooks it's making findable credit

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,240
for researchers which is becoming more

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,580
and more important especially in the

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,780
open-source community where people are

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,010
putting in all this work

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,130
they deserve the credit and to be

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,230
tracked I guess you can still hear me

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,260
right I don't know if you need that

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,180
microphone if it doesn't work and then

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,740
this has to do with bibliometrics

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,100
altmetrics which some of you might be

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,139
familiar with which is which which

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,180
notebooks are being used by whom when

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,389
how none of this is it's very difficult

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,210
to to find this now and so this is

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:45,330
something that github is working on but

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,490
it you know it's not perfect at any

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,650
degree for how this works and then the

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,150
measurable impacts of course we would

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,220
love to know how many people are using

00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,710
Jupiter notebooks and for what and and

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,270
this relates to everything you know at

00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,700
the conference here clearly they're

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,910
becoming more popular and everyone seems

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,440
to be using them at this point so and

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,030
then that improves the standards and the

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,250
collaborations and the sustainability

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,030
which is which is what the keynotes were

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,550
a lot of them are about today yesterday

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,180
so ways that you could cite your

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,590
notebooks in an Open Science framework

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,450
would be first of all you would decide

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,180
what data and code can be shared some of

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,070
your code and data might be private so

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,220
you can't so you might want to decide

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,110
what you can cite and then decide on or

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,560
an open repository that to put your

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,600
notebooks code and data in our example

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,590
hope and their group use of state averse

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,780
and a Harvard

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:45,950
other examples are fixed share github

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:48,990
zoo Noto and so within the the dataverse

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,180
framework you put your data your

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,710
documentation your code within there and

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,520
then the descriptive metadata which

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,470
comes along with it and each repository

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,640
varies on how they do these things but

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:05,760
they're similar enough and so then you

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,830
would obtain the do eyes for your in

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,440
this case for these guys they get two

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,310
eyes for their tables their data their

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,650
code isn't github you can't get a DUI in

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,350
github but you can connect to github

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,350
with sonoda and you can take link a DUI

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,240
from sonoda

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,680
- hub for coat if you wanted to and then

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,420
in your paper you would mention all of

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,280
these things it's and all the citations

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,690
so the Jupiter notebooks the wives links

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,510
code The Associated data with it and so

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,700
in astronomy in our case study so this

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,650
is their paper which is a draft it's not

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:47,500
release yeah they haven't published it

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:49,030
yet but they're going to and so the the

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,010
best practice is for mentioning and

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,630
citing so that I took this from the

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,620
double I asked the American astronomy

00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:59,050
Association which is they there this is

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,610
their recommendations on citing code but

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,230
I am applying this to the Jupiter

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,750
notebooks because I think that it makes

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,130
sense from a citation point of view the

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,890
first thing you should do is you should

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,720
cite the paper the the mother of all the

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,660
papers which is you know our Dear

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,920
Leader's Fernando and Brian's original

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,620
ipython paper which if you go to Jupiter

00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,820
dot or they also ask that this is the

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,680
paper that you cite so so that's on the

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,200
granular level that's the top level of

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,180
citation and then you would link to your

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Jupiter notebooks or repository of the

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,530
notebooks and then cite that as well so

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,090
this double layer of how you cite things

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,630
and then also the Associated code

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:43,330
libraries everything is the is that

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:46,690
double-a s recommendation and I think

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:49,570
that what they're saying is just cite as

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,360
many ways and as many people as you can

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,250
to just provide some sort of a

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,350
searchable machine human readable

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,110
element that will eventually be able to

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:02,200
be tracked and then people will be able

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,910
to find your notebooks as well and then

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,250
the mentions in the bodies of the papers

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,730
these might be in the acknowledgments or

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,740
thank you pieces and just what we use

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,750
what libraries we use what code we used

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,430
and then also in the Jupiter notebook

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,790
itself these things could be in there as

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,380
well which libraries which versions

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,270
which dependencies are in there because

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,980
these are always that uh one of the

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,880
biggest problems with any of this is

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:30,400
what libraries did you use to you know

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,570
to compute your your work and their

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,479
research

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,130
and then the links to the notebooks in

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,400
the repository so this is a screenshot

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,880
of Katherine's dataverse instance so

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,280
notice that each of these tables has a

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,410
DOI associated with it you can see that

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,570
right it's kind of small and it you okay

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,580
the first one is a draft version so you

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,740
can obtain a DOI in the universe for a

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,570
draft without releasing it put that in

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,940
your paper publish your paper and then

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,830
open the repository and most of them

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:08,320
work that way I think figshare does as

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:11,170
well so I am going to turn this over to

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,260
hope and he's going to give a very cool

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:20,470
demo of glue along with what is it Ennis

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:23,260
paper Hey

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,100
Oh ken has drawn the aggress student at

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:31,120
Hubbard and at the second part I'm gonna

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,220
talk about science that's the thing that

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,030
we all think is what we're doing

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,200
except sometimes we're not so sure and

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,510
there are two very important

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,320
characteristics that form the foundation

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:47,650
of science which are reproducibility and

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,650
falsifiability which unfortunately in a

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:55,330
tease in astronomy as much as I know are

00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:59,370
not being taken as seriously as as they

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:02,560
probably should and so first which was

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,140
reproducibility many speakers have

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,630
talked about it it demand open data and

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:13,240
open methods and in our case the coast

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,160
so that people can go ahead you know

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,550
take a look at the data and basically

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,950
around the same analysis through through

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:25,150
our coats and hopefully they will get

00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:28,990
the same results as soon as we do for a

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:33,340
certain paper and but first but people

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:36,280
have to also be able to falsify it which

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:40,000
means that these coats not only have to

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,460
be able to be applied on one data set

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,730
which is ours but on many many other

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,160
data sets that people take

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:50,220
at a different time and they need to be

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,529
easily accessible as well so that people

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,860
can actually understand the code modify

00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,940
the analysis themselves and apply on

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,639
their own dataset

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,980
alright so I'm gonna talk about the

00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:08,010
scientific case in the paper that Bernie

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,230
already mentioned so this is the data or

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,779
the data in astronomy looks like it's an

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,889
image of our own galaxy except it

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,620
actually isn't data so its artistic

00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:23,550
rendering of our own galaxy and an unit

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,820
you can see that our own galaxy as as as

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,240
far as astronomers know I said Spiro one

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:34,980
it has these long spiral arms and the

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,740
densest parts are these dark spots along

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:43,290
the spiral arms where the stars are born

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:47,630
and die but because we are sitting here

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:50,940
on earth which is in this disky galaxy

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:53,220
what we actually see on the sky is what

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,480
we call Milky Way a huge bands across

00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:00,449
the entire sky whole year round and with

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:04,709
telescopes both on the ground on earth

00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:08,430
and in the space we are able to produce

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:12,029
to map different patches of the sky and

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:15,720
combine them together to form enormous

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,329
ly large datasets so in our study we

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,750
actually combine more than a dozen

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:23,899
surveys of new keyway of different

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:28,110
different parts of Milky Way different

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:31,800
wavelengths observations and with with

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:35,339
their high-resolution images were able

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,329
to Hound for long skinny structures that

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,360
are really dense

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:42,149
that's why they are so dark as they

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,980
appear on this infrared image they are

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,069
really long a few hundred light years

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,880
long and they are they coat as well so

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:53,519
the this is the kind of object that we

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,610
think sits at right at the center of the

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,150
spiral arms that's why these kind of

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,460
this kind of objects

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:06,820
so important and by studying it we hope

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:09,970
to gain information on the dynamics of

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:14,070
our galaxy and how you rotate and how

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:16,780
stars form alright so one particular

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:21,070
property of this kind of object on the

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:26,020
sky is the density profile across this

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:29,050
long skinny structure and so we so we

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,780
wrote a code a set of code put it on

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,030
github and what it does is that for

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:37,150
example here I have my long skinny

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,130
structure this is a density map it masks

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,520
out everything that's out actually

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:45,970
outside the filaments it takes the

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,730
cross-sections and it matches the the

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,760
peak and extracts the density profile

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:55,270
and then eventually we can use

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,760
mathematical and physical models to to

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,500
obtain information from from the

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,890
cross-section from the density profile

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,960
and interns we know more about the

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,390
dynamics of these kind of given skinny

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,670
structures and eventually we hope to

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,520
know more about our own galaxy and how

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,910
stars are formed inside of this this

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,400
kind of very dense environment

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:23,290
alright so so that's our data and our

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:26,950
codes and most of the as most of the

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:29,170
astronomers what they do today is only

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:34,450
to come by the input end on github who

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:38,050
them on data verse but there's still a

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:42,040
lack of how people can rerun the

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:45,970
analysis and as we all know that there

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:49,660
is one tool that allows us to be able to

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:53,620
do that quite easily which is to burn

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,560
notebook so besides the well I should

00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:00,340
say along with the journal article they

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,180
were modifying and try to get it

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,840
published

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,650
we will also publish we have already put

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:12,520
a notebook on github where other

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,890
astronomers can test whether the

00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,040
results are correct whether they can

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:21,400
reproduce the same results on their own

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,920
laptop maybe there's a glitch am i that

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,190
produces something weird that I don't

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,510
know but they can basically reproduce

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:33,880
the analysis we run the analysis on the

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,220
same set of data and they came talking

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:42,790
their own data as well so I think that's

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:46,780
a good point to start so back to science

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:51,010
now we've already seen that we can carry

00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:54,070
out reproduce the analysis with children

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:58,360
notebook and data and the methods that's

00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:01,620
hosted the notebook and with notebook

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,420
people can also apply the same analysis

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,960
they've found their own data sets but

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,330
imagine that what if we can gain get

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,230
some interactivity we can play with our

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:18,340
own data they can link another map of

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:21,810
the sky and then interact actually

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:26,830
interact between different data sets and

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:29,470
that's where GU comes in and so some of

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,870
you might have heard of it I'll give a

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:36,160
brief introduction of it

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:39,930
it's a GUI Rhian by initiated by Chris

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,150
Bowman who said metrics now and it's now

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,640
actively being developed by Pam

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:48,490
Robicheaux so it links different data

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,280
sets that's why it's called khru so here

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,760
we have the astronomical image and a

00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,330
catalog of a thousand a few thousands of

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,000
saw starts and then you can make

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:05,140
different part of it you can explore the

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,520
data set by arbitrarily selecting on the

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:13,180
plus you make and and not only that crew

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,730
is not only for astronomy it takes other

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:19,500
data formats as well you are looking at

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,449
a geophysical data and it does 3d

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:26,400
visualization and you can actually you

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:29,520
can similarly you can explore the data

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:34,200
selecting in any of the visualizations

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,840
that you make in psych group and the

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,480
team is actually also working with with

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,630
people at Mass General Hospital and try

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,180
to make a group compatible with medical

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,450
data format and hopefully someday you

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:53,100
can save some lives as well

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,640
all right so so that's crew and just one

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,510
hour ago

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,460
I I got an email saying that it's a new

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:04,470
version the more stable versions being

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:08,610
released so that's good news all right

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:12,960
so by combining the notebook and and

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:15,300
group we we hope that someday we can

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,920
write a paper of the future that many

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,750
other speakers at this conference have

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,410
already mentioned using different tools

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:26,670
but with with notebook and Groo I'm

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:36,750
gonna do a live demo of what this paper

00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:39,620
of the future can be so this is your

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,940
notebook you can of course write

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,550
equations more complicated things there

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,880
but what I'm gonna demonstrate is that

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:53,550
after setting up an environment called

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:56,670
MV GU short for local food you can get

00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,300
this group data container which is empty

00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,960
right now

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:06,840
I can love I can load my catalog and the

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:09,420
image into it so you see the the two

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,560
data sets are there right now and then I

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,540
can link the data by so so for example

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,720
like here on the image and in the

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,990
catalog I have the two of what we call

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,140
galactic coordinates so the longitude

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:29,220
and latitude and I can link them inside

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:33,900
a notebook and it talks to chiku there

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:36,780
and in the GUI we can actually take a

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,240
look at what's being linked together or

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,870
grew together and I cannot grew one of

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,730
them if

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:48,240
want and and the the GUI actually talks

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:51,090
back to to the notebook so you can

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,000
review all the links that's there you

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,920
can actually make extra links between

00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,230
different properties

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:04,370
in the GUI as well do that for now and

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:07,250
then I can set up plotting two

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:10,260
properties which is the longitude and

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,650
what we call the local city Rio a

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:17,820
reference velocity which is velocity

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:21,840
basically and then Potvin and then the

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,540
GUI gives me two windows they look like

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,350
normal windows with normal plots right

00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:32,730
now but in a minute okay before I do

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:44,610
anything fancy I'm gonna change the

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:49,830
style of the mockers and it shows up on

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:52,950
the get a prop and then because the two

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:57,200
data sets are actually linked I can plot

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,700
the data points on top of the image

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,890
which is a little bit hard to see right

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,890
now but I can also adjust the contrast

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:11,070
dirty easily like that so some of you

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,140
might have already noticed that's

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,380
there's at this long skinny structure

00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,809
that I talked about and then what if I

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:24,240
want to select those data points found

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:27,510
that happens to be on the disavowal

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,870
skinny structure I can't do selection it

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:33,450
shows up as a stop set and it also shows

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:38,160
up on the scatter plots as well because

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:41,429
the two data sets are now linked cool so

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:45,480
so any any thoughts that you make with

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:48,540
with goo you can grab it from from

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:53,240
notebook inside notebook as I said the

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:57,740
noble talked with with talks with crew

00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:00,799
and good talks back so it sends the a

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,950
metal lip instance back and you can

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:09,740
adjust the labels the annotations

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:13,730
whatever for even for publication the

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,799
scatter part as well and so so believe

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,000
it or not actually in astronomy we found

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:22,429
this out so human eyes are still better

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,149
at identifying struck out structures

00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:28,460
like especially astronomy in astronomy

00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:33,710
you have this kind of random arbitrary

00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:36,799
structures than the machines it's for

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:39,590
now so it is actually quite important

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:44,000
that the masks the subsets that's being

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:48,440
made inside GRU can be can be exported

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,549
back to to the notebook and then I can

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:56,330
grab the mask as it is here and I can

00:22:52,549 --> 00:23:00,200
again make whatever part I want to make

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:03,140
with simply with metal if I can do fancy

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:07,669
things so the data points are now stars

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:12,380
in there and hopefully someday this can

00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:16,220
be expanded I'm together with with the

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,350
widgets and other tools the the notebook

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,730
can be made into a better environment

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:25,760
for for publishing not just the data and

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:32,690
not just the code but a complete article

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:35,390
together with the analysis okay and the

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:39,230
code that makes it possible for notebook

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:42,860
to talk to goo and back is is made

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:46,279
available it's under heavy testing right

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:50,450
now so it's called env goo on github go

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:54,620
get up and then so with the end of the

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:58,750
demo I think Bernie and I can start

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,750
taking questions thanks

00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,509
[Applause]

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:17,710
what do you mean right so I don't know

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,900
if you are at I can't remember one of

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,240
the talks this morning so people always

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,120
think that interactivity and

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,360
reproducibility come fix with each other

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,720
right but I want to stress it again

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,510
Jupiter is this platform that allows you

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,620
so I put my code exactly the same code

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,450
the same setup in inside notebook I've

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:44,890
linked it with the open data that I put

00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:46,780
in data verse I am only allowing the

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,090
users to have in this kind of

00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,190
interactivity to make sure that I'm not

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,950
doing anything sketchy and there's

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,020
nothing special about those setups but

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,990
they can still use the same setups to

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,870
reproduce my results and but they can of

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,910
course changes I mean what if I know

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,700
select some special star which happens

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,440
to be some way rather than the other but

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,570
there's actually nothing special those

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,570
are so that's I think

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:24,190
oh yeah sure so so as I said the what

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:27,850
what it works as at least as I

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:32,350
understand of it right now is that you

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:35,440
can save those masks as some data format

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:38,919
as a image format as a some boolean

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,580
array and then you can sport it and then

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:45,250
crew can can take those in again and I

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,730
can reproduce it I just did very

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:52,049
strictly follow it just now so so yeah

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,049
thanks thanks for that

00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:13,990
no we all we were trying to do was to

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,030
see if they were fair so where they find

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,680
a bowl discoverable when you clicked on

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,590
the link that you're gonna pay well did

00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,020
the link even work so we did not even

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,310
examine whether they ran which by the

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,450
way that's a pitch for for your talk

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,220
these guys trying to achieve if the

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,990
notebooks would even run with

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,060
interesting results that you can find

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:37,690
out later what time is your talk was

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:40,320
four or ten but no we yeah we just

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:45,220
wanted to see if people were making

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,650
these things available because previous

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,230
studies before the notebooks what people

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,090
researchers used to do was just link to

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,060
stuff on their server at the University

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,710
you know till the last name and one of

00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,160
those studies they studied thousands of

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:03,640
papers in from the 80s that had links to

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,020
data on university servers and it turns

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,860
out almost all of them were broken

00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:11,790
because professors move University shows

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,010
a huge problem but this was in 2010 of

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,110
2005 whatever so this is all before

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,860
github and all of these these open

00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:24,370
repositories that they have now so it's

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:26,080
still it's still problem people people

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,700
linked to one of their notebooks and

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,840
github and then they forget that they

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,170
published that and then they'll move

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,910
their folder or you know whatever else

00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:37,290
the reasons that they would have that

00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,290
these things that findable

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:51,980
all right I think do you want okay so so

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,680
I think many others speakers also

00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,020
mentioned is because it's still a little

00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,680
bit hard to imagine that a pool journal

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:03,830
article paper can be reading something

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:09,770
like cubed or notebook because because

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:14,570
of what yeah it's almost there right so

00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:16,580
I think yeah actually you can put in

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:20,810
like equations right now you can make

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:23,030
pots there you can yeah Tyrael of making

00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,860
books of it yeah I mean I think one of

00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,810
the big reasons is the journals

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,630
themselves they're locked in a hundred

00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:33,080
years of tradition they no PDF and and

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:36,140
everyone is saying well it's static PDF

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:42,890
is so archaic and so there's no reason

00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:45,500
you can but then you you frozen all of

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,350
your I love your interactivity and your

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,960
I mean you can't you can it's it doesn't

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,000
look that good actually women markdown

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,190
is not great but it but it works I mean

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,980
really you're making into a presentation

00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:02,810
to so so I just want to add I think a

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,360
teasing astronomy the American

00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:08,360
Astronomical Society is making it more

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,880
and more likely that they their journals

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,810
as for physical journal is going to take

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,620
notebook more seriously and actually

00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:21,740
allow peer review and allow citation as

00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,600
Bernie has already mentioned yeah I

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,000
think it's about setting up that Center

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,270
yeah so that this is interesting so the

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,450
lead glue developer Tom Robitaille he's

00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:35,720
on the board of the journals for the for

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:38,870
the American astronomy Association and

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,450
he told me this he said he is going to

00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:46,220
reject submissions you know people are

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:47,600
not citing code notebooks or software so

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,910
he's saying we have to give credit to

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,440
people and so that and that's someone

00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:55,730
who's on the journal blood so I think

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,480
that's a big necessity is to change the

00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,450
way that the

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,700
the publishers are doing this and allow

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,929
them to accept because in some fields

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,909
and I've heard this before

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,980
not in astronomy but they won't even

00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:10,019
allow a Jupiter notebook to be cited

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,000
within the paper they take it out so

00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,279
it's you know as a researcher how are

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,860
you supposed to say these things if the

00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,350
Journal article it's taken out of there

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,769
so this is a cultural change that needs

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,769
to happen

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:53,080
I have not heard of that has anyone

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,950
like a proper citation reference like

00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,860
how you know like how you reference a

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:09,860
magazine versus a book Jupiter notebook

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,750
I've not seen it I know that the people

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,970
like force 11 people who are working on

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,940
this they're still bogged down with how

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:18,740
to cite code and software and like what

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,200
versions and how granular and how many

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,990
people and you know I met so I don't

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,669
think I think everyone's like yeah

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,240
that's a good idea we should do that and

00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:28,240
I mean

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,300
right and some people don't even think

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,740
Jupiter notebook should be cited they

00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,500
think it should be a docker container

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:15,020
containing everything so I mean you can

00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,020
think maybe we won't do that

00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:05,480
that's a great question if there's time

00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:08,450
actually also wanted speaking of

00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,600
cultural change the clutch in just now

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,310
reminds me of a of a conversation that I

00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,950
had with Tom of how the other day

00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:19,670
because now for journal papers we have

00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:22,760
this linear hierarchical authorship but

00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:24,770
if you're able to in some way come you

00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,110
know you can look on the github and

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:30,740
knows who does what right like who

00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:33,580
actually carries out what what kind of

00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:36,620
comments in the notebook in in the code

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:40,730
and Tom said that maybe someday we can

00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:43,580
have a more organic authorship and it's

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,100
not just you know the big boss in France

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,240
and then all the postdocs and students

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:54,470
at the end so I think that's also one

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:56,000
cultural change that would happen and

00:34:54,470 --> 00:35:07,330
that's what it's the paper of the future

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:07,330
not the people yeah thank you thank you

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,270
