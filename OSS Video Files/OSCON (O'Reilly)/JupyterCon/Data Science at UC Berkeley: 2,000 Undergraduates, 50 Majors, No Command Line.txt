Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Gunjan Baid (UC Berkeley), Vinitra Swamy (UC Berkeley) 

Engaging critically with data is now a required skill for students in all areas, but many traditional data science programs arenâ€™t easily accessible to those without prior computing experience. Gunjan Baid and Vinitra Swamy explore UC Berkeley's Data Science programâ€”2,000 students across 50 majorsâ€”explaining how its pedagogy was designed to make data science accessible to everyone.

hello everyone and welcome to data

00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:09,160
science at UC Berkeley so I wanted to

00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,679
start with this talk with a quick photo

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,170
and I'm sure you've seen this photo

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,599
around several times today but we wanted

00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,689
to show you what happened at UC Berkeley

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,759
yesterday we this listen 150 wheeler the

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,399
biggest lecture room on campus and as

00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,710
you can see our first lecture of data 8

00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,470
is packed there are people sitting on

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,730
the ground and this exciting movement at

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,720
Berkeley is something that we wanted to

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:37,630
bring to you today so how did it all

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,300
start I actually wanted to ask you guys

00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,310
a question how many of you have read the

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,130
book little woman raise your hands

00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,800
a fair number I'm impressed and for

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,950
those of you who haven't um this is how

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,630
the first lecture of day day went I was

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,790
actually a freshman in this class two

00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,640
years ago when Professor De Niro took

00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,470
the stage and he started talking he

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,970
asked that same question of us and fair

00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,479
portion of us had read it a fair had not

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:07,750
and he went through how a computer could

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,520
read the book little woman so let's take

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,310
a quick look what he did was take the

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,710
Project Gutenberg version of little

00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,080
woman the text and then split it by

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,100
chapter and once they were split by

00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,860
chapter he did something very

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,900
interesting as you can see in that my

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,450
new line of code that you see need to

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,520
create that table he took the characters

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,229
each of the five main characters of

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,240
little woman and took the character

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:37,390
counts for each of them in every chapter

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,890
a very simple data science operation the

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,010
main point here is not the code it's

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,690
just the image so let's take a quick

00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,780
look what so for those of you who

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:49,270
haven't read the book can you guys tell

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,540
who the main character is just by this

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,939
graph yes Joe

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,229
exactly so we've never read the book but

00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,400
we can tell that Joe is the main

00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,890
character in this book because she's

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,200
mentioned the most so the the book if

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,409
you guys have heard of it before has

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,649
followed four of the March sisters Joe

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,389
meg Amy and Beth through the 1860s in

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,329
their daily lives but there's a fifth

00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,530
character on there Lori and Lori is the

00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:16,930
boy next door

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,140
Laurie actually ends up marrying one of

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:25,120
these girls from this image can you tell

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,740
who he marries Amy exactly and as you

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,370
can see they're kind of rising in

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,140
lockstep towards the end and you got all

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:45,220
of that without reading the book little

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:47,550
woman at all what so without giving away

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,520
the ending you can tell a lot from how

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,750
j28 looks at the book little woman and I

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,040
can tell you that sitting there in that

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,500
lecture hall this was probably one of

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,820
the most inspiring moments for me so

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,660
what does the program look like in

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,450
numbers there are 1500 undergraduates

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:08,050
enrolled in UC Berkeley's current fall

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,270
2017 offerings we have a 50-50 gender

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,850
representation which is highly unlikely

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,920
for Casas and stem especially even at

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,840
top school it's like UC Berkeley we have

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,540
a hundred and fifty plus-sized core

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,280
staff of students that are helping

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,830
manage data and as well as some

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,370
professors and we have twenty-one unique

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,690
data science connector course offerings

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,090
so what exactly is a connector course

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,580
it's a two-unit data science application

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,650
seminar like these mentioned on the

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,120
slide here and they range from topics

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,220
like data science for cognitive

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
neuroscience and data science for smart

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,880
cities and their small courses with the

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,070
professor that students can take

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,620
alongside data aid to learn about that

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,769
domain application we also have 3

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,549
extender courses data 100 stat 140 stat

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:56,320
28 and 15 modules which are units of

00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,690
data science and already taken courses

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,110
at Berkeley so as you can see data

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:07,420
science is becoming a huge movement but

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,950
who are the people taking this class so

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,510
actually all the materials are online

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,000
the textbook is that inferential

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,040
thinking comm and we're looking towards

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,709
making this a MOOC hopefully in the

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,750
future and maybe a year or so so keep an

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,380
eye out for that but there is a major

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,050
end of minor program coming up as well

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,870
now who's taking day to 8 um we see a

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,490
huge host of students

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,650
and this class has actually been the

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,340
most rapid growing class that Berkeley's

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,860
ever seen in the history of all time so

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,500
we see two years of data 8 and moment

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,900
figures and for fall 2017 the enrollment

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,280
hasn't finished but it's projected to be

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,610
again around a thousand five hundred

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:55,590
students taking the data signs offerings

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:58,500
people come from a what's question eight

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,810
it's actually because of its some kind

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,280
of there was a lot of classes called the

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,130
one and I know they had a reason for

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,780
eight but I think they've kind of kept

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,560
along the theme the connector courses

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,380
are all eighty eight so why not it's

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
probably the better reason so in terms

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,500
of the years of students who are taking

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,210
it they're not a leap freshman they're

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,400
our freshman sophomore juniors and

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,440
seniors a very diverse class in terms of

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,030
year and a very diverse class in terms

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,550
of experience level for their

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,960
programming abilities as well we have 60

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,729
plus majors represented in this class

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,560
and perhaps the most important thing is

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,750
that this class has no prerequisites you

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,340
can be a sociology major in your senior

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,560
year and I've never touched computer

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,410
science or you know advanced math at all

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,599
and start by taking this course and go

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,910
all the way from not knowing how to

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,970
write a line of code to being able to do

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,340
classification at the end of the course

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,889
so who are we and why are we qualified

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,740
to speak to you today um my name is

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,090
Vanitas Swami I am the head of the data

00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,370
science education program

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,500
Jupiter infrastructure team and also the

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,860
head GSI of data eight for the coming

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,410
semester as well as in the years past I

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,210
just finished my bachelor's in computer

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,370
science at UC Berkeley and I'm a

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,020
master's student this coming year but if

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,280
you're kind of confused about the

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,289
timeline because I did say I was a

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,599
freshman two years ago I graduated a

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:24,030
little early hi everyone my name is Gong

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,070
Jin bade I am also gonna be a master

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,800
student this fall at Berkley in computer

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,780
science I graduated last year and I

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,789
studied computer science and biology and

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,860
I got involved in the data science

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,680
program initially as a TA for one of the

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,690
courses and now I am helping out as a

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,090
technical lead for the connector courses

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,060
which you heard the Nitra

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,040
mentioned so as a technical lead I kind

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,340
of do a variety of things I help

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,510
maintain the Jupiter hub deployment I

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,820
interface with the instructors and talk

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,940
to them about our technology and I help

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,350
build and design new tools so the way

00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,870
that we've structured this talk is the

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,790
Nitra will tell you about data 8 and the

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,500
course in the first half and then the

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,870
second half I'll tell you about the

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,310
student workflow so the technology that

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,669
we've developed and how students are

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,139
using it in these courses

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:14,510
Thanks kitchen so with that let's get

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,080
started how do we use Jupiter to take

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,240
teach data science at UC Berkeley

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,419
so the start of this all was in June

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,389
2014 where the Chancellor the event

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,110
answer of that time provided this rapid

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,120
action call for a data science team and

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,580
what it says is that we want people to

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,950
learn about quantitative reasoning how

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,440
to effectively understand process and

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,300
interpret information as citizens of the

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,430
world in the 21st century a very noble

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,139
call to action and that's kind of what

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,960
started this whole movement especially

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,740
around this new emerging field of data

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,600
science but with it came some challenges

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,789
how do we design a computing course for

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,470
everybody right you see on that page

00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,780
there were people from all different

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,250
years all different skill levels some of

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,930
whom knew programing very well and some

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,650
of whom had not touched code in their

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:09,200
life so the first goal we had was to

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,599
remove this thing that UV and the vac

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,270
likes to call the command line tax or

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,070
what I like to call the setup cost so

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,270
when you're initially learning

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,630
programming and I'm sure many of you can

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,490
code in this room the initial you know

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,349
setting up your IDs installing the

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,810
libraries going through terminal that

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,490
cost is very intimidating to students

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,710
who are from different disciplines and

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,120
have never touched computing before and

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,729
we want this course to be as accessible

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,159
as possible so that's what we use

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,200
Jupiter hub to address we also want to

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,570
make computing relevant for majors that

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279
are not see us on stats which means that

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,110
those economics majors we want to find

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,570
them applications in this course itself

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,920
that they can relate to and we want to

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,709
have course content that appeals to all

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,300
demographics we don't want for example

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,290
only NBA information because then some

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,520
the other demographics you don't

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,230
actually care about basketball might

00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,550
feel a little left out or on the other

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,650
hand we also don't want just kind of

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,290
like a shopping data set because we also

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,670
want them to be real-world issues that

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,260
people can take and think critically

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,070
about the world around them so our

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,010
solution was this this kind of

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:17,070
infrastructure that we developed which

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,410
was done in Jupiter we use github to

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,750
help instructors pull files we as docker

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,910
in kubernetes is kind of a backbone but

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,370
the result of all of this is that a

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:30,960
student can use a Chromebook to set up

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:32,160
their data science environment so what

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,290
does this course actually look like for

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
the students there's several mandatory

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,770
aspects of any course one of them is

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,750
lecture which happens three days a week

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,230
on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,750
there's a weekly lab which are two hours

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,700
every week and these are pretty much

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,470
done both entirely kind of in Jupiter

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,570
notebooks with different people

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,890
explaining them but I think the key to

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,690
data eight is also the support

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,760
infrastructure we've developed we have

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,300
office hours not only from professors

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,010
but from TAS and from tutors we have lab

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,130
assistants helping in labs we have

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,440
designated tutoring sessions for anyone

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,990
who's falling behind in the course we

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,340
have review lectures and extra topic

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,320
lectures which are special advanced

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,510
lectures that me and some of the other

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,890
GSI is often teach and we also have

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,710
guerilla sections which are group

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,580
working boot camps for certain topics in

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,440
the course that might be a little

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,810
challenging like bootstrap sampling or

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,160
regression and we're also implementing

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,600
this new thing called homework parties

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,490
where it just sounds ideal for

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,870
undergraduates but it's mostly like you

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,460
sit down and you hang out with all of

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,420
your friends we bring snacks and you

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,470
guys can work through the homework

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,970
together and the backbone of this course

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,220
from a technical standpoint is also the

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,770
data science library as jorge luis

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,690
borges son said i've always imagined

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,480
paradise will be a kind of library here

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,800
was an argentinian poet i also agree

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,710
with that statement this is perhaps not

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,540
the library he was thinking of but what

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,100
it does is that it includes this table

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,530
format in a very interesting way it's

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,570
based very heavily on pandas but it

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,220
takes away the extra arguments that you

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,110
need that would make the teaching of

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,110
certain pandas functions complicated

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,650
there's also a huge emphasis on this

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,330
class in data visualization so as you

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,740
can see in the corner you see some

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,080
regression lines some overlapped

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,250
histograms also some interactive maps

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,540
but what we also do is use I've hi

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,450
widgets to create interactive

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,760
visualizations so as you can see here

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,160
people are looking in this project which

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,980
is project one on global population data

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,380
on one the children per women which is

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,270
the fertility rate and comparing that

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,050
against the infant mortality rate for

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,520
various countries over many years and by

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,440
using interactive eye hi widgets

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,000
students are actually able to see that

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,640
transition for themselves we also go all

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,320
the way to a very somewhat basic example

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,000
of machine learning in this class in the

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,660
sense that we teach classification and K

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,850
nearest neighbors so in this project we

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,589
take lyrics song lyrics that are

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,450
relatable to everyone and try to

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,880
classify them into country and hip-hop

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,040
so we start by cleaning the data

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,250
stemming all of the words and then

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,459
splitting the datasets into trading and

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,470
test and from there they're able to go

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,970
into feature engineering and choose

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,130
which word vectors they think are most

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,600
appropriate they're also able to

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,910
evaluate their classifier and look at

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,190
evaluation metrics from that aspect and

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,930
beyond that we asked we encouraged them

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,390
actually to beat our own staff

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,940
classifier and 54 teams of students

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,220
actually took us up on it so they

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,920
actually went into a Kaggle competition

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,720
that we set up last semester and they

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,490
did incredible things they took that

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,839
initial spark of data science use

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,730
whatever libraries and tools they could

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,770
find and some of our first-year freshman

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,420
even found tensorflow and we're able to

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,820
get their accuracy up to around 98%

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,000
which was remarkable so it's basically

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,140
giving them the opportunity to take the

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,540
knowledge that they're gaining in class

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,810
and then go out go forth and explore on

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,760
their own other problems that we take a

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,959
look at are for example cancer screening

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,540
what does a positive test result

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,220
actually mean and from there teaching

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,959
conditional probability if you have a

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,380
positive test result how likely are you

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,600
actually to get cancer for World War two

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,550
we looked at the example of the British

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,290
Royal Air Force and how they predicted

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,109
the number of

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,519
enemy war plants so when they see the

00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:24,199
flames circling above the each have

00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,029
numbers on them an easy thing to do

00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,470
would be to look at the max of the

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,379
number of airplanes they see above and

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,809
say okay we saw a number 52 they must

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,889
have at least 52 warplanes but we also

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,539
know that would always be an

00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,789
underestimate of the number of warplanes

00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,229
that would actually exist so they come

00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:41,089
up with their own test statistics by

00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:42,649
like taking the mean multiplying that by

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,869
2 and create a more normal distribution

00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,579
of what the number of enemy German

00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:47,600
warplanes actually look like because

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,329
that's one thing you don't want to

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,069
underestimate and in that we also go

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,749
forth and teach bootstraps and play and

00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:56,479
confidence intervals and some fairly

00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,979
complex statistical concepts we also

00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:59,749
what if I personal favorites is

00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:01,850
estimating the age of the universe by

00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,619
looking at the ages of nearby stars and

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,009
their explosions and with that we teach

00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:09,049
regression so how does this look like

00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,429
for the students they get to do they get

00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,899
to look at some really interesting data

00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,759
sets some really cool problems through

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,519
guided explorations and explorations of

00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,269
their own but all they see is the tip of

00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,769
the iceberg

00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,720
so they say Jupiter they have their own

00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,459
file server and they also see this

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,029
notebook format where they go through

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:28,279
the exercises but under the tip of the

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,309
water is what me gungeon and I would

00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,449
like to give a shout out to UV and Peter

00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:34,730
who helped us very much in the

00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:37,759
infrastructure team to manage kubernetes

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,499
docker ok pi which is an auto grading

00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,629
system that we've developed at berkeley

00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:45,949
and jupiter hub which is kind of the

00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:47,929
cloud-based infrastructure and with this

00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,359
class especially of this size we face a

00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:52,669
lot of challenges some interesting

00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:54,799
problems that we've run into is in terms

00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:58,279
of technical skill how do we provide

00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,439
real-time support to students every

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,239
minute that their server is down or if

00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:03,529
something is broken that's a minute that

00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:05,179
they don't have to work on their project

00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,529
for a deadline and we know that because

00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,730
these are undergraduates they're often

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,470
working at 2 a.m. the night before

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,109
something is due and if something breaks

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,329
that's on us to fix it

00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:16,129
beyond day to 8 we want to export their

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,629
work for student for future use and

00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,799
especially because this might be for

00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:20,720
some of them they're only computing

00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,249
class we want them to have that arsenal

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,619
of tools that are not limited just to

00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:26,839
the hub infrastructure from a

00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:28,879
pedagogical aspect there's certain other

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,799
challenges that are interesting we want

00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,490
to balance the computer science stats in

00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,649
the domain

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,000
patience in a way that's equitable for

00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,880
all of the interesting fields that make

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,770
up data science and we also want to make

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,209
sure that the class structure favors

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,770
skills that they can really use in the

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,709
real world but also prepares them for

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,839
the exams that we are giving so the

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,490
balance between in lab using a worksheet

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,910
and then the second half using a Jupiter

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,709
lab and of course the tests are in

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,899
pencil and paper because that's the way

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,399
we've always done tests but we want them

00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,260
to take these skills also to the real

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,279
world and be able to use Python beyond

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:07,040
that so how do we manage our thousand

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,560
plus active users we use Piazza which is

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,060
a discussion forum for students to post

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,529
and ask questions and instructors to

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,410
answer them and students can answer

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,810
other questions of other students as

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,640
well and then we also use flat which is

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,260
a messaging app and in that we've

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,240
developed in autoscaler broad channel to

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,970
tell us real-time statistics of what's

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,190
happening with jupiter hub and this is

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,410
mostly from the staff side to manage you

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,820
know internal communication and the

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,320
surrounding ecosystem is something

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,360
Goodin is going to be talking about very

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,300
shortly and for that we're using github

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,010
ok pi and a variety of different needs

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,740
from each of the connector courses which

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,690
with it provides its own challenges so

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,100
with that I will give it to Gunjan so

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,100
she can talk about the student workflow

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,810
all right thank you Vinita so you heard

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,260
a little bit about what the Foundation's

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,880
course which is data 8 is like I'm now

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,220
going to talk to you about the student

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,110
workflow so how do students do their

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,910
work in these classes and specifically

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,400
what kind of technology do they use to

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,380
do their work

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,390
so before I actually get to the

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,069
technology I have this diagram of what

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,069
we like to call a data science education

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,990
stack that line in the middle represents

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,550
an abstraction barrier and everything

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,780
above that is what's visible to the

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,540
students which is kind of what we just

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,370
discussed the data science package the

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,440
tables abstraction and notebooks and

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,630
then things below that are the ones that

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,190
are kind of abstracted away from them so

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm gonna focus on that third layer

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,720
right there which is the Jupiter hub and

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,309
the surrounding ecosystem so students

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,690
can see these tools they they know

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,310
they're working on a Jupiter hub but

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,740
they don't actually know any of the

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,720
tales about the the systems we kind of

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,980
take care of managing all of these

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,220
things for them and it's kind of just

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,800
like a black box for them so

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,600
specifically what's at that level is as

00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,980
I said the Jupiter hub that's kind of

00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,810
like the main piece of technology that

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,180
they use that's where they do all their

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,060
work and then there's two other tools

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:08,540
that make up the surrounding ecosystem

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:13,250
which are interacting and okay pi also

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:15,170
called okay so here is how these tools

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,570
actually fit into the student workflow

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,640
the the most basic things that students

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,860
need to do in these classes is get their

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,500
files which are notebooks work on those

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,450
files and then submit them so to get

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,600
their files they use a technology called

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,490
interact links and then they pull those

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,290
notebooks into their Jupiter hubs with

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,270
those links and then they do their work

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,830
in the Jupiter hub and then when they go

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:42,740
to submit their files they use a tool

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:44,330
called okay so before I go into details

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,610
I want to give you a little bit more

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,440
motivation for why we designed this

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,350
technology and and some of the pedagogy

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,750
behind it so these images are actually

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,820
from my very first computer science lab

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,200
at Berkeley the whole Lab was basically

00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,600
just like installing a bunch of stuff

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,280
and learning how to use a terminal and I

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,660
had a Windows computer at the time so

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,800
the whole thing was really stressful and

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,380
like nothing worked properly

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,700
no offense Windows users but it was it

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,590
was terrible so that's that's kind of

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,230
exactly what we wanted to avoid in this

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,820
class which was like the the burden of

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,730
setting up and maintaining a development

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,650
environment and especially so because

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,480
this is a class that's not just for CS

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,820
majors it's for students of all

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,040
backgrounds as you heard we have like 60

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,420
plus majors in the course and we don't

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,230
want this to be kind of their first

00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:35,180
experience in the class that doesn't go

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,860
to say that that we don't want to teach

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,810
these things at all these will be taught

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,520
in later courses in the program these

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:44,170
are just not things that we want to kind

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,170
of start off with in the very first week

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,580
so student workflow I'm actually gonna

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,110
go out of order a little bit when I talk

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,760
about these tools I'm gonna start off

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,310
with the Jupiter hub since that's kind

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,720
of like the main piece

00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,480
so for anyone that's not familiar

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,340
Jupiter hub is a multi-user server for

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,590
working with Jupiter notebooks so

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,840
similar to how you would run in Jupiter

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,700
locally on your own machine you can also

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,440
work with Jupiter notebooks on a Jupiter

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,410
hub where multiple users can be on the

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,660
same hub so we've set up this hub for

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,150
students in our program and the way it

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,560
works is they just go to a URL and they

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,360
just type it in in their browser and

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,310
they're taken to a login page and they

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,180
can then access a Jupiter hub and see

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,740
kind of that standard Jupiter homepage

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,360
so the first time a student logs in they

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,460
get a personal account created for them

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,710
and they have like their own file system

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,770
on the hub and it persists throughout

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,170
the semester so basically what this

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,600
means is that instead of seeing all of

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,280
that installation and setup on on day

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,110
one and like week one because it takes

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,480
forever to get through students are able

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,820
to actually like interact with real code

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,650
and see demos and you know actually do

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,070
things in class like right on the first

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,200
day that demo you saw from vanitas

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,000
portion about the little women lecture

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,860
that's that's the first lecture like

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,600
literally it right as class start

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,250
students are able to log on and interact

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,860
with that code and see all of that on

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,560
their own machine so this is a really

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,180
powerful tool to have and it makes

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,710
everything a lot simpler for for the

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:18,170
students so I'll talk a little bit more

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:21,200
about some of the benefits of having a

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,820
Jupiter hub I mentioned you know the no

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,620
installation and setup that's pretty

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,200
obvious it's it's really nice not to

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,850
have to deal with that in the courses it

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,400
doesn't mean that all of that work kind

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,050
of goes away it means that it's shifted

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,520
from a group of users that's like

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,110
completely new to these tools and

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,990
probably doesn't have any ID probably

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:41,180
does not know them very well to a set of

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,130
experts that's able to manage it much

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,200
better and knows the ins and outs of

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,330
some of these tools and some of those

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,950
people are sitting here in this room so

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,260
I want to thank them for all of the work

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,260
they've done in managing our Jupiter hub

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,080
another benefit of having this Jupiter

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,230
hub is that it's really easy to

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,670
troubleshoot so having been a TA I was

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,320
always really nervous when I had to

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,610
troubleshoot other people's Windows

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,460
computers because I had a Mac computer

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,200
at the time so having kind of a common

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,600
system that everybody works on is real

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,159
because it takes a lot of burden off the

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,419
instructors and the staff that are

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,950
helping students with with

00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:20,600
troubleshooting their issues and then

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,159
another another point that you may or

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,010
may not have thought about is Jupiter

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,260
hub kind of gives gives everyone equal

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,700
resources so they have the same compute

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,750
power they have the same system that

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,639
they're working on they have the same

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,419
memory everything is pretty much the

00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:36,500
same so what this means is you can you

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,149
can have you know you can have a

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,889
Chromebook you don't even need a laptop

00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,809
you can go to the library and use a

00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:44,059
library computer and you're not at any

00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:46,070
sort of a disadvantage in this class so

00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,419
this is really nice to kind of make sure

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,220
that everyone is on a level playing

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,470
field and like certain groups of people

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,760
aren't at a disadvantage based on what

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,970
kind of computer they have and things

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,970
like that

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,500
so yeah that's that's that's kind of a

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,889
central piece the Jupiter hub that's

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,269
where students spend most of their time

00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:07,010
but the step that comes before that

00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:08,809
before they can work on these notebooks

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,690
they have to actually get the notebooks

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,789
into the Jupiter hub so the way that

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,899
they do that in some of these courses is

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:20,059
through what are called interact links

00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:23,419
so here is what an interacting looks

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:25,779
like and how these work is students

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:28,730
basically just click on these links and

00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:31,130
in the background files are pulled into

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,620
their Jupiter hub account what's going

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,480
on under the covers is that these run a

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,919
series of git commands to pull all the

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,659
necessary files into the students

00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,190
account but what it looks like for the

00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,720
students is just like some magic

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,980
happening and then the files show up in

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,570
their account and they can just start

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,130
working they don't see any of the

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,620
details of like how its implemented

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,549
and this is really nice because you know

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,049
we don't have to teach them how to use

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:52,490
git we don't have to teach them how to

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,639
use the command line they can just get

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,980
started with these right away so these

00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:59,120
these are enabled through a Jupiter

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,419
extension that we've developed called

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,250
get auto sync and basically the

00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,889
extension allows you to create links in

00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,600
this format and I've highlighted the the

00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:10,510
different portions with different colors

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,669
so you can kind of see how they work so

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:17,299
this link for example would pull lab 1

00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:19,399
from the gh-pages branch in the social

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:22,270
networks connector repository and the

00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:24,130
data 8 github account into the

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,260
the read URL which is the Jupiter hub

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,190
and it would pull the files into the

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,800
account of the person clicking the link

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:35,050
so what this looks like for a student is

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,580
basically they go to some course website

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,500
they click a link for the assignment

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,600
they want to work on and they're just

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,179
taken to the files in their account that

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,750
that they need for that assignment so

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:50,230
here's a demo of what that looks like it

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,570
didn't start off at the right point so

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:56,860
I'm gonna wait for it to finish up ok

00:24:52,570 --> 00:25:01,030
here we go so I'm gonna click on the

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,620
assignment link and then I'm redirected

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,179
to the Jupiter hub and there's some

00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,820
files in there and I can open up the

00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:11,830
notebook and there you have it that's

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,050
all it takes to to obtain a notebook

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,030
into your personal account no need to

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,920
use a command line no need to like zip

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:24,940
up files and upload them to Jupiter hub

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:26,890
it's very simple with just one click so

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,900
the inspiration for these links actually

00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,940
came from a vision that one of the

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,559
instructors in the program had which was

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,450
to create this online textbook that

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,090
students could interact with and you

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,160
know have have a very hands-on feel with

00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,510
not just some like static page that

00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,110
they're reading and not really observing

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:45,970
anything from so that vision is what

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,460
became the data eight online textbook

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,860
and I'll show you a demo of it in a bit

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,940
it's it's their sets of code in the

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,770
notebook and there's a bunch of

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,540
interacts links throughout as well so

00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,610
anytime you see code you can click on

00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,320
this blue button that will bring all of

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,700
that code into your own environment and

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,700
you can interact with it right away so

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:11,260
here's the textbook and that's the

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,450
that's the interact button and when I

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:19,750
click that it'll pull all that code from

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:21,309
the page into my own personal account so

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,290
yeah this just makes it really easy for

00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:24,730
students to kind of work with with the

00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,440
examples that they see they can get

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,760
started on them right away they don't

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,320
have to like copy paste the code and

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,669
make sure they have all the necessary

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,669
libraries and things like that

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,390
all right and then the final piece of

00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,430
the workflow after students have

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,050
obtained files worked on them and

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,690
finished working on them is to submit

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:48,560
them so for the submission portion

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,390
students use a tool called okay this

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,080
tool was developed at Berkeley by

00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:55,610
another student who at the time was a TA

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,970
for one of the undergrad computer

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:02,210
science classes that class is also huge

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,070
it has like 2,000 students right now and

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,450
so this tool was designed to meet the

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,320
needs of the class which was just to

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:11,060
have like large-scale auto grading since

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,730
then they've added on some really cool

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,440
features for notebooks and those include

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,680
Auto grading for both the notebooks and

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,390
also a really nice submission system so

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,980
what I'll show you in a moment is how

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,560
students use this tool to submit their

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,630
assignments so basically what that

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,460
consists of is they have a cell at the

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,300
very bottom of the notebook so after

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,100
they've worked through the whole

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,990
notebook they get to the bottom and they

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,430
see a submission cell and they just have

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,380
to run that cell and then the notebook

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,670
gets submitted that's literally all you

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,470
have to do you don't have to download it

00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,850
and go to some other portal they just

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,440
run a cell which they're already doing

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:48,110
in the notebooks and that's that's the

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:53,360
entire process so here is what that

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:55,040
looks like so I just ran a cell and as

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,530
soon as that cell finishes running the

00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:01,100
notebook is submitted and what you see

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:04,400
output there is a URL and that URL takes

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,930
you to the okay online site so students

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,730
can verify that their submissions went

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,570
through by clicking that URL and viewing

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:13,280
their their submission in the interface

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,310
and then before I talk about challenges

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,810
actually a little bit more on okay the

00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,850
the auto grading features that I

00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,650
mentioned are also really nice I didn't

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,180
include a demo but if you're interested

00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,910
in learning more you can come talk to me

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,550
after they're pretty similar to how NB

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,930
grader works but because our Jupiter hub

00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,480
deployment doesn't have a shared file

00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,570
system we chose to use okay for for the

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,890
auto grading purposes and another nice

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,770
thing about okay is that it's kind of

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,540
end to end so students can auto grade

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,920
and they can submit their files and then

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,990
instructors can view those submissions

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,760
grade them and like give feedback and

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,600
there's kind of like a whole workflow

00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,860
around one

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,030
tools so you don't have to do a lot of

00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,530
switching back and forth between

00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:55,970
different things yeah so that's that's

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,679
those are the those are the main

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,500
components of the basic workflow that

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,809
students go through in these classes and

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,360
as great as these tools are they they

00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:07,039
come with some challenges and the first

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,460
and foremost being that things just

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,840
break you saw some of the numbers these

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,700
classes are getting really big and

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,059
there's a lot of students on the hub so

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,559
stuff is breaking constantly and part of

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:21,169
what keeps it exciting but it's also a

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,760
little bit stressful at times so we're

00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,740
we're you know we're always working to

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,840
make things better but this is

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,250
definitely a challenge the the scale of

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,110
the classes and the program is

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,970
definitely a challenge that that will

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,440
continue to last in the near future I'm

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,590
sure

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,110
and then another challenge is the

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,600
usability of these tools so making sure

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,190
that these tools are things that people

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,770
the instructors specifically of the

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,450
different courses want to use so this

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,679
this image is to show you some of the

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,690
different connector courses of the

00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,820
nature talked about they range in

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,669
departments and topics which means that

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,840
the faculty members also range in

00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:58,789
various departments and they have very

00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,950
different skill levels with with some of

00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:02,659
the technology so designing tools that

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,010
they all want to use at the end that

00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:06,110
they're all comfortable using is

00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,480
definitely a challenge so some of my

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,370
work this past semester has been to work

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,020
with them and to see how we can improve

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,909
these things and how we can develop

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,380
other tools that are you know along the

00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:21,950
lines of what they want to see and use

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:23,840
in their courses okay so to conclude we

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,600
have a couple takeaways that we hope you

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,390
will carry with you from this talk first

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,039
and foremost is is kind of the the motto

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,659
of the program which is like everyone

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,429
can learn data science it's not

00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:36,980
something that's just for computer

00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:38,659
scientists or statisticians anymore it's

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,730
really something that you know everyone

00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:43,070
needs to know in in this you know in

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,299
this in this state of the world and I

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,679
think that's kind of been a theme

00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,510
throughout the day and some of the

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,130
keynotes as well that this is really

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,549
something that's that's becoming big and

00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:54,409
as part of just like basic literacy and

00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,850
I think that the challenge isn't really

00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:57,740
getting students excited about the topic

00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,750
I think that's the easy part

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,690
as a student I can definitely say that

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,190
the

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,810
these are really exciting problems and

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,000
and tackling them is something that we

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,560
want to do I think the hard part is

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,750
making sure that some of the courses

00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,390
that we have are designed to support all

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,070
these different students so you heard

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,740
you know you heard about the work that

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,330
we've done it Berkeley to make sure the

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,370
content which the needs are talked about

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,440
and the technology which I talked about

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,910
are designed so that everyone can take

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,920
these classes so that there's no

00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,390
barriers to entry and that everyone

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,370
that's interested in these programs can

00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,390
actually you know continue in them and

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,340
and get the most out of them so yeah

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,960
hopefully that's something that you'll

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,950
think about if your instructors and your

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,330
own classrooms as well and if this talk

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,680
has gotten you excited about the

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,590
possibility of using some of these

00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,660
things you can check out the first link

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,610
it has all the all the tools that we

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,560
mentioned in this talk you'll find a

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,200
link to each of those pages on that

00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,000
first website and if you want to see

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,040
what our Jupiter hub deployment is like

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,730
you can try out the second link

00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,170
try-try data hub berkeley.edu this is

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,060
very similar to the hub that we've set

00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,130
up for students and there's also some

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,600
files in there from the data 8 course

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,090
material so you can see what some of the

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,160
assignments are like as well and I

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,860
believe you'll see a login page on on

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,300
the tri data hub site you can enter an

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:29,780
email and you can leave the password

00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:29,780
blank no question uh-huh

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,840
mm-hmm

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,059
yeah

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,800
no it's so I also put contact

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,060
information on there so if you're if

00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,650
you're looking for information on how to

00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,760
get started I would be happy to talk

00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,320
with you a little bit more about that

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,080
and I can come chat after the

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,880
presentation as well but hopefully we're

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,130
trying to bridge that gap so if you feel

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,230
like it's there I'll do my best to kind

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,300
of address that so yeah let's chat more

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,160
about that oh and one more point oh

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,560
there was the zero to Jupiter hover

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,170
guide that was created by some members

00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,120
of the Berkeley data science education

00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,910
program and various other initiatives

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,290
and that was definitely like a really

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:34,270
good place to get started on getting

00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:34,270
your own Jupiter hub set up yeah

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,740
so I can address this because it's a

00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:03,080
somewhat pedagogical concern we use

00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,330
Python and we said also in the other

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,670
intro class at Berkeley the CS 61a and

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,380
the reason we use Python is because one

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,910
the package support is very easy in the

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,590
data science library was made for Python

00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,330
but it's also a very unintimidating

00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,050
programming language in the sense of you

00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,210
don't have to deal with memory

00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:20,000
abstractions or you don't have to deal

00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,580
with insane data structures they start

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,930
by just learning what a variable is what

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,420
a function is and that's what their

00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:28,340
first lab goes through and by learning

00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:36,410
it in the context of these data science

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:38,630
problems it seems not so intimidating so

00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,820
it is not the primary goal of the course

00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,010
but it is a goal of the course so I

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,810
would say when people leave data 8 they

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,040
understand Python very well from a data

00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,630
science perspective in the sense that

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,000
they can do all kinds of table

00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:52,160
manipulations and all kinds of

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,770
visualizations and are ready in that

00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,440
aspect but they aren't full fledged

00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:00,140
computer scientists in Python yet and so

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,090
we recommend them to take 61a 61b which

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,490
is data structures and those classes

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,230
beyond the data it so the scope of this

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,240
is to teach computing in the context of

00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:12,680
their domains and after that they have

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,390
access to computing for itself before

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,730
before we take questions I want to just

00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:19,280
officially end the talk and say we have

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,890
we have a couple more events related to

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,110
the data science education program two

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,340
of them have already happened but if you

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,010
want to check out the videos hopefully

00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,510
those will be up soon and then there is

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,100
a meet the expert session with me

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,960
tomorrow so if you want to come chat

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,810
more I will be I will be available for

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,120
that and I was told that there's also

00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,790
Jupiter user testing tomorrow so if

00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,360
you're interested in being a participant

00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,460
in that that's the link to sign up and

00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:50,090
then finally we just want to say thanks

00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,920
to the many people involved this is a

00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,660
huge effort there's so many people that

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,280
are involved in the program and it could

00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,930
not be done without them all so thank

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,850
you to everyone and thank you to you all

00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,400
for for being here it's great to have

00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,790
have everyone yeah everyone here thank

00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,790
you so much

00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,970
gracious enough to answer questions

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,350
during their talks and really only have

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,650
two minutes to maybe take one or two

00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:21,490
questions and then we'll wrap up yeah

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,490
yeah one and then two

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,760
so I actually came into the class having

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,280
also taken that first computer science

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,109
class and I also had like done my first

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,400
internship and everything like I was

00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:46,000
definitely very much a computer

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,710
scientist but data 8 is at its heart a

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,359
statistics course so it teaches

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,670
confidence interval it's bootstrap

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,200
sampling probability those kind of

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,789
concepts are not taught in any computer

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,799
science class and understanding

00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:59,049
computing in the context of statistics

00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:01,839
is something that was never brought up

00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:03,039
in the curriculum so in that aspect they

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,390
gained a lot and they also don't have

00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,819
experience we don't have experience with

00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,319
tables other than sequel and a little

00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:10,059
bit in like the introductory curriculum

00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:12,160
we also don't have experience with

00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,680
visualization and various manipulations

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,109
so it is worthy I think I also want to

00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,089
add that students that have taken prior

00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,740
computer science and and statistics

00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:22,599
courses are usually recommended to not

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,609
take the data 8 course since it's for

00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,140
more introductory students oh and one

00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,549
last thing those people who end up

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,680
taking the course anyway they get to do

00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:31,299
an extra project which is a complete

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,549
data science exploration of their own

00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,450
from start to finish and they have a set

00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:36,069
of requirements that they have to

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,809
complete but they find their own data

00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:41,069
set they do their entire project and

00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:48,210
they also present it at a research fair

00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:48,210
yeah thank you

00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:04,339
Thank You newbie for stepping in

00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:06,829
actually we need to go ahead and close

00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:09,699
out thank you Vinita thank you go Jenna

00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,699
I appreciate it

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,579
