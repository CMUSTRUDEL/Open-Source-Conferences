Publication date: 2017-11-08
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Gunjan Baid (UC Berkeley), Vinitra Swamy (UC Berkeley) 

Engaging critically with data is now a required skill for students in all areas, but many traditional data science programs aren’t easily accessible to those without prior computing experience. Gunjan Baid and Vinitra Swamy explore UC Berkeley's Data Science program—2,000 students across 50 majors—explaining how its pedagogy was designed to make data science accessible to everyone.

hello everyone and welcome to data

00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:09,160
science at UC Berkeley so I wanted to

00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,679
start with this talk with a quick photo

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,170
and I'm sure you've seen this photo

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,599
around several times today but we wanted

00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,689
to show you what happened at UC Berkeley

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,759
yesterday we this listen 150 wheeler the

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,399
biggest lecture room on campus and as

00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,710
you can see our first lecture of data 8

00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,470
is packed there are people sitting on

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,730
the ground and this exciting movement at

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,720
Berkeley is something that we wanted to

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:37,630
bring to you today so how did it all

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,300
start I actually wanted to ask you guys

00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,310
a question how many of you have read the

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,130
book little woman raise your hands

00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,800
a fair number I'm impressed and for

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,950
those of you who haven't um this is how

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,630
the first lecture of day day went I was

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,790
actually a freshman in this class two

00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,640
years ago when Professor De Niro took

00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,470
the stage and he started talking he

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,970
asked that same question of us and fair

00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,479
portion of us had read it a fair had not

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:07,750
and he went through how a computer could

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,520
read the book little woman so let's take

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,310
a quick look what he did was take the

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,710
Project Gutenberg version of little

00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,080
woman the text and then split it by

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,100
chapter and once they were split by

00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,860
chapter he did something very

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,900
interesting as you can see in that my

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,450
new line of code that you see need to

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,520
create that table he took the characters

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,229
each of the five main characters of

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,240
little woman and took the character

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:37,390
counts for each of them in every chapter

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,890
a very simple data science operation the

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,010
main point here is not the code it's

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,690
just the image so let's take a quick

00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,780
look what so for those of you who

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:49,270
haven't read the book can you guys tell

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,540
who the main character is just by this

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,939
graph yes Joe

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,229
exactly so we've never read the book but

00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,400
we can tell that Joe is the main

00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,890
character in this book because she's

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,200
mentioned the most so the the book if

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,409
you guys have heard of it before has

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,649
followed four of the March sisters Joe

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,389
meg Amy and Beth through the 1860s in

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,329
their daily lives but there's a fifth

00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,530
character on there Lori and Lori is the

00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:16,930
boy next door

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,140
Laurie actually ends up marrying one of

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:25,120
these girls from this image can you tell

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,740
who he marries Amy exactly and as you

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,370
can see they're kind of rising in

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,140
lockstep towards the end and you got all

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:45,220
of that without reading the book little

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:47,550
woman at all what so without giving away

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,520
the ending you can tell a lot from how

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,750
j28 looks at the book little woman and I

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,040
can tell you that sitting there in that

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,500
lecture hall this was probably one of

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,820
the most inspiring moments for me so

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,660
what does the program look like in

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,450
numbers there are 1500 undergraduates

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:08,050
enrolled in UC Berkeley's current fall

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,270
2017 offerings we have a 50-50 gender

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,850
representation which is highly unlikely

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,920
for Casas and stem especially even at

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,840
top school it's like UC Berkeley we have

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,540
a hundred and fifty plus-sized core

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,280
staff of students that are helping

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,830
manage data and as well as some

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,370
professors and we have twenty-one unique

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,690
data science connector course offerings

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,090
so what exactly is a connector course

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,580
it's a two-unit data science application

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,650
seminar like these mentioned on the

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,120
slide here and they range from topics

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,220
like data science for cognitive

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
neuroscience and data science for smart

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,880
cities and their small courses with the

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,070
professor that students can take

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,620
alongside data aid to learn about that

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,769
domain application we also have 3

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,549
extender courses data 100 stat 140 stat

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:56,320
28 and 15 modules which are units of

00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,690
data science and already taken courses

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,110
at Berkeley so as you can see data

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:07,420
science is becoming a huge movement but

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,950
who are the people taking this class so

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,510
actually all the materials are online

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,000
the textbook is that inferential

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,040
thinking comm and we're looking towards

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,709
making this a MOOC hopefully in the

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,750
future and maybe a year or so so keep an

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,380
eye out for that but there is a major

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,050
end of minor program coming up as well

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,870
now who's taking day to 8 um we see a

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,490
huge host of students

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,650
and this class has actually been the

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,340
most rapid growing class that Berkeley's

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,860
ever seen in the history of all time so

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,500
we see two years of data 8 and moment

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,900
figures and for fall 2017 the enrollment

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,280
hasn't finished but it's projected to be

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,610
again around a thousand five hundred

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:55,590
students taking the data signs offerings

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:58,500
people come from a what's question eight

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,810
it's actually because of its some kind

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,280
of there was a lot of classes called the

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,130
one and I know they had a reason for

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,780
eight but I think they've kind of kept

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,560
along the theme the connector courses

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,380
are all eighty eight so why not it's

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
probably the better reason so in terms

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,500
of the years of students who are taking

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,210
it they're not a leap freshman they're

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,400
our freshman sophomore juniors and

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,440
seniors a very diverse class in terms of

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,030
year and a very diverse class in terms

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,550
of experience level for their

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,960
programming abilities as well we have 60

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,729
plus majors represented in this class

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,560
and perhaps the most important thing is

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,750
that this class has no prerequisites you

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,340
can be a sociology major in your senior

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,560
year and I've never touched computer

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,410
science or you know advanced math at all

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,599
and start by taking this course and go

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,910
all the way from not knowing how to

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,970
write a line of code to being able to do

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,340
classification at the end of the course

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,889
so who are we and why are we qualified

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,740
to speak to you today um my name is

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,090
Vanitas Swami I am the head of the data

00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,370
science education program

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,500
Jupiter infrastructure team and also the

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,860
head GSI of data eight for the coming

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,410
semester as well as in the years past I

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,210
just finished my bachelor's in computer

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,370
science at UC Berkeley and I'm a

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,020
master's student this coming year but if

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,280
you're kind of confused about the

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,289
timeline because I did say I was a

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,599
freshman two years ago I graduated a

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:24,030
little early hi everyone my name is Gong

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,070
Jin bade I am also gonna be a master

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,800
student this fall at Berkley in computer

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,780
science I graduated last year and I

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,789
studied computer science and biology and

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,860
I got involved in the data science

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,680
program initially as a TA for one of the

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,690
courses and now I am helping out as a

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,090
technical lead for the connector courses

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,060
which you heard the Nitra

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,040
mentioned so as a technical lead I kind

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,340
of do a variety of things I help

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,510
maintain the Jupiter hub deployment I

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,820
interface with the instructors and talk

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,940
to them about our technology and I help

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,350
build and design new tools so the way

00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,870
that we've structured this talk is the

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,790
Nitra will tell you about data 8 and the

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,500
course in the first half and then the

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,870
second half I'll tell you about the

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,310
student workflow so the technology that

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,669
we've developed and how students are

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,139
using it in these courses

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:14,510
Thanks kitchen so with that let's get

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,080
started how do we use Jupiter to take

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,240
teach data science at UC Berkeley

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,419
so the start of this all was in June

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,389
2014 where the Chancellor the event

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,110
answer of that time provided this rapid

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,120
action call for a data science team and

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,580
what it says is that we want people to

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,950
learn about quantitative reasoning how

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,440
to effectively understand process and

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,300
interpret information as citizens of the

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,430
world in the 21st century a very noble

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,139
call to action and that's kind of what

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,960
started this whole movement especially

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,740
around this new emerging field of data

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,600
science but with it came some challenges

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,789
how do we design a computing course for

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,470
everybody right you see on that page

00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,780
there were people from all different

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,250
years all different skill levels some of

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,930
whom knew programing very well and some

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,650
of whom had not touched code in their

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:09,200
life so the first goal we had was to

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,599
remove this thing that UV and the vac

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,270
likes to call the command line tax or

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,070
what I like to call the setup cost so

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,270
when you're initially learning

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,630
programming and I'm sure many of you can

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,490
code in this room the initial you know

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,349
setting up your IDs installing the

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,810
libraries going through terminal that

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,490
cost is very intimidating to students

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,710
who are from different disciplines and

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,120
have never touched computing before and

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,729
we want this course to be as accessible

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,159
as possible so that's what we use

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,200
Jupiter hub to address we also want to

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,570
make computing relevant for majors that

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279
are not see us on stats which means that

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,110
those economics majors we want to find

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,570
them applications in this course itself

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,920
that they can relate to and we want to

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,709
have course content that appeals to all

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,300
demographics we don't want for example

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,290
only NBA information because then some

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,520
the other demographics you don't

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,230
actually care about basketball might

00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,550
feel a little left out or on the other

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,650
hand we also don't want just kind of

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,290
like a shopping data set because we also

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,670
want them to be real-world issues that

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,260
people can take and think critically

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,070
about the world around them so our

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,010
solution was this this kind of

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:17,070
infrastructure that we developed which

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,410
was done in Jupiter we use github to

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,750
help instructors pull files we as docker

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,910
in kubernetes is kind of a backbone but

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,370
the result of all of this is that a

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:30,960
student can use a Chromebook to set up

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:32,160
their data science environment so what

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,290
does this course actually look like for

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
the students there's several mandatory

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,770
aspects of any course one of them is

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,750
lecture which happens three days a week

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,230
on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,750
there's a weekly lab which are two hours

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,700
every week and these are pretty much

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,470
done both entirely kind of in Jupiter

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,570
notebooks with different people

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,890
explaining them but I think the key to

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,690
data eight is also the support

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,760
infrastructure we've developed we have

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,300
office hours not only from professors

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,010
but from TAS and from tutors we have lab

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,130
assistants helping in labs we have

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,440
designated tutoring sessions for anyone

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,990
who's falling behind in the course we

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,340
have review lectures and extra topic

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,320
lectures which are special advanced

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,510
lectures that me and some of the other

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,890
GSI is often teach and we also have

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,710
guerilla sections which are group

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,580
working boot camps for certain topics in

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,440
the course that might be a little

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,810
challenging like bootstrap sampling or

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,160
regression and we're also implementing

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,600
this new thing called homework parties

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,490
where it just sounds ideal for

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,870
undergraduates but it's mostly like you

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,460
sit down and you hang out with all of

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,420
your friends we bring snacks and you

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,470
guys can work through the homework

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,970
together and the backbone of this course

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,220
from a technical standpoint is also the

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,770
data science library as jorge luis

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,690
borges son said i've always imagined

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,480
paradise will be a kind of library here

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,800
was an argentinian poet i also agree

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,710
with that statement this is perhaps not

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,540
the library he was thinking of but what

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,100
it does is that it includes this table

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,530
format in a very interesting way it's

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,570
based very heavily on pandas but it

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,220
takes away the extra arguments that you

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,110
need that would make the teaching of

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,110
certain pandas functions complicated

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,650
there's also a huge emphasis on this

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,330
class in data visualization so as you

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,740
can see in the corner you see some

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,080
regression lines some overlapped

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,250
histograms also some interactive maps

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,540
but what we also do is use I've hi

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,450
widgets to create interactive

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,760
visualizations so as you can see here

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,160
people are looking in this project which

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,980
is project one on global population data

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,380
on one the children per women which is

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,270
the fertility rate and comparing that

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,050
against the infant mortality rate for

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,520
various countries over many years and by

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,440
using interactive eye hi widgets

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,000
students are actually able to see that

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,640
transition for themselves we also go all

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,320
the way to a very somewhat basic example

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,000
of machine learning in this class in the

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,660
sense that we teach classification and K

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,850
nearest neighbors so in this project we

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,589
take lyrics song lyrics that are

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,450
relatable to everyone and try to

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,880
classify them into country and hip-hop

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,040
so we start by cleaning the data

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,250
stemming all of the words and then

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,459
splitting the datasets into trading and

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,470
test and from there they're able to go

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,970
into feature engineering and choose

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,130
which word vectors they think are most

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,600
appropriate they're also able to

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,910
evaluate their classifier and look at

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,190
evaluation metrics from that aspect and

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,930
beyond that we asked we encouraged them

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,390
actually to beat our own staff

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,940
classifier and 54 teams of students

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,220
actually took us up on it so they

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,920
actually went into a Kaggle competition

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,720
that we set up last semester and they

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,490
did incredible things they took that

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,839
initial spark of data science use

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,730
whatever libraries and tools they could

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,770
find and some of our first-year freshman

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,420
even found tensorflow and we're able to

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,820
get their accuracy up to around 98%

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,000
which was remarkable so it's basically

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,140
giving them the opportunity to take the

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,540
knowledge that they're gaining in class

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,810
and then go out go forth and explore on

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,760
their own other problems that we take a

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,959
look at are for example cancer screening

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,540
what does a positive test result

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,220
actually mean and from there teaching

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,959
conditional probability if you have a

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,380
positive test result how likely are you

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,600
actually to get cancer for World War two

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,550
we looked at the example of the British

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,290
Royal Air Force and how they predicted

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,109
the number of

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,519
enemy war plants so when they see the

00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:24,199
flames circling above the each have

00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,029
numbers on them an easy thing to do

00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,470
would be to look at the max of the

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,379
number of airplanes they see above and

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,809
say okay we saw a number 52 they must

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,889
have at least 52 warplanes but we also

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,539
know that would always be an

00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,789
underestimate of the number of warplanes

00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,229
that would actually exist so they come

00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:41,089
up with their own test statistics by

00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:42,649
like taking the mean multiplying that by

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,869
2 and create a more normal distribution

00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,579
of what the number of enemy German

00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:47,600
warplanes actually look like because

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,329
that's one thing you don't want to

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,069
underestimate and in that we also go

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,749
forth and teach bootstraps and play and

00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:56,479
confidence intervals and some fairly

00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,979
complex statistical concepts we also

00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:59,749
what if I personal favorites is

00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:01,850
estimating the age of the universe by

00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,619
looking at the ages of nearby stars and

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,009
their explosions and with that we teach

00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:09,049
regression so how does this look like

00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,429
for the students they get to do they get

00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,899
to look at some really interesting data

00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,759
sets some really cool problems through

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,519
guided explorations and explorations of

00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,269
their own but all they see is the tip of

00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,769
the iceberg

00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,720
so they say Jupiter they have their own

00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,459
file server and they also see this

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,029
notebook format where they go through

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:28,279
the exercises but under the tip of the

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,309
water is what me gungeon and I would

00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,449
like to give a shout out to UV and Peter

00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:34,730
who helped us very much in the

00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:37,759
infrastructure team to manage kubernetes

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,499
docker ok pi which is an auto grading

00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,629
system that we've developed at berkeley

00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:45,949
and jupiter hub which is kind of the

00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:47,929
cloud-based infrastructure and with this

00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,359
class especially of this size we face a

00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:52,669
lot of challenges some interesting

00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:54,799
problems that we've run into is in terms

00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:58,279
of technical skill how do we provide

00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,439
real-time support to students every

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,239
minute that their server is down or if

00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:03,529
something is broken that's a minute that

00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:05,179
they don't have to work on their project

00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,529
for a deadline and we know that because

00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,730
these are undergraduates they're often

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,470
working at 2 a.m. the night before

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,109
something is due and if something breaks

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,329
that's on us to fix it

00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:16,129
beyond day to 8 we want to export their

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,629
work for student for future use and

00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,799
especially because this might be for

00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:20,720
some of them they're only computing

00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,249
class we want them to have that arsenal

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,619
of tools that are not limited just to

00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:26,839
the hub infrastructure from a

00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:28,879
pedagogical aspect there's certain other

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,799
challenges that are interesting we want

00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,490
to balance the computer science stats in

00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,649
the domain

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,000
patience in a way that's equitable for

00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,880
all of the interesting fields that make

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,770
up data science and we also want to make

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,209
sure that the class structure favors

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,770
skills that they can really use in the

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,709
real world but also prepares them for

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,839
the exams that we are giving so the

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,490
balance between in lab using a worksheet

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,910
and then the second half using a Jupiter

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,709
lab and of course the tests are in

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,899
pencil and paper because that's the way

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,399
we've always done tests but we want them

00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,260
to take these skills also to the real

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,279
world and be able to use Python beyond

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:07,040
that so how do we manage our thousand

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,560
plus active users we use Piazza which is

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,060
a discussion forum for students to post

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,529
and ask questions and instructors to

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,410
answer them and students can answer

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,810
other questions of other students as

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,640
well and then we also use flat which is

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,260
a messaging app and in that we've

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,240
developed in autoscaler broad channel to

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,970
tell us real-time statistics of what's

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,190
happening with jupiter hub and this is

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,410
mostly from the staff side to manage you

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,820
know internal communication and the

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,320
surrounding ecosystem is something

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,360
Goodin is going to be talking about very

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,300
shortly and for that we're using github

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,010
ok pi and a variety of different needs

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,740
from each of the connector courses which

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,690
with it provides its own challenges so

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,100
with that I will give it to Gunjan so

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,100
she can talk about the student workflow

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,810
all right thank you Vinita so you heard

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,260
a little bit about what the Foundation's

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,880
course which is data 8 is like I'm now

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,220
going to talk to you about the student

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,110
workflow so how do students do their

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,910
work in these classes and specifically

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,400
what kind of technology do they use to

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,380
do their work

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,390
so before I actually get to the

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,069
technology I have this diagram of what

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,069
we like to call a data science education

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,990
stack that line in the middle represents

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,550
an abstraction barrier and everything

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,780
above that is what's visible to the

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,540
students which is kind of what we just

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,370
discussed the data science package the

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,440
tables abstraction and notebooks and

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,630
then things below that are the ones that

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,190
are kind of abstracted away from them so

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm gonna focus on that third layer

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,720
right there which is the Jupiter hub and

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,309
the surrounding ecosystem so students

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,690
can see these tools they they know

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,310
they're working on a Jupiter hub but

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,740
they don't actually know any of the

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,720
tales about the the systems we kind of

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,980
take care of managing all of these

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,220
things for them and it's kind of just

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,800
like a black box for them so

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,600
specifically what's at that level is as

00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,980
I said the Jupiter hub that's kind of

00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,810
like the main piece of technology that

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,180
they use that's where they do all their

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,060
work and then there's two other tools

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:08,540
that make up the surrounding ecosystem

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:13,250
which are interacting and okay pi also

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:15,170
called okay so here is how these tools

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,570
actually fit into the student workflow

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,640
the the most basic things that students

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,860
need to do in these classes is get their

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,500
files which are notebooks work on those

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,450
files and then submit them so to get

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,600
their files they use a technology called

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,490
interact links and then they pull those

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,290
notebooks into their Jupiter hubs with

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,270
those links and then they do their work

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,830
in the Jupiter hub and then when they go

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:42,740
to submit their files they use a tool

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:44,330
called okay so before I go into details

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,610
I want to give you a little bit more

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,440
motivation for why we designed this

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,350
technology and and some of the pedagogy

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,750
behind it so these images are actually

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,820
from my very first computer science lab

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,200
at Berkeley the whole Lab was basically

00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,600
just like installing a bunch of stuff

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,280
and learning how to use a terminal and I

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,660
had a Windows computer at the time so

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,800
the whole thing was really stressful and

00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,380
like nothing worked properly

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,700
no offense Windows users but it was it

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,590
was terrible so that's that's kind of

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,230
exactly what we wanted to avoid in this

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,820
class which was like the the burden of

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,730
setting up and maintaining a development

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,650
environment and especially so because

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,480
this is a class that's not just for CS

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,820
majors it's for students of all

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,040
backgrounds as you heard we have like 60

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,420
plus majors in the course and we don't

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,230
want this to be kind of their first

00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:35,180
experience in the class that doesn't go

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,860
to say that that we don't want to teach

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,810
these things at all these will be taught

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,520
in later courses in the program these

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:44,170
are just not things that we want to kind

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,170
of start off with in the very first week

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,580
so student workflow I'm actually gonna

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,110
go out of order a little bit when I talk

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,760
about these tools I'm gonna start off

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,310
with the Jupiter hub since that's kind

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,720
of like the main piece

00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,480
so for anyone that's not familiar

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,340
Jupiter hub is a multi-user server for

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,590
working with Jupiter notebooks so

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,840
similar to how you would run in Jupiter

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,700
locally on your own machine you can also

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,440
work with Jupiter notebooks on a Jupiter

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,410
hub where multiple users can be on the

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,660
same hub so we've set up this hub for

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,150
students in our program and the way it

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,560
works is they just go to a URL and they

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,360
just type it in in their browser and

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,310
they're taken to a login page and they

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,180
can then access a Jupiter hub and see

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,740
kind of that standard Jupiter homepage

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,360
so the first time a student logs in they

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,460
get a personal account created for them

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,710
and they have like their own file system

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,770
on the hub and it persists throughout

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,170
the semester so basically what this

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,600
means is that instead of seeing all of

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,280
that installation and setup on on day

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,110
one and like week one because it takes

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,480
forever to get through students are able

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,820
to actually like interact with real code

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,650
and see demos and you know actually do

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,070
things in class like right on the first

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,200
day that demo you saw from vanitas

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,000
portion about the little women lecture

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,860
that's that's the first lecture like

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,600
literally it right as class start

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,250
students are able to log on and interact

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,860
with that code and see all of that on

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,560
their own machine so this is a really

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,180
powerful tool to have and it makes

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,710
everything a lot simpler for for the

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:18,170
students so I'll talk a little bit more

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:21,200
about some of the benefits of having a

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,820
Jupiter hub I mentioned you know the no

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,620
installation and setup that's pretty

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,200
obvious it's it's really nice not to

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,850
have to deal with that in the courses it

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,400
doesn't mean that all of that work kind

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,050
of goes away it means that it's shifted

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,520
from a group of users that's like

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,110
completely new to these tools and

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,990
probably doesn't have any ID probably

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:41,180
does not know them very well to a set of

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,130
experts that's able to manage it much

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,200
better and knows the ins and outs of

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,330
some of these tools and some of those

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,950
people are sitting here in this room so

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,260
I want to thank them for all of the work

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,260
they've done in managing our Jupiter hub

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,080
another benefit of having this Jupiter

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,230
hub is that it's really easy to

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,670
troubleshoot so having been a TA I was

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,320
always really nervous when I had to

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,610
troubleshoot other people's Windows

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,460
computers because I had a Mac computer

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,200
at the time so having kind of a common

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,600
system that everybody works on is real

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,159
because it takes a lot of burden off the

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,419
instructors and the staff that are

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,950
helping students with with

00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:20,600
troubleshooting their issues and then

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,159
another another point that you may or

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,010
may not have thought about is Jupiter

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,260
hub kind of gives gives everyone equal

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,700
resources so they have the same compute

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,750
power they have the same system that

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,639
they're working on they have the same

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,419
memory everything is pretty much the

00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:36,500
same so what this means is you can you

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,149
can have you know you can have a

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,889
Chromebook you don't even need a laptop

00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,809
you can go to the library and use a

00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:44,059
library computer and you're not at any

00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:46,070
sort of a disadvantage in this class so

00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,419
this is really nice to kind of make sure

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,220
that everyone is on a level playing

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,470
field and like certain groups of people

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,760
aren't at a disadvantage based on what

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,970
kind of computer they have and things

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,970
like that

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,500
so yeah that's that's that's kind of a

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,889
central piece the Jupiter hub that's

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,269
where students spend most of their time

00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:07,010
but the step that comes before that

00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:08,809
before they can work on these notebooks

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,690
they have to actually get the notebooks

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,789
into the Jupiter hub so the way that

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,899
they do that in some of these courses is

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:20,059
through what are called interact links

00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:23,419
so here is what an interacting looks

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:25,779
like and how these work is students

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:28,730
basically just click on these links and

00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:31,130
in the background files are pulled into

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,620
their Jupiter hub account what's going

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,480
on under the covers is that these run a

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,919
series of git commands to pull all the

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,659
necessary files into the students

00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,190
account but what it looks like for the

00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,720
students is just like some magic

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,980
happening and then the files show up in

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,570
their account and they can just start

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,130
working they don't see any of the

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,620
details of like how its implemented

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,549
and this is really nice because you know

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,049
we don't have to teach them how to use

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:52,490
git we don't have to teach them how to

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,639
use the command line they can just get

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,980
started with these right away so these

00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:59,120
these are enabled through a Jupiter

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,419
extension that we've developed called

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,250
get auto sync and basically the

00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,889
extension allows you to create links in

00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,600
this format and I've highlighted the the

00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:10,510
different portions with different colors

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,669
so you can kind of see how they work so

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:17,299
this link for example would pull lab 1

00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:19,399
from the gh-pages branch in the social

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:22,270
networks connector repository and the

00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:24,130
data 8 github account into the

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,260
the read URL which is the Jupiter hub

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,190
and it would pull the files into the

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,800
account of the person clicking the link

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:35,050
so what this looks like for a student is

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,580
basically they go to some course website

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,500
they click a link for the assignment

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,600
they want to work on and they're just

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,179
taken to the files in their account that

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,750
that they need for that assignment so

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:50,230
here's a demo of what that looks like it

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,570
didn't start off at the right point so

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:56,860
I'm gonna wait for it to finish up ok

00:24:52,570 --> 00:25:01,030
here we go so I'm gonna click on the

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,620
assignment link and then I'm redirected

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,179
to the Jupiter hub and there's some

00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,820
files in there and I can open up the

00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:11,830
notebook and there you have it that's

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,050
all it takes to to obtain a notebook

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,030
into your personal account no need to

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,920
use a command line no need to like zip

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:24,940
up files and upload them to Jupiter hub

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:26,890
it's very simple with just one click so

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,900
the inspiration for these links actually

00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,940
came from a vision that one of the

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,559
instructors in the program had which was

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,450
to create this online textbook that

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,090
students could interact with and you

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,160
know have have a very hands-on feel with

00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,510
not just some like static page that

00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,110
they're reading and not really observing

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:45,970
anything from so that vision is what

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,460
became the data eight online textbook

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,860
and I'll show you a demo of it in a bit

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,940
it's it's their sets of code in the

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,770
notebook and there's a bunch of

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,540
interacts links throughout as well so

00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,610
anytime you see code you can click on

00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,320
this blue button that will bring all of

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,700
that code into your own environment and

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,700
you can interact with it right away so

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:11,260
here's the textbook and that's the

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,450
that's the interact button and when I

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:19,750
click that it'll pull all that code from

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:21,309
the page into my own personal account so

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,290
yeah this just makes it really easy for

00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:24,730
students to kind of work with with the

00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,440
examples that they see they can get

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,760
started on them right away they don't

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,320
have to like copy paste the code and

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,669
make sure they have all the necessary

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,669
libraries and things like that

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,390
all right and then the final piece of

00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,430
the workflow after students have

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,050
obtained files worked on them and

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,690
finished working on them is to submit

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:48,560
them so for the submission portion

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,390
students use a tool called okay this

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,080
tool was developed at Berkeley by

00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:55,610
another student who at the time was a TA

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,970
for one of the undergrad computer

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:02,210
science classes that class is also huge

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,070
it has like 2,000 students right now and

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,450
so this tool was designed to meet the

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,320
needs of the class which was just to

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:11,060
have like large-scale auto grading since

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,730
then they've added on some really cool

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,440
features for notebooks and those include

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,680
Auto grading for both the notebooks and

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,390
also a really nice submission system so

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,980
what I'll show you in a moment is how

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,560
students use this tool to submit their

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,630
assignments so basically what that

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,460
consists of is they have a cell at the

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,300
very bottom of the notebook so after

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,100
they've worked through the whole

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,990
notebook they get to the bottom and they

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,430
see a submission cell and they just have

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,380
to run that cell and then the notebook

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,670
gets submitted that's literally all you

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,470
have to do you don't have to download it

00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,850
and go to some other portal they just

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,440
run a cell which they're already doing

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:48,110
in the notebooks and that's that's the

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:53,360
entire process so here is what that

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:55,040
looks like so I just ran a cell and as

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,530
soon as that cell finishes running the

00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:01,100
notebook is submitted and what you see

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:04,400
output there is a URL and that URL takes

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,930
you to the okay online site so students

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,730
can verify that their submissions went

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,570
through by clicking that URL and viewing

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:13,280
their their submission in the interface

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,310
and then before I talk about challenges

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,810
actually a little bit more on okay the

00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,850
the auto grading features that I

00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,650
mentioned are also really nice I didn't

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,180
include a demo but if you're interested

00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,910
in learning more you can come talk to me

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,550
after they're pretty similar to how NB

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,930
grader works but because our Jupiter hub

00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,480
deployment doesn't have a shared file

00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,570
system we chose to use okay for for the

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,890
auto grading purposes and another nice

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,770
thing about okay is that it's kind of

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,540
end to end so students can auto grade

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,920
and they can submit their files and then

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,990
instructors can view those submissions

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,760
grade them and like give feedback and

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,600
there's kind of like a whole workflow

00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,860
around one

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,030
tools so you don't have to do a lot of

00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,530
switching back and forth between

00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:55,970
different things yeah so that's that's

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,679
those are the those are the main

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,500
components of the basic workflow that

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,809
students go through in these classes and

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,360
as great as these tools are they they

00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:07,039
come with some challenges and the first

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,460
and foremost being that things just

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,840
break you saw some of the numbers these

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,700
classes are getting really big and

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,059
there's a lot of students on the hub so

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,559
stuff is breaking constantly and part of

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:21,169
what keeps it exciting but it's also a

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,760
little bit stressful at times so we're

00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,740
we're you know we're always working to

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,840
make things better but this is

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,250
definitely a challenge the the scale of

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,110
the classes and the program is

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,970
definitely a challenge that that will

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,440
continue to last in the near future I'm

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,590
sure

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,110
and then another challenge is the

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,600
usability of these tools so making sure

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,190
that these tools are things that people

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,770
the instructors specifically of the

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,450
different courses want to use so this

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,679
this image is to show you some of the

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,690
different connector courses of the

00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,820
nature talked about they range in

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,669
departments and topics which means that

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,840
the faculty members also range in

00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:58,789
various departments and they have very

00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,950
different skill levels with with some of

00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:02,659
the technology so designing tools that

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,010
they all want to use at the end that

00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:06,110
they're all comfortable using is

00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,480
definitely a challenge so some of my

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,370
work this past semester has been to work

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,020
with them and to see how we can improve

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,909
these things and how we can develop

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,380
other tools that are you know along the

00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:21,950
lines of what they want to see and use

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:23,840
in their courses okay so to conclude we

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,600
have a couple takeaways that we hope you

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,390
will carry with you from this talk first

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,039
and foremost is is kind of the the motto

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,659
of the program which is like everyone

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,429
can learn data science it's not

00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:36,980
something that's just for computer

00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:38,659
scientists or statisticians anymore it's

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,730
really something that you know everyone

00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:43,070
needs to know in in this you know in

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,299
this in this state of the world and I

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,679
think that's kind of been a theme

00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,510
throughout the day and some of the

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,130
keynotes as well that this is really

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,549
something that's that's becoming big and

00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:54,409
as part of just like basic literacy and

00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,850
I think that the challenge isn't really

00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:57,740
getting students excited about the topic

00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,750
I think that's the easy part

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,690
as a student I can definitely say that

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,190
the

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,810
these are really exciting problems and

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,000
and tackling them is something that we

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,560
want to do I think the hard part is

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,750
making sure that some of the courses

00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,390
that we have are designed to support all

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,070
these different students so you heard

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,740
you know you heard about the work that

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,330
we've done it Berkeley to make sure the

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,370
content which the needs are talked about

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,440
and the technology which I talked about

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,910
are designed so that everyone can take

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,920
these classes so that there's no

00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,390
barriers to entry and that everyone

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,370
that's interested in these programs can

00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,390
actually you know continue in them and

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,340
and get the most out of them so yeah

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,960
hopefully that's something that you'll

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,950
think about if your instructors and your

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,330
own classrooms as well and if this talk

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,680
has gotten you excited about the

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,590
possibility of using some of these

00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,660
things you can check out the first link

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,610
it has all the all the tools that we

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,560
mentioned in this talk you'll find a

00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,200
link to each of those pages on that

00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,000
first website and if you want to see

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,040
what our Jupiter hub deployment is like

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,730
you can try out the second link

00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,170
try-try data hub berkeley.edu this is

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,060
very similar to the hub that we've set

00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,130
up for students and there's also some

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,600
files in there from the data 8 course

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,090
material so you can see what some of the

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,160
assignments are like as well and I

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,860
believe you'll see a login page on on

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,300
the tri data hub site you can enter an

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:29,780
email and you can leave the password

00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:29,780
blank no question uh-huh

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,840
mm-hmm

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,059
yeah

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,800
no it's so I also put contact

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,060
information on there so if you're if

00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,650
you're looking for information on how to

00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,760
get started I would be happy to talk

00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,320
with you a little bit more about that

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,080
and I can come chat after the

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,880
presentation as well but hopefully we're

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,130
trying to bridge that gap so if you feel

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,230
like it's there I'll do my best to kind

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,300
of address that so yeah let's chat more

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,160
about that oh and one more point oh

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,560
there was the zero to Jupiter hover

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,170
guide that was created by some members

00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,120
of the Berkeley data science education

00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,910
program and various other initiatives

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,290
and that was definitely like a really

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:34,270
good place to get started on getting

00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:34,270
your own Jupiter hub set up yeah

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,740
so I can address this because it's a

00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:03,080
somewhat pedagogical concern we use

00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,330
Python and we said also in the other

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,670
intro class at Berkeley the CS 61a and

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,380
the reason we use Python is because one

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,910
the package support is very easy in the

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,590
data science library was made for Python

00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,330
but it's also a very unintimidating

00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,050
programming language in the sense of you

00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,210
don't have to deal with memory

00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:20,000
abstractions or you don't have to deal

00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,580
with insane data structures they start

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,930
by just learning what a variable is what

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,420
a function is and that's what their

00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:28,340
first lab goes through and by learning

00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:36,410
it in the context of these data science

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:38,630
problems it seems not so intimidating so

00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,820
it is not the primary goal of the course

00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,010
but it is a goal of the course so I

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,810
would say when people leave data 8 they

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,040
understand Python very well from a data

00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,630
science perspective in the sense that

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,000
they can do all kinds of table

00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:52,160
manipulations and all kinds of

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,770
visualizations and are ready in that

00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,440
aspect but they aren't full fledged

00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:00,140
computer scientists in Python yet and so

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,090
we recommend them to take 61a 61b which

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,490
is data structures and those classes

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,230
beyond the data it so the scope of this

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,240
is to teach computing in the context of

00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:12,680
their domains and after that they have

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,390
access to computing for itself before

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,730
before we take questions I want to just

00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:19,280
officially end the talk and say we have

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,890
we have a couple more events related to

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,110
the data science education program two

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,340
of them have already happened but if you

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,010
want to check out the videos hopefully

00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,510
those will be up soon and then there is

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,100
a meet the expert session with me

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,960
tomorrow so if you want to come chat

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,810
more I will be I will be available for

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,120
that and I was told that there's also

00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,790
Jupiter user testing tomorrow so if

00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,360
you're interested in being a participant

00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,460
in that that's the link to sign up and

00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:50,090
then finally we just want to say thanks

00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,920
to the many people involved this is a

00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,660
huge effort there's so many people that

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,280
are involved in the program and it could

00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,930
not be done without them all so thank

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,850
you to everyone and thank you to you all

00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,400
for for being here it's great to have

00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,790
have everyone yeah everyone here thank

00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,790
you so much

00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,970
gracious enough to answer questions

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,350
during their talks and really only have

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,650
two minutes to maybe take one or two

00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:21,490
questions and then we'll wrap up yeah

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,490
yeah one and then two

00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,760
so I actually came into the class having

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,280
also taken that first computer science

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,109
class and I also had like done my first

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,400
internship and everything like I was

00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:46,000
definitely very much a computer

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,710
scientist but data 8 is at its heart a

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,359
statistics course so it teaches

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,670
confidence interval it's bootstrap

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,200
sampling probability those kind of

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,789
concepts are not taught in any computer

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,799
science class and understanding

00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:59,049
computing in the context of statistics

00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:01,839
is something that was never brought up

00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:03,039
in the curriculum so in that aspect they

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,390
gained a lot and they also don't have

00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,819
experience we don't have experience with

00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,319
tables other than sequel and a little

00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:10,059
bit in like the introductory curriculum

00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:12,160
we also don't have experience with

00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,680
visualization and various manipulations

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,109
so it is worthy I think I also want to

00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,089
add that students that have taken prior

00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,740
computer science and and statistics

00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:22,599
courses are usually recommended to not

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,609
take the data 8 course since it's for

00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,140
more introductory students oh and one

00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,549
last thing those people who end up

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,680
taking the course anyway they get to do

00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:31,299
an extra project which is a complete

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,549
data science exploration of their own

00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,450
from start to finish and they have a set

00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:36,069
of requirements that they have to

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,809
complete but they find their own data

00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:41,069
set they do their entire project and

00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:48,210
they also present it at a research fair

00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:48,210
yeah thank you

00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:04,339
Thank You newbie for stepping in

00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:06,829
actually we need to go ahead and close

00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:09,699
out thank you Vinita thank you go Jenna

00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,699
I appreciate it

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,579
