Title: Closing the gap between Jupyter and academic publishing - Mark Hahnel, Marius Tulbure
Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: JupyterCon
Description: 
	Reports of a lack of reproducibility have led funders and others to require open data and code as the outputs of research they fund. Mark Hahnel and Marius Tulbure discuss the opportunities for Jupyter notebooks to be the final output of academic research, arguing that Jupyter could help disrupt the inefficiencies in cost and scale of open access academic publishing.

	00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,040
I'm going to be doing the kind of

00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:08,629
top-level hand-wavy stuff and then my

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,559
colleague Marius is over here he's going

00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:14,830
to intersect and just to so I'm mark an

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,900
alum the founder CEO a fixture and

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,850
Marius is our full-stack developer one

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,040
of our full-stack developers javascript

00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,280
enthusiast just by show of hands who

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,530
here is an academic okay that's pretty

00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,260
much everyone who here thinks they have

00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:34,400
an above-average knowledge of Jupiter

00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,810
quite a lot okay so you probably want to

00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,550
hear more of Marius and less of me

00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,920
that's good to know

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,239
but so I'll tell you for those who don't

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,340
know what figshare is by the way I'll

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:48,800
get to that I just wanted to set the

00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,300
scene a little bit about why we're here

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,410
why we're talking about what we're

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,300
talking about and what we're trying to

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:59,120
achieve so the idea here is reproducible

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,219
research is really really hard there's

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,809
this idea about fair research and

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:07,039
findable accessible interoperable

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:12,200
reusable research and if you go back to

00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:14,329
the first ever academic paper you can

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,779
see that in the last 350 years we

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,399
haven't really achieved that much we you

00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:22,310
know that's a lot of words and static

00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:24,079
images on on a page and this is a life

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,670
which I'd say is about as

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,569
technologically advanced as any

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,450
publisher is and its words and it's

00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:34,189
static images on a page so it except

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,689
that page is now on the web so everyone

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,459
can access it so we haven't come that

00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,899
far but it's what are the reasons behind

00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,560
that and what are we trying to do here

00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:45,380
so figshare

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,270
what we do is we think about what's what

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,990
is what is everything outside of the

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:53,329
peer-reviewed article so I started off I

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,459
was in academic myself I did stem cell

00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,139
biology I had lots of videos lots of

00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,389
datasets that didn't fit into the

00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:01,219
traditional publication and it wasn't

00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:04,219
because I thought all research should be

00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:06,319
reproducible it's good for the ethics of

00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,669
humanity to get all of this data out

00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,100
here and build on top of the knowledge

00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,960
that's gone before hand I just wanted I

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,310
just spent my weekend working on that

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,080
video and you're telling me I can't

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,560
publish it anywhere so I just started

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,490
making my

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,660
stuff available online other people

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,730
started making their own stuff if you

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,310
build an open platform we ticked a few

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,200
academic boxes it's free you upload

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,260
content you make it publicly available

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,300
you get a DOI we track the citations we

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,030
give it an optometric badge we make sure

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,430
it persists but you find that other

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,470
people come along and start using it for

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,160
whatever they want to get credit for so

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:46,040
we had people putting up posters and

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,380
code and spinny molecules we had people

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,080
putting up some dude called Fernando

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,570
putting up his ipython progress reports

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,330
so people use it for whatever they want

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,510
and as a result our sustainability model

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,790
is working with publishers institutions

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,280
and to some extent funders on building

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,989
academic infrastructure that supports

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,340
these fair principles you know and so

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,260
one of the most recent things we've done

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,550
is you may have heard this morning we

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,209
heard the Chan Zuckerberg initiative

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,519
talking about Jeremy talking about bio

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,549
archive for the biological sciences and

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,780
we have the archive for the physics

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,959
obviously it's been around for 20 years

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,630
the week before last chem archive got

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,970
launched and we're actually the

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,829
infrastructure for chem archive and so

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,750
we found ourself in this really weird

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,090
place where we've developed little bits

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,950
of functionality to provide open

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,230
research information and we've actually

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,329
built this kind of white label herbal

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,700
mini publishing platform that supports a

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:49,280
lot of files and that's kind of the crux

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,930
of why we're here today because so we've

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,280
got this mini publishing platform which

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,680
they use for chem archive so it's

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,290
basically throw up some files add some

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,540
metadata and then you've got somebody

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,090
can check them so basic peer review

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,920
change the metadata it's any file so in

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,480
this case it's a video you can see on

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,730
the right they can edit it they can peer

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,350
review it they can add comments etc etc

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,540
and then if you make it publicly

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,220
available if you if you accept it it's

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,109
published so you end up this is an

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:20,539
example from chem archive this was

00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:22,490
really cool because it went live and we

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,530
said it's for preprints you know the

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,780
system itself supported any research

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,810
output and what we found people doing is

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,639
people uploading their

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,020
preprints but also all of the data that

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,090
goes with it and so when we talk about

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,610
reproducible research this is I kind of

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,530
see this as a gateway drug you have all

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,480
of the files you can encourage all of

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,669
the researchers to make all of the files

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,440
available from their research but that

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,540
doesn't really explain the context

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,040
behind it if we wanted to explain the

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,690
context behind it

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,880
you could use something I don't know

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,130
like Jupiter notebooks that has a lot of

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,300
files grouped together with some context

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:03,040
so I suggested to Marius we do this and

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,229
he's going to tell you about the trials

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:18,760
and tribulations of how easy that

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:21,820
actually was well I should start off by

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,630
saying this the first time I heard about

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,479
Jupiter was back in well actually one

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,370
year ago back in office and that was

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,810
actually Mark coming up to me and

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:38,530
telling me we have to implement this

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:41,830
okay let me say well how high do you

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,110
need I don't know I started researching

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,390
everything the first file that the first

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,860
notebook I actually came across was

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:53,229
Jupiter research reach output by mean

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,380
arcade or Benjamin I think is around

00:05:53,229 --> 00:06:00,100
here with us it's something it has

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,500
actually the best output all of the

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,960
opposite Jupiter could actually have

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,810
within a single file and that's

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,940
basically our test file anyway I came

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,870
back to market talking well we could do

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:17,889
a preview on picture but that won't be

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:21,280
executable okay how much time one week

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:23,530
and for the entire thing well about two

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,870
or three months okay let's go with one

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,510
with them so basically because our first

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,600
implementation back to September which

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,060
looked exactly like this you'd say

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,940
everything looks perfect everything

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,849
looks nice we have the preview what we

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,030
did wasn't actually any convert the I my

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:45,400
notebook

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:48,530
spit the HTML into an iframe after that

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,190
rendering condom website everything was

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:55,100
great until we got to this point when

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,070
all the latex files were basically God

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,440
missing because when we render it we've

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,540
rendered it inside an iframe with

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,660
limited access why because of security

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:10,520
issues of JavaScript running users the

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:14,360
user content that would be been nasty

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,520
impact on our website afterwards we

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,700
started seeing something like this no

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,430
more delay no way which was actually

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,890
because when we converted them it was

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,820
outside of the environment it was we're

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:30,680
almost on our own servers and we have no

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,190
idea what dependencies their work inside

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,750
the notebooks also because of the

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,490
JavaScript being disabled inside I

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:43,700
explained things like this available and

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:47,330
neither the links basically those should

00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,430
be the links within the article but you

00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,710
can't access and access them from within

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,510
you would actually have to go outside

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,710
and I'm going to show you the exactly in

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:59,900
a few minutes because of the iframe this

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,360
is how they are crosswalk actually look

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,870
like all of the errors well we are

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:10,070
trying to we found the security we found

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:14,330
the security issue we basically said no

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:16,820
to some content on that page to sum that

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,070
up the actual issues of this type of

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,960
preview was 40% of the previews were

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,169
broken because of this well actually

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,320
that the user input they said my

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:29,000
previous broken fix it

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,669
you have non interactive world basically

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,440
no execute no executables I'll know

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,830
nothing because we weren't running any

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,820
type of Jupiter service and the security

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:43,640
issues of XSS cross-site request request

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,339
forgery and all of that was solved

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,350
theoretically by integrating everything

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:50,970
we are limited

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,300
now going back to the executable

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,940
prototype six months ago mark came back

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,300
to me and said okay we've done the short

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,840
part now let's do the football of course

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:07,650
she came to us six months ago we started

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,980
to implement it two weeks ago up until

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:13,680
that point we actually was able to run

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:18,000
some different layers at this point I

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,600
think I should actually start by going

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,120
to our actual open jupyter portal which

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,540
is only on our pre-production server so

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,220
this isn't actually online yet but I

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,650
have prepared here in Jupiter demo and

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,310
as you can see I have four files and the

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:41,460
fifth would be the actual notebook I'm

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:44,490
opening it it's welding the entire

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,070
iframe and the only difference right now

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:51,450
would be this button over here Ranjha

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:55,740
pygar it was the worst button ever and

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:59,640
the best technical decision but we said

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:02,130
let's make it clickable and insight and

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,570
overlay we actually rendered the entire

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,970
jupyter tree and this Sun beneath this

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,970
on the back end we actually started the

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,880
jupyter container from the technical

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,640
perspective we for the moment we have

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,860
only ten slots available for each

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,650
container basically each article opens

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,770
up in a new container only for you if

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,390
two or three or five users open up the

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,200
same article they learn and receive the

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,740
same container but that's something else

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:41,670
okay all right now I can actually go and

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:45,860
run my knob and then from here we can

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:50,250
actually start reproducing data okay

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:53,390
right here we're ready to see I have

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,980
this New York image which is actually

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,740
downloaded within the container from the

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,250
actual

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,860
article and I can rerun it I can go

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,290
further and of all sorts of stuff

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,980
basically all the things that you could

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:11,440
deal with the Jupiter we've placed it

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,260
bare-bones exactly as it is we haven't

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,970
change anything within it that layout

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:20,770
not neither the UI that's something for

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:42,540
the future and also I would be able to

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:46,089
actually go and start running some part

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:49,420
late the cart and everything else that

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:54,070
we need we actually have also access to

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:57,370
our own groups system within the article

00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:04,980
basically all the files here aren't the

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:04,980
ones within dart now going the bits and

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:15,070
skipping the demo part what we have run

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,649
everything inside a container for each

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,750
article secured the containers for the

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:23,290
users not to be able to actually access

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,760
with that piece of code within them you

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,770
might read notebook matches the

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,339
containers or outside because that would

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,870
be a security and another thing would

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:34,120
have been for the JavaScript party to

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,829
actually split the domains the user

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,570
content would be on a separate domain

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:42,550
called 50 LAN segments and our actual

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,100
domain would be featuring the actual

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,529
feature doing and right now everything

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,920
was integrated video normal access

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:53,079
iframe which basically allowed us to run

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,750
everything with JavaScript everything

00:12:53,079 --> 00:13:01,660
interactive and we could go further with

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:04,779
the widget and saw it's now the

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,300
technical challenges some of them we

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,860
actually we're able to solve some of

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,040
them

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:15,970
for the moment uh first of all the

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,940
security issue solved we split the

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,460
drains everything was done it took us

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:25,500
about three days hackathon style

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:28,150
basically 24 hours but everything work

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,880
authentication via feature basically we

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:35,470
have all over the Internet how to attain

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,650
to authenticate jupyter hub with github

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,140
and sync the account between these two

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:44,830
but with the picture we had to do grown

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,060
up the scalability issue again this is

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,710
something that for the moment we're

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,790
running only ten containers but this

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:53,350
should become very dynamic and automated

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,810
it's still a work in progress but I

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,800
think for the moment what we have right

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,300
now it's pretty decent full integration

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,030
with the future classroom this is

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,420
something that we really want to do

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:10,450
basically right now only you have access

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:13,450
only to your article but what happens if

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,610
we could give access to a some other

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,810
guy's article which is already forward

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,880
integrate and actually be able to import

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,570
some hope from that part that would be

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,300
cool and the last one was the dependency

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,700
help basically imported we never knew

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,370
exactly what dependencies were required

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:38,050
for each notebook this is something that

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:41,770
it's still technical difficulty but it's

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:45,100
on our roadmap for the future to

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,710
actually not have and right now about

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,660
the future development in the near

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,600
future what we actually want to achieve

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,230
is to enable the crude operations create

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,960
read update delete inside the eye close

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,840
why because basically right now or you

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,960
can do this just upload files on fixture

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,780
you can't edit them what about actually

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,630
giving the user access to edit within

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:15,270
the container and afterwards save it

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:18,940
back as a new version in inside fixture

00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,690
also what would happen if I would phrase

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,940
this I

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,640
have continued Nolan and I just want to

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,100
create a new Jim ITER notebook inside it

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,370
or upload some other stuff from within

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,080
the container that kind of stuff in the

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:37,690
near future will working on to improve

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:39,910
and afterwards it would be a project

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,220
based jupyter container not only the

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,900
article as I was saying but the entire

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,800
project a project basically contains

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,450
multiple articles where you can actually

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,340
think some more of your colleagues to

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,730
actually collaborate with you on the

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,040
same project and it would be better to

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,620
actually have those container is very

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,050
secure that would run only for review

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,360
guys within the project on a private

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:08,020
level until you finish up everything and

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,950
I agree around yourself to actually

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:14,620
publish publish the project after this

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,210
one is the integration with the

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,280
submission mechanism that Marc was

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,980
telling you about and also with the

00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,530
creation mechanism this is two are going

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:27,010
hand-in-hand basically to actually show

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:30,160
this type of thing this is the curation

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:32,920
system curation mechanism for the open

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,090
jupyter platform where some guys buy

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,020
some they have submitted some files and

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,700
theoretically I'm one of the curators

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:45,040
right now and I could go via request

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,380
check everything inside this article

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,460
because it has also description

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,360
categories and other metadata but I can

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,330
see right here that this file isn't

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,880
quite well documented that means I could

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:05,850
say either approve but because it's not

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,850
well documented I'm deciding to say well

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:28,549
yeah really hello hello oh sorry

00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:32,340
it's don't have no idea so a

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:37,110
documentation where is it just reject it

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,850
well as you have and as you've seen this

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,460
is your I don't know who this only the

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,770
pretty we would like to integrate the

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,900
entire system the entire mechanism to

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,070
actually be able to give access to the

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,070
curators to either

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,809
change a typo here and there or actually

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,610
be able to edit the entire ipython

00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:01,650
notebook with what they want okay

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:04,380
getting back to the presentation the

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,909
lasts and most probably mortem most

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,070
important thing would be to actually

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:12,330
implement the feature virtual file

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:17,820
system this would allow us to do crazy

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,860
 of the tons of crazy well just

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,130
think about that you could actually be

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,220
able to open a container using five or

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:29,039
ten or all of your articles within the

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,350
fixture and have access to them to

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,260
actually link between them and do

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:37,919
whatever you want and in the end your

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,750
article will actually get linked citing

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,650
the actual articles that you have

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,380
imported within your jupyter notebook or

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,850
whatever stuff you did that

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,880
right now we're lacking a file system

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:54,090
that's why we're trying to open

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,730
containers only for an article or only

00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:01,280
for a project based but in the end we

00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:04,500
could do all sorts of stuff okay

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,720
other great ideas but these are not for

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,360
the near future it could take us one or

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,100
two years it would be to implement a

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,280
dependency detection mechanism to

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,010
actually open containers on the fly

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,950
without dealing with the dependencies of

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:23,070
your ipython notebooks this is something

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,980
based on a graph system that would

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:29,549
add up and up more dependencies to your

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:32,190
containers to cached containers inside

00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:34,889
our back-end and another thing would be

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,259
to actually start hacking the front end

00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:40,470
of the Jupiter in order to have

00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:42,600
real-time collaboration because you have

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,120
a project but you want to work two or

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,730
three of you on the same page and you

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,009
want to see exactly what the changes are

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,590
this is something we're thinking about

00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:57,179
we're just investigating we're not sure

00:19:52,590 --> 00:20:00,029
about this further I'm gonna get it back

00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:04,730
to mark to have the final thoughts on

00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:04,730
this thing thanks Marius whoo I'm loud

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:10,799
so a couple of main keynotes there does

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,529
everyone love the way that Marius says

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,240
jupyter he refuses to change it he's

00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:19,110
aware that he does it he refuses to

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,690
change it and the other thing there is

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,820
as I say we're we're we found I'll say

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:27,240
yourself in a place where we had lots of

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,690
the parts together that could create

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,840
this Jupiter publishing platform at the

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,250
same time you know we just dipped our

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
toe in it and we went down the rabbit

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,889
hole and found out there was a lot here

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,139
and so this this this session is is as

00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:45,840
much about discussion and so if anybody

00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:47,519
does have any thoughts and conversation

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,929
starting pieces we can take them offline

00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,929
or we can talk about them now cuz I

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:53,970
think we can have some time but things

00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,460
there's a lot of stuff going on with

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,370
Jupiter hub and Jupiter labs and things

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,990
like this that could be pulled into this

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:04,440
my question my thing at the beginning

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:08,370
was how can we bring academic publishing

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,960
and Jupiter together because as I say

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,879
people are already with the thing with

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,190
figshare is you can go upload any file

00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:17,190
format make it publicly available so

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,230
people were started uploading I Jupiter

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,110
notebooks ipython notebooks and we were

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:26,700
seeing them being published of course

00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,870
because it's already set up for non-tree

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,179
you know non-traditional research

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,340
outputs there's this idea that people

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,659
are uploading datasets and people are

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,879
uploading videos and people are

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,720
uploading code so these Jupiter

00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,890
notebooks

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,750
I heard the other day there's 1.2

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,750
million Jupiter notebooks on github

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:46,970
about 20% of the people using Jupiter

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:51,360
notebooks are academics so you know

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,950
240,000 notebooks that's you know plus

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,470
one is the biggest journal in the world

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,669
it does 40,000 articles a year so

00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,409
there's a lot of content there but I'm

00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,299
guessing a large amount of these tubes

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:02,100
in notebooks so like this little script

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,809
that I ran over my data to try and find

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,990
so now there's not a lot of them that

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:08,460
are going to be full articles so that's

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,400
kind of where I wanted to start the

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,080
conversation is do we even need this do

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,030
we think that people will ever get to

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,100
the point where they say I want to

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,630
publish my Jupiter notebooks in the form

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,400
that they are at and that is the

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,039
publication of the future and people are

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,169
going to do that we're seeing people are

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,480
doing books so obviously people have the

00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:29,309
patience to do this we know it's not

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,600
going to be everyone you know there's 8

00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,740
million people using the software

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:38,190
already then maybe one of the other

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,559
parts about this is the one on the left

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:44,010
was a couple of weeks ago in the guard

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,830
you know I think and it was is the

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,690
staggering profitability of scientific

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,940
publishing bad for science the idea here

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,730
being that Elsevier have a profit margin

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,710
of 40% which if you look at billion

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,470
dollar revenue companies there's not

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:03,690
many you know Walt Walmart is 2%

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:05,490
Elsevier is 40 and so Jason who runs an

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,679
open access journal called Piaget went

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,830
on a beautiful Twitter rant and said

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,570
yeah it's all good blame the publishers

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,730
as a publisher himself this is a

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,380
dangerous move to do he said the problem

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,140
is the authors the problem is the

00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,919
academics way to win over your fan base

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,929
but your customer base but he said you

00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,080
know people publish in high impact

00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:30,480
factor journals if we so you saw Marius

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,850
was demonstrating a platform that was

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,070
called open Jupiter and because of what

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,370
we have right now we could set it up so

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:41,520
open Jupiter com has a place where

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,669
people come along submit you're out your

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,559
jupiter notebooks as published articles

00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,240
we have a curation system a peer-review

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
system that people can peer review from

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,630
and then you make them publicly

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,100
available

00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,840
we have free offerings because we make

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,820
our money elsewhere our business model

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,789
is working with the publishers working

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,070
with the institution's so we could offer

00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:05,390
that for free and you could have a free

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:09,660
publishing platform branded like that

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:12,059
the question is what else should we be

00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,850
doing should we be doing that at all

00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,419
you know we you is that something that

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:21,860
should be handed off to another system

00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:24,059
who's who's gonna peer-review it because

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:30,059
we saw a lot of people here where

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:33,299
academics who here is a physicist for

00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:35,120
physicists five physicists and you

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:38,309
probably work in different fields and

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,700
you probably are being here at Jupiter

00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:44,280
con you're probably the most likely to

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,700
be able to peer-review Jupiter notebooks

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:51,179
in physics on the planet and there's

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,740
five of you and you're probably not all

00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,870
wanting to go and sign up and become

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,059
peer reviewers and you probably work in

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,610
different fields so how hard is it going

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:04,679
to be to find peer reviewers on such a

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:07,679
specific idea because I was talking to

00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,970
Adam for UCSD and this idea that it

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,370
merits touched on it as well

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,650
that's the Jupiter notebook and this one

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,330
is beautifully called as well containing

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,630
all the analysis to reproduce plots and

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:21,510
statistics a that's a really bad title

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:23,039
but be I mean it's got no context

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,049
whatsoever there's just big idea about

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,210
fair data findable accessible

00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,890
interoperable and reusable the idea

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,539
behind that is if you get to the point

00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,950
where you make everything fair then you

00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,510
can build on top of what's gone

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,789
beforehand you don't have to email

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,409
people for their data so that you can

00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:39,870
build on top of what's gone beforehand

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,950
but if you get this is that I don't know

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,110
what's going on it's just a load of

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,669
scripts it's there's no context there

00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,950
and we did workshop the other day about

00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,720
fair and we said fair findable

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,820
accessible interoperable reusable for

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,460
humans and for machines that's the goal

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,299
we worked out you can kind of get fair

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,090
for humans

00:25:54,299 --> 00:26:00,330
just about and then for machines you can

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,830
get fat which is findable and accessible

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:07,050
because this is always that subjective

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,610
human element on how you know how much

00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:12,240
metadata what do I need to reproduce

00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:15,240
this or even interoperate with it and

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,740
then you've got this one which is nicer

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,980
right it's already it's got it's got

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,620
actual documentation it says these are

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:26,040
the steps needed to reproduce this how

00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,990
many people here would do this one and

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,730
how many people here would do this one

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,530
because everyone's already got enough

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,120
work on their plates already right and

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:37,080
now you're telling us that we need to

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,030
start documenting our academic research

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,900
in the same no way that we acted a

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:44,220
document our code so how many people are

00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,560
actually going to do that where's the

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,130
incentive here because the other thing

00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:54,620
here is who here would prefer a

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:57,030
publication in the to be announced

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:04,650
non-existent imaginary world of open

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:06,930
Jupiter or nature where you submit a

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:17,370
Word document put up your hands if you

00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:18,870
prefer open Jupiter lies okay so yeah so

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,420
this is this is what I'd like to base

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,920
this discussion on there's two sides to

00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,560
it of course because as Marius said this

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,980
there's a lot of technical challenges we

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,710
changed problems to challenges where we

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,300
might have some it'd be good to hear

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,090
people's ideas about you could solve

00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,680
that problem using this or if you went

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,050
along here you could find this so we'd

00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,170
love to have those conversations but

00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:46,410
we'd also love to have some thoughts on

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:47,730
should we even bother because and how

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,980
should we bother doing it because at the

00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,580
moment the way we're we're working

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,450
already

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,910
as I said any chemists in the room yeah

00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,440
so you can go to chem archive the new

00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,240
chemistry archive you could submit a

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,970
Jupiter notebook and it will handle it

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,460
and it'll preview it so you can already

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,470
publish Jupiter notebooks and you get a

00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,030
DOI and it counts the South citations

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,490
and you can use that to apply for grants

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:16,110
so you can already do it so should we

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:18,200
just stop there and with the publishers

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,820
what we do is we

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,340
we provide infrastructure for their

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,340
supporting information so we work with

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,860
nature and Wiley and Klaus and all of

00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,810
these people and so if you submit a

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,220
paper to nature which I know you all

00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,920
want to do except for the one guy who's

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,510
not scientists then if you submit a

00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,930
paper to nature and say here's all of my

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,800
files including my Jupiter notebooks

00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,440
that'll actually render in the

00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,450
supporting information section of nature

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,540
publications online today because we

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:51,180
support that functionality so two

00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:54,570
questions here how far do we go in terms

00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:58,560
of building something for the Jupiter

00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:01,260
space in academic publishing and how far

00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,780
do we go in terms of actually building

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,680
cool stuff on Jupiter notebooks because

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,870
there's a lot of problems there

00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,600
technically as well so I'm gonna invite

00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,040
Maris back on stage we want to say thank

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,510
you for your time there is a few minutes

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:20,760
for questions if anyone's got any but

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:30,380
thank you very much if it nobody has any

00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:32,520
questions we can also okay my god no way

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:38,930
we all come together we can achieve

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,930
great things not about science okay

00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:33,539
but maybe that you know is the

00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:36,999
traditional model that's very true and I

00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:38,529
agree I think you see good examples

00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:40,599
faculty of a thousand research has a

00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:43,089
post publication peer review model and

00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,639
we also get it a figshare comm because

00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:48,239
everyone will upload stuff to put to

00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:50,319
figshare make stuff publicly available

00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:52,809
somebody looks at every file to make

00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,299
sure it looks academic if you upload an

00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,369
astrophysics free print looks academic

00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:59,079
we're a team of thirty people most of

00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:02,259
whom don't non-film have a physics

00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,669
background so people say to us all the

00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,559
time well how do you know people aren't

00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:06,879
just you know how do you know it's not

00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:08,979
rubbish or how do you know how do you

00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:10,809
find the good stuff then what is the

00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:12,399
good stuff and maybe the future of

00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,049
journals is just finding the good stuff

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,339
and building on top of it or you know

00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:17,859
and saying highlighting it like a

00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:22,899
newspaper and the other side to that is

00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:24,909
if we have people you know searching for

00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:27,099
content citing content that's

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:28,899
automatically a filter if people if it's

00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:31,149
not got enough metadata people write on

00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:32,529
the comments section I can't use this

00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:36,219
because you haven't included this file

00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:37,329
you know public shaming is great but the

00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:38,979
problem we have at the moment is

00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,659
encouraging people to see the benefits

00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,889
of making all of their research outputs

00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:44,829
available in the first place

00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:45,940
so yeah I'm gonna hang around and see

00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:56,069
your talk and see if you can solve that

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:56,069
problem for us no spoiler alert okay yep

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:15,970
start off sort of cuts across right so

00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,370
one of my favorite extensions and you

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:24,100
can install that I'd like to see if

00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:26,050
other things themselves I have two

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:37,720
different modes this works like a you're

00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:44,950
building explains it as far as peer

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:47,800
review is concerned so there's all sorts

00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,710
of utility style it's but may not

00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:57,160
necessarily be the notebook that is the

00:32:50,710 --> 00:33:02,590
sort of paper part of that research

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:05,860
project and in order to peer review and

00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:08,740
I think it's really good to be not a

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,590
technical challenging more about best

00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,470
practices so you know somebody wants to

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,510
submit a project it could be a it could

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,850
be this private public turn around you

00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:21,910
can see on other platforms like github

00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:24,670
or what-have-you where you could submit

00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:27,760
it for peer review and it'll just be

00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:30,220
like every other major journal where

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,200
there's a you know panel of experts that

00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,180
are you know editors on that throwin

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,820
they research later integrated to

00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,180
whoever is gonna look at that and then

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:43,540
need to provide feedback and then you

00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:50,410
remediated and so it it kind of cuts

00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:56,100
against the the frequent thing so it but

00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:56,100
there it would provide a sort of more

00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,579
yeah you could also have again hadn't

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,730
thought about this before but you could

00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:42,919
just have a round one is just checking

00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,389
the code and then round two it's just

00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,159
normal peer review where they get the

00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:49,149
hidden code blocks and it just reads

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,290
like a paper yeah which is a good idea

00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:55,809
somebody should start a company for

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,809
checking academic papers for Jupiter

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,320
yeah and I mean if I'm honest we are

00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,960
gonna continue down

00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,310
my question of should we stop it's like

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,290
we're gonna we're gonna finish off the

00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:46,650
execution well then we might do my

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:54,720
binder but you know so yeah it's and

00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:57,480
then we'll see what happens I suppose so

00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,650
actually was there was a session before

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,810
where there was talk about what is the

00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,430
site of all unit once you get into this

00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,500
space what is the site of all unit

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,420
should it be something like binder which

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,970
is essentially just what a git repo and

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,970
you cite that that's the package as

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:17,580
opposed to Jupiter which has all of the

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:21,030
dependencies which might get lost so I

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,410
think there's yeah the good thing about

00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,600
these file types are making we want to

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,430
make all files executable it's very hard

00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,700
if you've just got a CSV to add on some

00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:31,770
plotly interface because it's like

00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:34,350
compare column a versus column C it

00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,990
doesn't work for every spreadsheet you

00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:40,710
know but things like this if it's dot IP

00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:42,870
y mb you know what it is and if it's a

00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,690
binder probably has a similar thing so

00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,540
you can treat them in specific ways I

00:36:45,690 --> 00:37:03,510
don't know if you got any sauce on that

00:36:47,540 --> 00:37:08,100
well it depends good contribution I'm

00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:11,790
not yeah well that was the question

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,620
it wasn't yes all right yeah because in

00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,750
terms of like the collaborative features

00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,970
and things like that we could just adapt

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,260
that system as the collaborative writing

00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,570
and then submission system

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:26,840
yeah that could take a while yeah it's

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:26,840
all good that's your from yeah

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,200
from experience we fake show the thing

00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,320
we've learned is you need to explain the

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,700
incentives you know people I was

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,490
chatting someone before about the idea

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,380
of sighting people should be sighting

00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,490
content explaining why their sighting it

00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,770
you know you should have a drop-down I'm

00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:02,260
citing it because I it backs up the my

00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:06,010
data or to affirm it or this is rubbish

00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:08,530
but why ain't nobody got time for that

00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,240
it's that you know the the idea that I'm

00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,850
already have enough administrative

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,770
burden anything that I do like that I

00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,320
need to get what do I get out of it so

00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,540
the idea here is that you get citations

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,370
for all of your work for all of your

00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,780
research outputs is a nice thing but the

00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,520
same thing on the other end now we're

00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,440
seeing the funders the NSF the NIH

00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,330
saying I had you need to have a data

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,060
management plan if you just saved my

00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:32,740
data's in my publications you you are

00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,250
saving time in the long run that way as

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:45,070
well I think we might be running out of

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:48,760
time but two more minutes okay for a

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:50,800
what effort yeah so if you wanted to if

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,250
you you can you can go to fix share calm

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:59,260
upload your content make it available

00:38:53,250 --> 00:39:00,940
fun oh yeah you can do it tomorrow yeah

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,710
well with the with the with the Jupiter

00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,830
stuff the point we're at is the preview

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,150
phase the executable bit is on stage at

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,260
the moment so you can upload them you

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,140
can make them publicly available and

00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,690
they'll preview but they're a bit broken

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,100
but if you download the original it'll

00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:26,680
have the original and you can cite them

00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:29,890
against a DOI yep of course yeah that

00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,540
was this was our four we added some nice

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,400
colors and everything this is so that's

00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,829
not live on the internet that's on

00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:40,009
staging it was a hypothetical I

00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:42,109
no that's why I said we haven't yet

00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:44,029
changed every anything inside the front

00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:51,549
and UI or something like that we

00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:53,690
basically just placed it that yeah yeah

00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:58,309
completely know when we're getting

00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:59,900
public it's gonna look yeah but the logo

00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:09,109
opened Jupiter in the name open to

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:12,030
pursue yeah yeah yeah okay yeah and

00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:17,309
thanks a lot for going appreciate it

00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:17,309
