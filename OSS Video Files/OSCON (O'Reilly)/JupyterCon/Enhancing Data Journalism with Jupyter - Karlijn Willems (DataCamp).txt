my name is Carla emblems I'm a data

00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:08,029
science journals the data gap and I'll

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,510
be talking today about enhancing data

00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:13,160
journalism with Jupiter now before we

00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,680
start off I would like to take the time

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,730
to consider data journalism and what it

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,880
exactly means to our daily lives and I

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,200
wanted to start off with some examples

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,200
first and foremost the Panama papers

00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,949
which I'm sure you probably already know

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,870
which is one of the biggest data leaks

00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:36,500
that happened a year ago or two years

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:40,210
ago if I'm not mistaken then there's

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,760
also the tennis fix fixed matches

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:46,280
article that the BuzzFeed news published

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,320
or maybe if you haven't read those

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,380
articles or you aren't familiar with

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,230
those news items you might still

00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:58,059
remember the map that Jon Snow made in

00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:02,420
the 1850s on the cholera outbreak in

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:05,089
London or even if you don't know all of

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,399
these news items you might know one of

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,560
the following news sites or news outlets

00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:12,380
I think that the point that I'm trying

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,659
to make here is that data journalism is

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:19,159
everywhere around us and it has already

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:20,899
been so for quite a number of years and

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,319
in the following slide I'm going to list

00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:26,450
five milestones in the history of data

00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,759
journalism that I think are very

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,899
important when we are considering data

00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:36,229
journalism now nowadays the first thing

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:38,560
is or the first year is 1821 it's a

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,299
Guardians first issue where we saw that

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,340
data was really important and

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,049
visualizing or getting the message

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,419
across was really a problem for

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,099
journalists now you might think that

00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:51,229
this year is quite random and it

00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:54,169
actually is because it has been a

00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:55,909
problem even before that is just the

00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,859
guardians first issue is really a

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:01,399
milestone in that sense that we can

00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:05,899
really point out or single out then in

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,720
1958 data journalism was used for more

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:12,470
social purposes in the sense that they

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,959
try to predict the election outcome for

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,500
the presidential elections

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,200
and then in 1967 Philip Mayer used data

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,519
to explain or give a little bit more

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,650
insights into the Detroit riots now

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,170
every data journalists in the room will

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,359
probably also know my car or the

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,620
National Institute of computer-assisted

00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:41,389
reporting which was founded in 1989 and

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:44,599
then lastly 2014 or the year that data

00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:47,030
journalism became mainstream now this

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,129
year I chose because this was the first

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,769
year that the data journalism awards

00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:56,629
were really awarded to journalists to

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:59,150
data journalists for their work so what

00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:01,310
is data journalism well there are many

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,930
as many definitions as there are data

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:09,260
journalists and yeah there are a lot

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,269
more to consider so you don't need to

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,250
read all of these definitions but I just

00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:15,260
wanted to single out some some words

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,299
that I think are very meaningful when

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,379
when you talk about data journalism and

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,530
the definition of it

00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:25,220
I see story I see data and I see

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,870
visualizations and maybe the definition

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:31,879
of data journalism that I like most is

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,310
skillfully combining data visuals and

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,760
narrative in a way that it becomes a

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,709
meaningful data story so you have those

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,900
three components in a definition that

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:45,560
doesn't consider time constraints as

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,290
some do which is data a data journalism

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,079
on a deadline which can be the case but

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,590
in most cases let's be fair it isn't

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,699
like that

00:03:51,590 --> 00:04:00,109
and yeah I think a more general

00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:03,859
definition fits well in this case also

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,989
note that data story there there is sort

00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,970
of a link with data storytelling and its

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,329
importance for data science but I'll

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,239
come back to that in a bit

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:16,549
and then yeah this is just an example to

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,370
show you that the combination of data

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,530
visuals and the narrative can be in in

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,779
any possible form so you have this

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,000
website where you take some input from

00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:28,280
your user and according to that input

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,030
you'll give some more explanations

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,240
a more storytelling on in this case the

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,250
most dangerous professions in the US but

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,860
it doesn't always need to be a web page

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,530
you can also just have a regular article

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,669
like you see in the newspaper or on a

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,419
new site or even an infographic that is

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:54,169
also a combination of all three of them

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,850
now these three elements are also they

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,100
come back in the definitions but they

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,260
also come back in the job positions that

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,260
you see that are open in news outlets

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,960
where they ask for coding acumen design

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,640
and then yeah

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,530
journalism skills so these three things

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,200
they come back and I really want to

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,030
emphasize that throughout my talk as

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,790
well

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:20,919
now these articles are the product of a

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:24,620
workflow and in 2013 Simon Rogers

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:27,160
presented or proposed one workflow for

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,639
data journalists maybe you all know it

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,919
it's basically gathering data then using

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,520
spreadsheets to gather that data doing

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,410
some calculations on it and then going

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,370
with the output to wherever your readers

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:47,110
are your users are now it might just be

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:50,300
me and working at a data science company

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,530
but I think that it's really similar to

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,360
this workflow which you might also know

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,840
and which was proposed only a year ago

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,270
you take data you collect it then you

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,890
transform visualize the model is in such

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,840
a way that you actually gain

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:09,229
understanding about it and then you

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,600
communicate your results so I really

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:16,160
want to make that parallel very clear or

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,820
at least it is so for me and then as we

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,490
are talking about parallels I also want

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,950
to draw your attention that this article

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,780
or any article it that is produced as a

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,280
part of the data science or the data

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:34,220
journalism workflow and the jupiter

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,280
notebook share these elements that I

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,470
talked about earlier data visuals and

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,080
the narrative and I think it's very

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,580
clear that if you want to do data

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,789
journalism and you really want to make

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,310
the most out of it you should try to use

00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:52,340
two paternal books in such a way that it

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:57,710
becomes really open to anybody but

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,870
that's part four for my next section so

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,729
yeah building a data story how do you go

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,860
about it and how can the Jupiter

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,879
notebook help since the two are so

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,639
perfect for each other how do you start

00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,409
now getting the data that's one thing

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,229
that I won't be covering in this

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:18,349
presentation but when you do start there

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:21,729
is one apparent trap or pitfall the data

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:25,460
journalists often encounter and that is

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:27,620
yeah you have the data and you sort of

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,349
get lost in your data you don't explore

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,360
it and you just you you depart a little

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,789
bit more from the story rather than your

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,279
data and I think that the Jupiter note

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,009
book really helps you to focus on the

00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,050
data and to analyze and explore it and

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,849
to really find your outliers and

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,310
everything that you need to know to gain

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:49,069
understanding about your topic that

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,659
you're dealing with and especially I

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,270
want to draw your attention to the

00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:54,949
magics that are used here I think I

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,110
think it won't be new for those who have

00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,990
been using the Jupiter notebook for a

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,810
while now but this is also very handy

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,120
not only to do exploratory data analysis

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,849
but especially when you're doing data

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,889
data journalism on a deadline as you can

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:17,750
well imagine and then there is this case

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:20,360
which I want to highlight it's an

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,569
article maybe you already know it it's

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:28,940
about it's written by Walt iki and

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:31,819
published for 538 in which women in the

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,039
film industry are the topic that is

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,649
being dealt with it was published in

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,599
2014 now why this article is so

00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,909
important to me when I'm talking about

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,159
Jupiter notebooks and data journalism is

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,470
because this was really a milestone

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:50,540
because another journalist Brian Keegan

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,600
noticed that the analysis was

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,900
irreproducible so what did he do he made

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,180
a Jupiter notebook the first

00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,250
one that I can remember at least that

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,440
really dealt that try to reproduce the

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,190
analysis came to a couple of other

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,140
conclusions and then really openly

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,420
discussed these analyses and these

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,450
discussions with the original author and

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,300
this will become much more important in

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,280
the rest of the presentation where I'm

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,880
actually working towards a public

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,160
powered model of data journalism so you

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,080
see the the jupiter notebook is not only

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,480
good for when you're exploring data but

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,350
definitely for the reproducibility of

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:36,400
data journalism which as of 2014 was was

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,230
much more apparent after this case news

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,550
outlets started publishing their data

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,350
their analyses on github and as we know

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,350
now we know it now there is even a

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,730
package for 538 in our package so there

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,420
a lot of things have already been

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,940
changed something that data journalists

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,280
don't often use but which i think that

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,970
you can certainly have its merits is the

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,530
watermark yeah i don't really see it a

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,080
lot in jupiter notebooks that are being

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,960
shared on github but i think we should

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,310
start doing that because of the obvious

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,650
information that you give to other users

00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:17,580
to reproduce your analysis and to really

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:21,880
get started with data journalism as well

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,220
now something that most of you who work

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,410
with jupiter notebooks will also know is

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,810
that you can easily add visuals to it i

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,270
don't need to explain the importance of

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,580
visuals in data journalism they are

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,580
there to support the story to give extra

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,160
context to your data and you don't get

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:43,170
lost to with your data you actually tell

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,460
a story but more than the general

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,320
libraries that you might know the python

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,530
libraries or the are libraries you also

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,390
have the widgets which really make the

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:56,250
story a lot more interactive you give

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:59,140
the user some input to the story and

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,000
yeah it will just it will increase

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,470
engagement with your story which is

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,620
really important i think when you're

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,630
doing data journalism and then the last

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,310
thing is that you can obviously add

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,920
images or

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,050
and before us to your notebook which

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,589
will also add to the general experience

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:20,940
of of your notebook and of your reader

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:25,510
of the story everything actually and

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:28,079
then the last part the narrative I feel

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,699
it's often overlooked the narrative

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,180
especially when notebooks are shared

00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:37,839
across social media I'm talking about

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:40,120
data journalism notebooks you see a lot

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,889
of the analysis you see a lot of code

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,370
but you don't really see a lot of

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:47,980
narrative and there are some data story

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:52,000
typology that you can follow like this

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:55,029
one from Andrew flowers but rather than

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
following those type ologies I actually

00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:01,600
advocate an approach that takes into

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,769
account narrative theory because as

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,410
Aristotle already saw or noticed way

00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:10,420
back in the days the plot is really the

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,190
most important in a story or in a drama

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:17,050
wherever whatever you're talking about

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:19,269
and it's a unified sequence of events

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,160
that has a causal relationship now that

00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:24,550
might sign it seemed really theoretical

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,620
so that's why I'm talking or I'm really

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,380
giving this example of fret experiment

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,740
which actually builds on Aristotle's

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,740
narrative theory and talks about

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,199
exposing your story then having a rising

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,740
action climax falling action and in Dana

00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:43,959
MoMA or conclusion now this is really a

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,959
fancy drawing for saying your body your

00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:50,980
story should have a beginning a body and

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,139
an end seems really simple but it's

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,810
often overlooked and I think that if you

00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,970
try to follow this type of approach

00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,260
you'll always be there and you'll make

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,810
sure that you don't jump to conclusions

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,110
that you give enough context for your

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:08,019
story and that yeah you you will just

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:12,329
not miss that type of the story that you

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:14,649
really need to talk to your readers

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:17,649
another couple of concepts that are

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:19,779
really nice to have in mind when you're

00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:22,120
talking about narrative and especially

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,460
for the Jupiter notebook which is really

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,589
a nice environment to really work with

00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,330
that it's focalization or the

00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,460
perspective from which you want to tell

00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,400
your story

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,460
temporalities do I want to narrate my or

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,820
build my story in a more sequence

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,850
sequential way or do I want to jump in

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,670
make jumps in time and then the last

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:48,160
part my mazes or da gears is also a very

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,760
theoretical concept only to show you the

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,200
difference between showing and telling

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,420
sometimes showing is a lot more

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,460
important than telling everything and

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,320
that's especially true when you're

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,970
working with visuals in the Jupiter

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,380
notebook where you can actually give the

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:07,870
user the chance to to input some things

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,790
or to change around some things and then

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:14,680
you actually show instead of tell some

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,000
extra stuff that are really important

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,150
when you're working with a jupiter

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,730
notebook in data journalism are

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,490
dispelled check extension for example

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,060
and the numerous output options that you

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,610
might want to make use of I think

00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,170
Pelican is by far one of the most

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:37,390
favorite options as a data journalist

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,940
especially because a lot of data

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,760
journalists still operate individually

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,730
rather than in teams so they have their

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:50,020
own portfolio and their the Pelican

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:54,160
might really come in handy and then as a

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:56,730
last thing to mention I want to really

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,400
make sure that I mentioned and be dime

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:03,850
which is a way of collaborating for data

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,820
journalists but also data scientists I

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,260
think we data journalists can make use

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:12,820
of that a little bit more to work

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:15,640
together and with this I want to evolve

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,950
more towards a public powered model of

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,850
data journalism now this public powered

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:24,130
model might seem a little bit strange

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:27,100
but it really resides in the larger

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:31,480
space of data activism which uses data

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,360
for a social good or open source

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,310
movements hacker movements it all

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,610
resides in that

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:40,649
and what it boils down to is that maybe

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,709
you won't realize it but a lot of the

00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:45,360
stories come from just stories that you

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:49,079
have in mind and then you go and look

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,660
for the data now data journalists they

00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,970
can also make use of that story and

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,699
really make sure that they ask for input

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,259
from users who might not be technically

00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:01,370
school but that doesn't matter

00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:05,910
just ask input from your readers and

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:09,749
then go beyond that but that's something

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:12,449
that the next slide will really show a

00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:14,850
little bit more clearly so this is

00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:16,649
actually design thinking you see all of

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,220
these things you start with empathize

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:22,889
id8 a fine and so on and I think that

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,639
also in this the Jupiter notebook will

00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:29,939
come in handy because you can use it to

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,009
really ask your readers the questions

00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:34,050
that you want to know what are they

00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:37,040
interested in reading you have a topic

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,120
let's say the crisis you ask your users

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,769
what questions

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,250
are you most interested in getting

00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:47,790
answers to and you can really collect

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,769
all of those feedback into your Jupiter

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,480
notebook or in a regular text file which

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,329
do you put your notebook application

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,449
also offers and then prototype and test

00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:59,160
the things that you want to be testing

00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,709
or that or the answers that you want to

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,689
be giving in the Jupiter notebook and

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:05,689
then repeat that process all over again

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:14,459
now the public powered model of data

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,919
journalism is about collaborating maybe

00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,539
not with technically schooled users but

00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,470
definitely with all people that are

00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,179
interested in collaborating and there

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,449
are still a lot of things that we can

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:31,679
work on to make that happen being a part

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:33,750
of Education and data science education

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,700
I still feel that there is a need to

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,690
work on that or to at least focus on

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,090
that because you have a lot of

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,799
journalists we're looking to turn to

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,630
data journalism but that don't really

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,460
have the background in statistics or

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,429
that don't really know how to get

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,630
started so in order for us to evolve to

00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:51,530
that public power

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,870
we need to focus a lot more on education

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:57,600
but also collaboration as I said before

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:01,140
a lot of data journalists operate alone

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,450
they have their portfolio they work as a

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,690
freelance for other news outlets and

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,760
there is not so much collaboration okay

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,070
you have the Panama papers where a lot

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,200
of newsrooms work together in the sense

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,880
that they analyze the data but the

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,730
stories they all were published in

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,220
separate news outlets there wasn't one

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,620
real story I mean there is a website but

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,610
you still see what I'm saying there was

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:29,039
a lot of separate divergence but in

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,919
between the newsrooms themselves and

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,710
then the last part of this reprobate

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,669
I think I focused a lot on that but it

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:41,010
still remains an issue it has been since

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:43,559
2014 for data journalism and it will

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,940
still remain a focal point for the

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,700
future

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,789
I think Jupiter and the advances that

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,809
it's making will definitely help us data

00:18:50,789 --> 00:19:17,580
journalists to make this happen thank

00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:19,200
you any questions no I haven't I have

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,240
written a lot of articles but I haven't

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,240
done any physical training

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:36,300
I think there are already a lot of

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,280
journalists that are aware that they

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,410
need to be using other tools besides the

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,360
ones that they are currently using

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,370
they are definitely aware that they need

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,860
to change stuff in the educational

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,990
programs at school but I'm not sure if

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,420
the Jupiter notebook is really used to

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,580
that extent like the most things that

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,740
you will see in any journalism program

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,380
at the moment is just a basic intro to

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,330
Python or R and then if you're very

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,420
lucky maybe they'll mention it should be

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:06,950
their notebook but I think that there is

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,950
still a lot of work there yeah

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,860
mm-hmm

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,830
mm-hm

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,830
yeah

00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,160
that's yeah it's very interesting that

00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,049
you mentioned that because at least in

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,020
the context that I'm operating and in

00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:51,669
Belgium it's yeah I think there are

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,950
really a lot of stubs that can still be

00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:55,540
taken I think I don't think that the

00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,130
journalism programs at this point even

00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:01,750
do what your school is doing or yeah I

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:05,770
think we still have a long way to go up

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:08,400
especially in in Belgium then yeah it's

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,400
great to hear

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:42,480
I think that's an interesting idea to

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,440
shift that balance a little bit I think

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,300
most of it the fact that were we have a

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,310
story and that we go and look for the

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,590
data afterwards also originates from the

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,360
fact that most of us are traditionally

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,910
schooled in the sense that we learn to

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,950
code later so we have the story in mind

00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,680
and then we we need to get some proof

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,660
but as we go along and we we have this

00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,180
education with which continues to

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,980
improve data journalists or journalists

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,870
in itself will be better trained and

00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,590
occupied to get hands-on with the data

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,570
first and then get the story out there

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,220
so yeah I hope in the future that it

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,760
will be a little bit the other way

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,500
around

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,230
of course it will still be data

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,900
journalism so I don't think that we can

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:28,080
totally move away from having story

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,490
first and then going to the data I hope

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,490
it will be 6040

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:48,510
excuse me my work at data camp I usually

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,390
focus on data science so we have a

00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,520
community a data camp and I'm always

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:58,020
looking for guest contributors if you're

00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:01,320
interested and my work is basically I

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,900
work a lot with our markdown and then

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,560
the Jupiter notebook to write tutorials

00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:10,920
for people who are just starting out but

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,720
I mean recently I've also have been

00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,910
writing a lot of definitive guides to

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,560
for example the Jupiter notebook or

00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,860
explaining the difference between

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:24,210
ipython or Jupiter in that sense my work

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,920
is less novelty oriented and more making

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,170
sure that everybody understands what

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,780
what is out there so I'm taking the

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:38,990
educational perspective with my work yes

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:41,730
I have a question I have a friend whose

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,830
works at a newspaper and a lot of her

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:47,310
challenges seems to be like IT related

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:49,650
in a way like she like has to stand up

00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,420
like she has become an IT person like

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:56,370
has to stand up servers or a database

00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,770
for people to even work on if you have

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,070
any thoughts about like kind of the

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:03,270
infrastructure side of data journalism

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,310
yeah specifically about the

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,110
infrastructure I'm not really trained to

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,810
do that but I can tell you that it's an

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,910
issue that occurs worldwide because if

00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,310
you have one person that is a little bit

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,770
schooled even they will ask you anything

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,750
it's like when you study Computer

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,580
Sciences everybody will ask you to fix

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,740
our computer whatever their problem is

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,960
and you see the same thing occurring in

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,630
data journalism one person knows how to

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,730
tell a story and knows how to analyze

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,800
data and all of a sudden you're in

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:36,060
charge of the whole IT department at

00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,940
your newspaper yeah I don't have any

00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,010
ideas on the infrastructure itself but I

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,740
do think that it will improve in the

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,140
future as we really make sure that we

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,180
educate people well and make sure that

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,860
the importance of data journalism and

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,279
the difference between data journalism

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,830
and

00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,989
tea becomes a little bit more clear in

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,580
the newsroom and the people deciding on

00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:58,580
on the team composition

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:24,660
at this point there aren't really a lot

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,850
of best practices as far as I know as I

00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,280
said a lot of people or a lot of data

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,130
journalists operate individually so

00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:38,520
whatever that individuals preferences

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:40,650
that will be mostly the way to go I do

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,080
think that we can work towards unifying

00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:47,250
that a little bit more but it's also

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:50,340
because there are some yeah I would say

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,230
that we can really as with in data

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,690
journalism I think we can focus more on

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,909
getting tools like the Jupiter notebook

00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,830
out there because I think a lot of

00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:00,900
journalists use it but then not to the

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,820
full extent that they should be using it

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,220
which is also something that I briefly

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,530
mentioned in the presentation with the

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,270
water print for example I don't see that

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,880
anywhere and I think it would be really

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,059
useful for people to see those type of

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,059
things

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:36,770
I think it's a combination of both but

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,720
first and foremost from what I have read

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:42,230
and from what I've seen in the data

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:47,660
journalism space I think it's mostly a

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:50,180
problem of Education I literally saw

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,920
seen a tweet on Twitter of somebody

00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,770
saying I wish I had taken some

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,830
statistics classes when I was actually

00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:01,400
studying because I am using it way more

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,140
often than I and I think I would needed

00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,030
it or then I thought back then that I

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,260
would have needed it so I think that

00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:11,150
like I think most journalists that are

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,250
working in the space realize that they

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,020
need to step up their game and I think

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,930
that the education is still lagging

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:20,180
behind a little bit in making sure that

00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,220
journalists are better equipped to deal

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,610
with the challenges that the data brings

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,610
to them

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,640
yeah

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,090
mm-hmm

00:28:03,350 --> 00:29:01,370
yeah I can't really comment on that yeah

00:28:07,280 --> 00:29:03,730
I think it's a great suggestion yeah and

00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,570
and on that topic like the Jupiter

00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,700
developers are here doing user testing

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,860
like just down the hall if you wanted to

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,860
go like give them directly some feedback

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:18,070
we have time for more questions there

00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,070
any more questions for Colleen

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,610
yeah I can mostly talk for data

00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:02,010
journalism and I also said like I don't

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,170
really see a lot of narrative being used

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,350
in the Jupiter notebooks as much as they

00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:09,420
could could have been I think it's

00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,430
definitely something to work on but

00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,710
there aren't any standards that people

00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,390
are following at this point sometimes in

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,580
the github repositories you see you just

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,250
see the analysis sometimes you just see

00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,610
one sentence I think there's a lot of

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:26,160
things that we can still improve yeah so

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:29,370
yeah I can't really comment on that like

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:39,690
since there aren't any standards there

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:42,090
don't seem to be there is a dated data

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:45,780
journalism handbook which I find really

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,640
nice but there is as far as I know the

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,830
only github repository that I find

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:55,530
really interesting to look at is the one

00:30:49,830 --> 00:31:00,570
of Brian Keegan where he actually does

00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:07,430
use the narrative to really go into the

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:07,430
analysis so this one the right hand side

00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,520
okay thank you

00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:36,080
yeah my thoughts on that is first and

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,390
foremost great suggestion

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,220
I think it sounds great I haven't heard

00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:45,770
of it personally I I do think that it

00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,780
should be I mean also thinking from the

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,970
open source movement I do think that it

00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,010
should be possible to have translations

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,570
of the same material also because

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,700
normally the copyright still is

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,470
respected I mean the article still

00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,420
belongs to you and if you give

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,280
permission as an author to have your

00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,370
article translated that shouldn't be any

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,040
problem I I do know about data

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:10,880
visualizations of one data journalist in

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,740
Belgium who made this this data

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,890
visualization and then it got translated

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,950
by other news outlets so I do think that

00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:22,550
people still do it but maybe not as much

00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:25,010
as they could be doing and this is just

00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:28,100
for a data visualization so it's it's

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:31,180
not for an article but I do think that

00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,180
it should be possible yes

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,530
all right if there are no more questions

00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:45,319
let's think I'll and again

00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:45,319
