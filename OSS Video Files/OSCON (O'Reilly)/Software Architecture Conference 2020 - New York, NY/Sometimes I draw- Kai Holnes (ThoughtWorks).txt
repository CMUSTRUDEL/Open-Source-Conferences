Being a developer in today’s world means living and breathing technology whether it’s designing new systems or critiquing the design of your doctor’s scheduling web app (if they have one, that is). In the few moments in between, there isn’t time for much else.
Sometimes Kai Holnes draws; sometimes she writes. You’ll journey through the nebulous world of creative outlets and why maybe, just maybe, that journey is worth it.

but the thing is that the activity is

00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:07,910
important but so is the journey so

00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,220
you're gonna try different things and

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,590
some things as some of you may have

00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,480
known as you if you go bought back to

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,010
your youth when you were required to

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,090
take an art class and they required you

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,890
to draw and you're like I have this

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,950
great idea I want to draw this

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,090
magnificent you know wonderful image and

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,730
then you can only draw a stick figure

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,530
and the lines kind of crooked right if

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,369
there's there's a lot of learning curve

00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,869
to a lot of these things and there's

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,789
gonna be a lot of total failure and

00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:32,930
that's okay right there's there's

00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,780
sometimes you'll try something and

00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,820
you're like you know this works but it's

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,140
not something for me or there's some

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,370
things that you try and you're like you

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,200
know that was the worst disaster I've

00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,940
ever had in my life don't remind me of

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,260
it don't talk about it if you talk about

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,520
it we're gonna have to be friends like

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,840
we just can't be friends anymore and

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,239
then there's some things where you're

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,360
like okay you know this is not the best

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,540
for me but I can do it it's fine it it's

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,760
it work for now essentially and as I say

00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,129
for me for this journey there's a couple

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,690
of outcomes that happen so when I'll

00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,699
come is that you actually find something

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,250
this is something like alright I found

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,750
the hobby that works for me that gives

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,330
me what I'm looking for in terms of

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,890
improving those outside pieces and

00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,360
that's like kind of like the best

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,460
situation and I really appreciate for

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,890
those who people can actually find that

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,479
I think that's something that's a great

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,420
feeling to have and it's always

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,400
wonderful another situation is complete

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,020
failure you just you keep trying

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,119
something and you're like every single

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,070
time it's just it's just bombs you're

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,420
like I like this and I want to find

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,340
creative hobby but there's nothing that

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,100
I can actually find and in that case

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,720
it's really going back to getting used

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,909
to being comfortable in that failure and

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,710
trying and figuring out and what

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,079
actually you're missing and what's

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,549
something you're actually looking for

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,110
and then for some of you you may just

00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:53,060
find that creative hobbies are just

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,159
absolutely not your thing which is

00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,479
totally fine you know not everybody's

00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,520
gonna be interested in a creative hobby

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,189
not everybody who wants to be a creative

00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,960
hobby and sometimes doing things doesn't

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,909
actually have to have value just

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,070
actually taking the time to do something

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,379
else and try it is part of it's just as

00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,459
important as finding something that does

00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,459
