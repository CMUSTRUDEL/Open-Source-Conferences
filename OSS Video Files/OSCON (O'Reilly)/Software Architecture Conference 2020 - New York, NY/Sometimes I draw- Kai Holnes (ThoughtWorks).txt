Being a developer in today’s world means living and breathing technology whether it’s designing new systems or critiquing the design of your doctor’s scheduling web app (if they have one, that is). In the few moments in between, there isn’t time for much else.
Sometimes Kai Holnes draws; sometimes she writes. You’ll journey through the nebulous world of creative outlets and why maybe, just maybe, that journey is worth it.
