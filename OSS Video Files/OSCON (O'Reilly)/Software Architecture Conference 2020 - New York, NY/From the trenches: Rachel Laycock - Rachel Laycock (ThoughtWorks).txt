	00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:07,419
so what's your most recent or biggest

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,630
recent epiphany about architecture

00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:12,370
insight I think it's it's not even a

00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,250
recently it's just the one I always have

00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:18,580
is that it always ends up being around

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,470
people so I was really concerned about

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,300
going to this room of these architects

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,829
but you know when one side walks them

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,899
through you know my thinking because I

00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,399
was deep in it and I understood it they

00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,869
were on board they got it they asked a

00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,820
lot of good questions we went out for

00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:32,500
dinner afterwards we talked a lot they

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,809
were really supportive and you know I

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,039
was able to talk to their support in the

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,120
meetings with executives even though

00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,359
they still weren't happy with the

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,109
outcome the other things was just in

00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,730
situations where you know at one point

00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:49,749
in my career I actually did a lot of

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:51,850
phone call support and it's much easier

00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:53,140
to deal with really difficult problems

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,550
at 2:00 a.m. in the morning when you've

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,019
actually met some of the people you're

00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,489
talking to and in that organization I'm

00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,440
not kidding the infrastructure guys

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,570
actually sat in the dungeon I don't know

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,970
why but they like that in a room like

00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,940
that was deep in the organization with

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,430
no windows and nobody had ever talked to

00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,140
them and I was very inquisitive when I

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,730
was younger and I just kind of went down

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,170
and got to know them and spoke to them

00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,220
so that when I'm talking to them in the

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,180
middle of the night trying to solve

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,890
problems it was it's much easier but you

00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,440
know most because act X was always

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,410
changing now it's never like a static

00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,930
thing you're always dealing with with

00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,340
people and it's much easier to solve

00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,020
problems when you've actually got some

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,580
level of rapport with people and it's

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,800
easy to judge it's easy for me to look

00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,240
at that code generation madness and be

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,280
like what the hell are you guys thinking

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,690
but like just to sit back and understand

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,950
why they'd made that decision it was a

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,270
business decision like Martin was

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,650
talking about earlier they didn't

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,030
necessarily think it was the best

00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,590
architecture they'd ever done they were

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,490
like that's what we were tasked to do

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,290
that's what we did

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,240
so I think it's really important to like

00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,980
realize that it's that's people behind

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,450
these things and that there's a the

00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,450
