In the many architectural assessments Martin Fowler’s colleagues do in enterprises throughout the world, they commonly find one widely neglected architectural attribute. He doesn’t claim that its identity will shock you, but it does fuel his venting.

	00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,090
a common thing we run into these days is

00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,799
organizations asking us to divide up big

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,430
monolithic systems to help them divide

00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:15,680
them up into micro services now when we

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,310
come in and do that

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,680
fortunately quite a few of our

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,820
architects know that the best answer to

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,910
that question for a lot of organizations

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,740
is no you don't want to do that because

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,869
micro services are very fashionable at

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,570
the moment but they're all they're never

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,430
they're always the best solution the

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,409
monoliths have a lot of advantages in

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,140
handling them and particularly for

00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:39,179
organizations that are shall we say less

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,370
have less expertise in things like

00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,050
DevOps you really don't want to go down

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,729
that micro-service path at least not

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,639
first you need to get other stuff sorted

00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,249
out initially but assuming you'd are

00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,749
going down that path for a good reason

00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:55,199
how do you go down that how do you break

00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:57,479
up the monolith and a very crucial part

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,979
of this again is understanding how much

00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,739
value is going through different parts

00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,780
of the business and we had one client it

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,360
was an insurance company they had very

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,920
various lines of insurance you know car

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,799
insurance home insurance life insurance

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,789
whatever you can insure whatever sorts

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,409
of things these days and they wanted to

00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:18,270
figure out how they should break things

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,490
up they knew that breaking up by lines

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,049
of business made sense and that

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,450
apparently did make sense in that

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,640
circumstance so that's good but which

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,740
order should you do things well it's

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,420
very hard to figure out that without the

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,950
knowledge of how much money is actually

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,450
going through over different lines with

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,640
that understanding you can get a better

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,130
sense of okay which lines of business

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,840
carry the most money which ones are we

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,640
do we think are going to have the

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,409
greatest amount of change in the future

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,810
because obviously the things that are

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,119
changing more rapidly are the ones that

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,780
are gonna benefit most by being isolated

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,960
away and made easier to change you want

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,719
to move something early on that's not

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,310
too critical to the overall flow of the

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,780
organization because you're gonna mess

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,759
things up the first time everybody

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,319
messes everything up the first time so

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,350
you want to do something that's not

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,970
absolutely critical get that working and

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,050
then move quickly to the ones where

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,930
you're going to get the biggest return

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,569
on the value but all of these decisions

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,970
are based on the business value side of

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,220
things there will be technical concerns

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,470
as well as to how you break things up

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,250
but often they'll be secondary to the

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,250
