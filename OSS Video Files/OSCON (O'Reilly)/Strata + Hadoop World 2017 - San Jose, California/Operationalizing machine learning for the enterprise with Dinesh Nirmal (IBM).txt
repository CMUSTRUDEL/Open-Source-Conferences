hi this is Mike Henrickson from Strada

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,460
san Jose I'm here with Dinesh from IBM

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,379
didn't show you doing I'm doing great

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,660
wonderful so you gave a keynote this

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,880
morning I thought that was very nice you

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,679
talked about operationalizing machine

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,470
learning can you unpack that a little

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,199
bit for us sure so as part of the

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,480
keynote I also talked about the three

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,210
pillars or the three aspects of machine

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,039
learning so there's the data piece where

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,109
how do you bring in the data you cleanse

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,859
the data understand the data shape the

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,200
data and then the second pillar is the

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,510
development of the models were you know

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,489
once you have the data what algorithm to

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,219
use how do you score how do you train

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:46,710
right the last pillar is the deployment

00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,329
which is operationalizing that model

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,899
that you're built into your enterprise

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,110
and Mike I think that is the most

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,850
critical piece because think about it if

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,949
you're in their price rate most hundred

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,570
prices has been around for 40 50 60

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,579
years so they already have an

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,010
infrastructure that's built with

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,470
applications that's third-party that

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,290
they cannot touch software that was

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,049
written in the 50s and 60s and 70s that

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,150
is hard to change rules an engine that

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,299
already makes decision for you how do

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,159
you infuse ml into it how do you bring

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,040
that model that you've written in our or

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,140
Python into that infrastructure that is

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,939
the struggle that is the challenge that

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,570
enterprises face today so that's what I

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,150
meant by operationalizing your models

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,369
that you've written in a notebook will

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,930
stay in your notebook unless you can

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,790
bring that into that infrastructure so

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,100
is that in a way operationalize in

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,680
making it repeatable yeah right

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,600
operationalizing in the sense that

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,159
deploying it and let me expand on it so

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,680
when I say operationalizing it let me

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,670
give you three aspects or three examples

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,200
to it so let's say you deploy the model

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,000
what if the model becomes stale right

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,579
which will happen as the data changes

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,200
the scoring will go low so then you need

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,020
to look at it and say okay how do i

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,509
retrain that model without taking it

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,310
offline can you add a feedback loop

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,470
where by which the model is getting

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,350
real-time trained using real-time data

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,360
or let's take another example where

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,540
how do you make sure the model

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,620
management is in place so who deployed

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,020
the model right

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,530
where was it deployed was it in QA was

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,630
it in development when was it changed

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,390
who changed it all those the whole

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,300
lifecycle of the model management is so

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,390
critical then the third piece like I

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,160
said a lot of customers have legacy

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,160
applications like COBOL for example that

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,470
is sitting there now you have a Python

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,380
model that you've written or an R or a

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,840
scholar how do you marry those two right

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,530
those are the challenges now you want a

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,070
fast scoring engine that can take these

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:59,370
two together and have an API call to it

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,910
those are the real challenges our

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,220
customers are facing the middle piece of

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,960
the development of a model is getting

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,430
more and more commoditized right I mean

00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,860
you look at open-source tensorflow

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,480
you look at MX net I mean there's the

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,520
framework itself is going to get more

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,950
and more commoditized but how do you get

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,290
to that last pillar that is going to be

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,460
a job well and also you mentioned real

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,200
which is a really important word because

00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,780
it seems like a lot of data science is

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,690
is showing things in a competitive

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,770
competition style like is it real is it

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,020
making customers have better success is

00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,300
it giving them better value is it giving

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,640
them the results they want to see so how

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,770
do you get from the competition

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:53,030
mentality to real so good cushion so if

00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:56,360
you look at our data science competition

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,770
not a lot of times majority of the times

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,440
the data is given to you and it's

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,680
cleansed so you already have clean data

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,410
right then the second piece is that the

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,210
problem is defined what is that you're

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,430
competing for right this the scope is

00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:15,030
limited meaning you are told that here's

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:19,109
the problem and third piece is that you

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,710
know you're competing for a long loss of

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:24,690
point zero zero zero one which is very

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,940
you know from a decimal perspective but

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,220
how often Mike in real world your

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,620
problem is defined I mean you have to

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,270
figure out you know when the data comes

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,280
in is it clean

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,870
90% of the time the data is not going to

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,389
be clean you have to figure out our

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,160
values missing so I'll give you another

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,050
example so if you are we are working

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,990
with an insurance company where the data

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,020
comes in a lot of times the gender field

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,819
is missing how do you figure out if this

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:56,250
patient is a male or a female you have

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:58,259
to see if this patient has made a visit

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,199
to the doctor for a prostate exam he's a

00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,150
male if it's a gynecological exam it's a

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,699
female so if there is a lot of intuition

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,139
work goes into just to clean the data so

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,449
that's why I say competition is

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,310
competition it's good it's it's it's

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,289
really good for the industry it's really

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,780
good but the real-world problems is

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,180
totally different so how does a how does

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,120
a large enterprise get going with

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,190
putting this into practice in a real way

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,750
that is meaningful to their organization

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,300
how did how do they work with you guys

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,740
to actually make that happen right so we

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,840
have a lot of customers and the press

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,360
customers or dozens of enterprise

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,639
customers who are working with us and

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,320
the challenge is that look today they

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,110
have like I said the infrastructure

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,590
existing now we need to figure out where

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,270
do we infuse ml right how is machine

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,880
learning going to augment what they're

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,070
doing today it's not about replacement

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,669
it's about augmenting the technology

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,870
they have so can we make it more

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,580
predictive and once you make a

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,050
prediction can you optimize that

00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,610
prediction and once you make that

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,400
optimized prediction can you make a

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,050
decision on it right so when people talk

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,909
about machine learning it's about

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,270
prediction that's what it comes down to

00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:11,190
but there is a whole segment right after

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,229
prediction how do you optimize that

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,509
prediction right so let's say you are a

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,610
trucking company you have predicted that

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,380
this is the best round but is there an

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,150
optimized round and can you make a

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,669
decision based on that prediction that

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,460
you made so so so there is you know a

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:31,169
lot of different path segments you can

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:33,449
take and we as IBM can come in and

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,919
because we we know your enterprise space

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,439
better than anyone

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,909
and that I can watch to it right now we

00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,039
can come in and say okay here is your

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,770
architecture here's how things work how

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,740
do we infuse ml into it and it's not a

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,680
competition it's a journey so you need

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,870
to make sure that you have somebody who

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,909
is with you from step one to step in and

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,770
that that's not a that's not a one day

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,020
or two day what I totally hear the

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,830
journey and so in that journey what are

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,569
some of the common challenges that have

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,099
a customer kind of stubbed their toe a

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,979
little bit as they get going what are

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:14,099
what are some of the challenges you see

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:16,500
for large enterprises to actually get

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,590
business value out of using machine

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:25,770
learning right so the first challenge is

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:27,839
that there is a crazed rage about the

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,110
whole machine learning deep learning

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,969
space right now everybody wants to you

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,719
know say that they have machine learning

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:37,379
or deep learning

00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:39,779
now what as a customer you need to look

00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:43,620
at this first is a use case where does a

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:49,050
machine learning fit right how can i

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:52,110
optimize or or make more inroads in what

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:56,069
I am doing today and how do I make sure

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:58,439
I improve my business by doing machine

00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:01,259
learning so the first step is picking

00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,699
the use case and there are certain use

00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,110
cases where you could probably use her I

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,639
don't want to say simple but a logistic

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,250
regression for example or a linear

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,810
regression you don't have to go all the

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,479
way to the neural nets and all those

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:19,729
things right the benefit of going that

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:23,339
path is that one it's faster to train

00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:26,490
easier too easy to tune like if you have

00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:29,939
- right yeah and then there is a third

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,579
piece like that that's rarely talked

00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:35,399
about is explanation of that model and

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:37,890
I'll give you an example of that so

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,919
let's say you're a bank you have a long

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,750
processing model that you built

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,880
you have declined that long to me as a

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,610
consumer I'm going to come to you and

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,620
say why did you decline my loan you

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,560
should be able to explain to me the

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,800
reason behind that right in fairness

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,649
right so the more complicated the model

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,350
gets the layers of neural nets you have

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:05,380
the harder or maybe impossible for you

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,089
to explain it or if you the regulator

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,440
comes to you and say what happened you

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,079
should be able to say was it transparent

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,170
was it fair was their discriminatory

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,370
practices there was their bias there all

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,290
those things you should be able to

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,060
explain another example that we are

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,250
working with their insurance companies

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,410
that were there taking their patients

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,240
vital signs and then making it

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,149
prediction on when to bring in the

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,000
doctor one you better not get that model

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,500
Roth or anyone right and two if you get

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,870
it wrong you better be able to explain

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,420
it right so don't so when you say the

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,459
challenge is we have to come with the

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,290
customer and that's why I use the word

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:43,300
journey right it's a hand in hand

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,639
because they have the domain expertise

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,120
or we have the technical expertise how

00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,709
do you combine those two infuse ml into

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,060
the infrastructure that they have so

00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:57,630
it's not a easy task and IBM given the

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,740
fact that we have such a in-depth

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,389
expertise in the enterprise side of

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,850
things we can come and work with

00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:05,410
customers bring the deep data science

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,630
experience and work with them so humans

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,339
are always humans and domain expertise

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,959
are always going to be in that loop and

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:14,079
helping to guide the machine learning

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,500
definitely because because the you know

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:21,760
the humans has to be there and we always

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:24,760
say machine learning cognitive AI double

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,339
augment that prediction the

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,709
decision-making and the optimization of

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,110
businesses we don't think it's going to

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:35,199
replace it because you know if you take

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,290
some of the cases where something

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:40,269
happens you need a human being to be

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,590
able to intercept that and make the

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,950
right decision at that point

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,660
so Dinesh if you and I were to sit down

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,210
12 months from now sure here at the same

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,240
place and have a discussion what would

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:54,090
you like to say you guys that IBM have

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,550
done in that 12 months to improve

00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:00,250
machine learning for all of your your

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,279
partners and all of your ecosystem right

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,400
what would you like to see how so what I

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,650
would like to see happen is like I said

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,779
there's three aspects to machine

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,490
learning we're investing in all three

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,620
right so if you look at the data piece

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,470
we give you tools to clean the data we

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,750
give you tools to transform the data ETL

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,380
the data so that piece is very well

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:26,520
taken care of that the middle frame you

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,110
know I mean there's Watson bit deep

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,880
learning API is available where you can

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,410
do you know sentiment analysis you can

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,330
do speech recognition voice recognition

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,150
all those things but there's also other

00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,089
technologies you know that's there so we

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,970
are also investing in the middle piece

00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:46,450
the third piece is where we really need

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,880
to bring it together to home to make

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,589
sure that our customers will adopt it to

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,180
the existing infrastructure so if you

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,400
ask me 12 months what I would like to

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,950
see is that I would like to see one our

00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,210
investment starting to pay off

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,700
especially we are delivering data sense

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,830
experience which will encompass that all

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,720
three pillars and then seeing our

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,760
customers more and more adopting

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,250
replacing the rules engine or the rules

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,730
with more and more machine learning

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:16,990
which I really think as a customer will

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,780
make get better service for us and it

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,510
will also make us get better support

00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,430
from our customers or the businesses and

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,010
others and you learn as they learn and

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,290
it keeps improving oh yeah but because

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,360
I'll give you you know an example so

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,870
let's say you're an airline customer you

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,480
want your airline to learn about you as

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,490
the customer to understand your

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,529
preferences you know understand your

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,720
likes and dislikes so they can serve you

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:46,330
better and that's exactly what machine

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,170
learning will do it will learn about you

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,430
Mike

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:53,530
as an customer to understand what what

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,070
do you like when you get into that

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,660
Airport

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,730
what are the things what are the

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,220
preferences what are the likes that Mike

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,140
has so we can serve him better and I

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,360
think so that's a great you know great

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,430
next 12 months 24 months we are looking

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,900
at where they are not only learning

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:12,940
about us as customers but about serving

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,260
as better excellent Dinesh we look

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,860
forward to that journey with you well

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,860
thank you so much

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,350
