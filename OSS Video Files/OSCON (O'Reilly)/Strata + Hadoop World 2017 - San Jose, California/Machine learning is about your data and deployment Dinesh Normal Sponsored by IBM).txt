	00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:07,009
good morning everyone and thanks Desiree

00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:09,230
that was a great presentation and I'm

00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,880
going to cover how not to get into an

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,219
enterprise disaster with machine

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,650
learning so that's going to be my topic

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,680
over the next five minutes or so what I

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,590
want to do is talk to you about what we

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,090
have learned working with dozens of

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,090
enterprise customers on machine learning

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,250
on the lessons that we have learned so

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,410
we are in the heart of Silicon Valley

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,149
and I'm not going to get into the

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,920
mechanics of machine learning but when I

00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:37,460
look at machine learning there are three

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,890
DS to it one is data how do you make

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,289
sure that the data you have you

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,870
understand the data you cleanse the data

00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:47,210
you transform the data some once you

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,510
have done that how do you do the

00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,269
development of the models so you have to

00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,100
pick the right algorithm you have to

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:58,010
train the model and then you have to

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,429
score the model right and then the third

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,550
piece which is I think the most critical

00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:06,979
piece is deployment and especially with

00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,979
the enterprise customers it's so

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:12,880
critical that you bring the notebook

00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:14,990
that you have created into an

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,869
infrastructure that has been around for

00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:21,740
decades and that brings to my first

00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:24,710
point which is operationalizing mo goes

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,560
beyond data science competitions the

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:31,119
reason I say it is because in the data

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,560
science competition the data is clean

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,689
the problem the scope is defined and

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,409
then you're competing for a large loss

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:45,700
of point zero zero zero zero one but in

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:49,600
the real world it's different so

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,159
majority of enterprise customers have

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,270
applications that was written in the 70s

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,750
or 60s they have rules-based engines

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:02,240
that make decision for them today they

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,850
also have third party applications that

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,250
you cannot change so the question is

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,410
like how do you infuse ml machine

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,630
learning into that into that existing

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,610
infrastructure let me give you a couple

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,270
of examples let's say you deploy a model

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,910
it becomes stale

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,280
how do you make sure you retrain that

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,410
model without taking it offline how do

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,210
you put a feedback loop in there so that

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,030
the model is getting retrained using

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,190
real-time data another example how do

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,560
you do model management what version of

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,140
the model was deployed where was it in

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,130
QA was it in development was it in

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,870
protection how do you make sure that the

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,200
security the governance layer

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,120
overarching this is there and the last

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,340
piece is that you know let's say you

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,760
have a COBOL application that exists

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,070
that was written in the 70s or 80s now

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,540
you have developed an AR model that you

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,700
want to deploy how do you marry those

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,000
two these are the kind of challenges

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,880
that our enterprise customers face and

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,060
that's why I've brought up this point

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:09,030
the next one is these are the lessons we

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,820
have learned right so sometimes the 50

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,030
cent algorithm works just as well as a

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:20,850
fi dollar algorithm what do I mean by

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,140
that so we love deep learning ok deep

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,030
learning is in our DNA

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,110
Watson is built all around deep learning

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,090
but my point is classic ml is not dead

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,220
meaning on the left hand side we have

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:37,280
the you know support vector machine and

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:40,500
the right hand side is a is a neural net

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,200
sometimes and logistic regression might

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,560
do the trick

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,900
why do I say that it's faster to train

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,780
if you are using hyper parameters you

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,060
know it's easier to tune and the third

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,550
point which is also a critical point for

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,610
our enterprise customers which brings me

00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:04,080
to the next one which is the algorithm

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,830
told me so in going to work I'll give

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,130
you an example

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,600
let's say you're a financial bank and

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,890
this is a real you know we are working

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:18,030
with customers and you created a model

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:21,330
that there's loan processing you come to

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,910
us for a loan and we deny the loan you

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:28,280
have to explain to that consumer why you

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:31,250
denied that loan was there bias involved

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,340
was there discrimination was it fair was

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,040
it transparent a regulator might ask

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,630
these questions how do you explain that

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,820
or let's say in another one we are

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,530
working with is a hospital chain where

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,290
they are taking a patient's vital signs

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,560
and making a decision or a prediction

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,300
when to call in the doctor first of all

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,970
that model better not go wrong or

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,130
predict wrong second if a product's

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,919
wrong you better be able to explain why

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:01,310
that prediction went wrong so it's so

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,230
critical that model explanation or model

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,020
interpretation especially for enterprise

00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,110
customers I mean I just put you know is

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,640
summarized given the five minutes

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,650
summarizing the three key points that I

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,870
thought are important as we are working

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,760
with dozens of enterprise customers and

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,070
I have only touched the tip of the

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,340
iceberg folks what I want to do is like

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,020
I want to invite you guys to come and

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,370
engage with us because we have been

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,950
working with these customers we are

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,040
learning a lot engage with us in two

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,370
ways right one go to ibm.com data

00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,810
science where we have all the tools

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,280
especially from a feedback loop whether

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,560
it's monitoring whether it's management

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,750
whether it's a canvas where you want to

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,610
go visualize visualize and build models

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,520
we have all those things using our data

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,530
science experience or come and work with

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,840
us we have a machine learning hub right

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,550
here in the Silicon Valley come and work

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,570
with us we have trained data scientist

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,240
who has been working with enterprise

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,190
customers we are available at both one

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,410
three one five so come and talk to us

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,710
with that hope you enjoyed the five

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,089
minutes thank you so much

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,089
[Applause]

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,050
