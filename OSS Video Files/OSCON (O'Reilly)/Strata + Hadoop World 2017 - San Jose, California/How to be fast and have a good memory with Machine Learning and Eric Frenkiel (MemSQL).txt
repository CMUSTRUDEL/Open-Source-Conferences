hi this is my conviction from strata

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,040
hadoop world in San Jose I'm here with

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,509
Eric link you'll Eric how you doing

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,639
great leg thanks for having me you're

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,429
with them sequel yep and you guys have

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,870
gone from like a small company in a

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,480
matter of short period of time to a

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,980
large player in this industry can you

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,529
talk a little bit about that journey

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,869
well it actually starts roughly with

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,359
strata we were one of the entrance in

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,960
the syrup showcase in 2013 at strada I

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,029
do Portland San Jose we won first place

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,130
to take the the trophy as it were and

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,410
that was actually I get a sign of good

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,020
things to come because that feed us up

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,190
for more investment and at this point

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,440
we've raised nearly a hundred million

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,730
dollars from zero on dcs it's really

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,829
positioned the Consulate's to innovate

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,260
and that we've done in the real time

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,640
component of big data so for us to be

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,079
working with one of these great

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,820
companies pushing the bounds of real

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,079
time it's because we've always focused

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,410
there since really when we started the

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,610
company in 2011 so a slow start to say

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,260
the least you have to take time to build

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,090
a great database software so bye 2013 we

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,309
had built the core engine and since then

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,960
it's been doubling and quadra playing

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,580
pretty much every year and so now you're

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,439
pretty active in machine learning you're

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,240
not you're building another there's

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,400
another platform where he said part of

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,619
the platform the thing with real-time is

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,560
that it actually is very relevant for

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,590
machines humans think and move very

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,180
slowly and machines being able to

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,920
parallel eyes a good part of the

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,920
workload will benefit from a lot of main

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,509
memory processing so our exploration of

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,320
work and machine learning has really

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:37,159
benefited that type of use case around

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,030
sat in just I OT image recognition

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,579
things like that that are really

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,290
benefiting from a very close synergy

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,350
between a main memory component with mem

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,090
sequels roast or as well as a open first

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,890
premier bank tensorflow which is very

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,049
helpful to basically teach the system

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,970
how to learn over time so machine

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,950
learning tied to a aight guys i mean

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,600
their their smallness with each other is

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,399
this a current fad or is this something

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,170
that's going to move the industry

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,380
forward pretty quickly I think it's been

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,119
moved forward very quickly effectively

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,400
machine learning must have a state you

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,020
have to have a notion of a memory for

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,880
the machine

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,070
and a data store is what you need to do

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,690
that of course it turns out that things

00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,010
like Hadoop which with a oriented are

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,020
not well designed for that they were

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,180
never intended for it so you see a lot

00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,500
more development with spark let's say

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,690
that its main member oriented but

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,120
doesn't upstate spark as a transient

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,980
framework it's just there we put all our

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,930
efforts making sure that you can be fast

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,760
and have a good memory so we talked

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,900
about machine learning we've done a lot

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,980
of integration with tensorflow we've

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,510
actually put a lot of things into the

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,850
systems make it easy to actually train a

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,230
model with them sequel we've done a lot

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,340
of great work with thorne which is a

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,230
non-profit focused on eradicated

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,340
exploitation of children on the internet

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:54,440
more than a hundred thousand ads are

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,060
posted a day on public web and thorn is

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,820
actually using them sequel various other

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,190
technologies to be able to consume that

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,170
new data and then match it against an

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,390
existing repository of missing children

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,010
and with the improvements we've made

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,660
into our software we've been able to

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,910
help Thor and compress law enforcement

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,350
searches for month down two days and

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,900
that's already found two thousand

00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:18,680
children and 2016 alone so you said you

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,410
could make someone fast and with good

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,820
memory certainly I wish that was good

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,700
like I write everything down because I

00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,900
the same thing for me so that sounds

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,360
like you're building kind of this

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,400
real-time data pipeline is that what you

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,630
guys are kind of putting in play hi

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,750
plays are definitely a part of it i

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,450
think as more data is generated across

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,520
any given enterprise or application

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,400
being able to consume that data easily

00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,560
is important the notion of batch loading

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,980
for example a csv file into an engine is

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,750
really really old hat Kafka for example

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,640
which is not the apache foundation is

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,070
perfect for this type of youth case it's

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,390
a message queue we can broadcast

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,150
anything from Kafka to multiple

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,040
endpoints and in particular we actually

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,860
decided to very closely align with that

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,140
by introducing create pipeline into the

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,310
mem sequel engine so the same way you'd

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,050
create a table you can now create a

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,850
pipeline in the mem single database and

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,190
then that pipeline is attached to a

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,630
table now that data is streaming through

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,850
automatically it gets saved

00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,010
automatically in the table and the cool

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,799
thing is it has exactly one semantics

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,080
out of the box pipelines can disconnect

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,340
they can go down so when you resume it

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
then people track the off

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,790
and that means that we can track that's

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,560
the last moment of time before that

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,419
connection was severed and then bring

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,470
the business back up to exactly once

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,910
guarantees of data certain systems that

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,040
are not able to do that are only able to

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,260
do inserts because members people can do

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,300
upstarts or in the variation of an

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,520
insert plus update you can actually

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,620
achieve live duplication and exactly one

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,940
semantics is the end result so does the

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,940
company then have to manage multiple

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,680
pipelines or their github one or a Vespa

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,150
today orchestrating them or you can

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,650
actually have multiple pipelines hitting

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,200
different tables so you might have a

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,220
pipeline for your your text messages you

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,930
might have a pipeline for your Twitter

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,169
feeds and then you can interpolate that

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,310
by doing a basic joint on the tables

00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:09,470
pipelines are just a way to make big

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,419
data easier the reason why I'm Kafka is

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,530
proliferating this ecosystem is because

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,530
it's a very important way of actually

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,120
shuttling data across an enterprise for

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,500
a real-time data warehouse which is what

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,030
we build you want to have made of

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,520
connectivity so it's easy to interact

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,530
with it easy to consume it and function

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,940
they actually later on able to return

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,229
that data back into the cost of feet so

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,000
it can be shared with other parts of the

00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:32,030
organization so do you guys work mostly

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,310
in in on-premise with your partners or

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,830
you do have a cloud solution as well or

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,150
what we've seen a big shift most of our

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,950
customers to date about two-thirds were

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,169
on Prem a third are already on the cloud

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,970
and we're very excited to be in private

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,220
limited release with our cloud service

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,690
that's running today we have customers

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,849
in production with it and I would love

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,260
to give you more detail but it's already

00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,090
something that is actively on our mind

00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,979
the ability to actually have a managed

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,870
service makes it easy for companies to

00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,400
engage with the software no more DBA is

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,440
not having to worry about administration

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,150
and if you look at things like red shift

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,539
which is a traditional data warehouse

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,130
capability that's very exciting more

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,900
broadly though when we talk about cloud

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,960
it's really about maintaining API

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,430
neutrality for customers that are using

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,889
CSPs there's I'm in my view an ideal

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,539
equilibrium of two cloud strategy for a

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,130
given company where you want to have

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,380
something like Amazon and Google or

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,180
Amazon and Azure so that you always

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,139
ensure you a pricing leverage to make

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,180
sure you're getting the best price and

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,380
get a balancing as well maybe that's it

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,320
when half of the internet went down

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,880
because of Amazon's issues if a dual

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,190
cloud strategy would have ensured that

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,830
business would have stayed up yeah so if

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,900
you and I were to sit down

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,150
12 months from now what would you like

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,910
to say mm sequel has accomplished in

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,040
those 12 months and uh huh what would

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,170
you like to say the industry is now

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,420
accomplishing better than we have been I

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,460
think in 12 months time it really is

00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,840
going to be focusing on closer and

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,030
tighter integration with tensorflow more

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,180
broadly the work we've done with thorn

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,160
is very exciting but it was ultimately

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,690
going to be more broadly shared by

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,370
putting more of that capability in the

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,150
engine so image recognition is something

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,280
that is very exciting it's not just for

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,840
documents or it mapping there's so many

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,400
different use cases with video for

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,290
example that would benefit from this and

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,030
for the industry as well I think it's

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,070
going to be more flexibility in all

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,770
truth for customers that are engaged

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,050
with big data I think tying yourself

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,380
into any given cloud is a recipe for

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,360
disaster really the whole notion of

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,460
being locked into a given cloud is why

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,230
you want a dual cloud strategy at a

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,540
minimum so new years time I i would

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,800
think that more Big Data technology

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,780
should be available in multiple clouds

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,060
and that's going to make it easier to

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,830
ensure that any given customer can get

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,190
the best price on their given cloud

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,560
solution provider and one last question

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,960
sure to go for it so in the world we

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,870
live in if you could apply data to

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,630
anything to improve this world what

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,660
would it be for you I mean a a year ago

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,190
I gave an answer I think focused more on

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,930
water and the ability to provide that to

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,570
leave in which the developing world

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,710
resource allocation the work we've done

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,480
with for now the last eight months

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:16,150
really epitomizes my personal value of

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,040
what we can offer it's meaningful to me

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,170
in a significant way because it's

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,820
actually haunting children that can be

00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,030
reunited with their families I'm

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,910
hard-pressed to think of a better way to

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,320
help your eyes and it than that and I'm

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,890
thankful we don't to do that with thorns

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,780
a partnership but if I had to look back

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,090
I would say certainly energy continues

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,530
to be an area focus I think we're

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,150
finally seeing a lot of development with

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,520
solar where we're going to see a lot

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,550
more synergy between solar and batteries

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,840
so willingly I hope that more big data

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,400
companies can actually engage in make

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,830
that a reality because that functionally

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,750
is an IOT use case

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,000
you have an ability to actually ensure

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,180
that you have a smart grid on your power

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,530
grid now it's not just burning coal at a

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,440
fixed volume you should be able to

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:04,440
tailor that how households are actually

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,550
running so for me looking beyond the

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,380
thorn use case it would be something

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,030
more on utilities and how we can help

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,680
them be more efficient save the

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,030
environment effectively excellent Eric

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,080
that sounds great thank you so much

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,080
thank you out of me

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,380
