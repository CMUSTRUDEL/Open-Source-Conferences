hi this is Mike Henrickson from strata

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,029
hadoop world in san jose i'm here with

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,429
william or son william how you doing

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,099
good okay thank you so you're with data

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,410
science yes you're not talking about

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,730
your data science is accompanied you

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,850
guys playing a little bit about what you

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,039
guys do absolutely so the company is

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,470
called data science we have data science

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,050
to a calm is the homepage and we have a

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,420
platform for data scientists so it gives

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,820
them the tools that they prefer to use

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,980
with infrastructure and a workflow

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,079
around it so it's basically a new way

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,420
for data scientists to do the work that

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,100
they need to do you have a platform so

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,860
there's a lot to a platform what

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,899
actually do you provide your partners as

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,289
part of your platform yeah yes so we

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,960
provide a full set of the open source

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,539
tools that teams like to use so things

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,850
like r and python and scala are all

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,329
available there we help manage things

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,440
like dependencies and version control

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,059
what teams can do is they can go in

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,890
there collaborate with other data

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,979
sciences collaborate with business teams

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,409
engineering develop their code develop a

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,780
model and then push that model into

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,420
production so we provide that full

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,860
end-to-end workflow around that we

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,450
provide the tools that they need and

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,509
then we back that up with infrastructure

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,850
and and so you provide end in all the

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,780
way down from like IOT devices in the

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:28,049
world all the way up to visualizing and

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:30,869
analytics it the viewing level yes yes

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,400
so you know I OT is a frequent use case

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,110
because there's a lot of data and it's

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,170
sometimes challenging the work with so

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,960
sonos to the customer they use the

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,360
platform to process all their IOT data

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,790
connect it into their email and customer

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,770
service systems so that's one flow that

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,479
we typically see and then the end

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,130
product for some data science teams is I

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,780
need to produce an output that looks

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,729
something like a dashboard so they can

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,100
you know build those as our shiny apps

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,570
or integrated with tableau and then

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,340
their model is feeding those systems

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,899
instead of maybe going into another

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,240
machine it's actually surfaced in a

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,180
report so as a platform where you plug

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,539
and play you can I as a business person

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,030
could choose which pieces of your

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,770
platform I want to assemble yeah it's

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,420
very configurable

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,570
so as we've been talking to larger

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,370
enterprise companies we're finding that

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,800
nobody's just on a single system today

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,230
meaning that even if they're using a

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,420
cloud provider that's where some data is

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,800
but there's often you know dozens of

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,630
other systems they might need to work

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,760
with even if there's one team that

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,650
prefers a certain tool or coding

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,880
language there's other teams that prefer

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,440
other things so one of our big points in

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,540
the platform is just to make it flexible

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,580
so we want it to be an easy integration

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,930
we don't want people to have to swap out

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,180
the tools that they're comfortable if

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,140
using we want them to use the tools in

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,120
the infrastructure that they're

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,570
comfortable with but what we want to put

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,970
around that is security we want to put a

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,830
collaboration workflow notifications all

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,540
around that so that there's better

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,780
exposure into the data science work

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,820
what's happening and you cover both

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,890
on-premise cloud and hybrid that's right

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,480
out that's all three that's right yes as

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,730
we as we brought out the solution the

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,950
market we found that the bulk of

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,040
customers for their data science work

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,330
actually on Prem and you know someone

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,560
that's been a big data for a long time

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,570
it's a little bit like well you should

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,070
be on the club but i think that the

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,990
nature of data science work is it's

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,940
always touching the most sensitive data

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,850
at the organization so it's PII data

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,800
it's the RM data it's you know internal

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,630
derived a related data right highly

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,510
regulated data in some industries and

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,730
that needs to stay under lock and key so

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,920
what we did is we built a single

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,170
instance infrastructure and it can be

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,660
deployed on Prem for customers so their

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,860
IT teams can manage security and all the

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,510
things that they need to do on their

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,450
side so what do you thinks is the

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,080
biggest value that a platform like this

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,640
would offer someone who's trying to

00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,650
grapple with getting their data under

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,660
control and making good business

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,340
decisions with it yeah we think is the

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,820
biggest barrier for making that happen

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,320
yeah yeah there's a lot of barriers I'd

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,360
say that the biggest one that we're

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,370
seeing at large organizations where they

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,489
have hundreds of data scientists is

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,980
really about getting exposure for the

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,770
team's work in a way that it can be

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,620
repeated and it can be sort of elevated

00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,450
within the organization I think the big

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,330
change that we've seen is that data

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,039
science teams are shifted from being

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,349
back-office function to being front

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,759
office so they're in the cmo's

00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:34,699
organization there in the sales

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,530
organization finance engineering product

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,680
their data scientists everywhere within

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,419
these teams and now the kind of next

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,490
step for them is you know how do I work

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:45,830
with all of these other constituents and

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,750
other divisions how do i show my

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,389
business stakeholders that my work is

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,370
delivering value and then for them how

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,590
do I make it secure how do I make it

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,939
repeatable and how does it scale so

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,099
those are the things that we solve for

00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,659
so I like the repeatable part so the

00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:02,210
repeatable is that like building a

00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:04,639
pipeline or so your platform helps

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,830
people build their pipeline better or

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,419
yeah little bit more repeatable yeah so

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,219
what we found is a lot of teams what

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,860
happens is they they get all the way to

00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:15,110
the point where they've selected a model

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,909
they know what they want to do and then

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,039
there's this hand off that happens with

00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:21,199
engineering and that's a major breaking

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,690
point for a lot of data science teams so

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,759
what that usually translates into is the

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,409
data sciences hands over a model written

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,479
a certain way and then the engineering

00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,529
team completely rewrite sit in a

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,599
language that they're comfortable with

00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:34,009
and then you're looking back on it and

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,870
you're sort of six months down the line

00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,360
and you have to start all over again so

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,120
what we did is we closed that gap so

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,740
models can be deployed behind an API so

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,440
it's almost like an internal market

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,120
place of models gets generated so the

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,219
engineering teams can use those api's

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,379
they can know that they're up and

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,810
running they can test them and we help

00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:56,080
with some of that translation from

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,909
things like Python and are in two

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,440
languages like Java that engineers are

00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,889
more comfortable with are there any

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,469
industries that you see better adapting

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:08,889
to the new data world and are there any

00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:11,930
industries that are lagging the Jesse

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,610
absolutely yeah it's a the the sort of

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,919
companies that we're seeing at the

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,750
forefront are people that are made of

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,050
digital obviously so people that might

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,330
be gaming companies mobile app gaming

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,129
companies people that are coming more

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,599
from like a telecommunications and

00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,520
communications background where they're

00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,289
comfortable working with these large

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,569
data streams financial services

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,939
insurance is another

00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:36,580
I'd say areas that we're seeing sort of

00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:38,080
slower development media companies would

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,909
be an example of that where they're sort

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,249
of dipping their toes in it but quite

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:44,379
kind of quite built out the teams yet to

00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:46,209
support what they need retail would be

00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,770
another example where you know

00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:49,719
historically a lot of retailers is

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,909
outsourced the function or relied on a

00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:53,830
third party to do it for them they're

00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,059
slowly starting to bring it in house

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,740
because they're you know having to

00:06:55,059 --> 00:07:00,459
compete with people like Amazon that are

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,770
very focused all right yeah so William

00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,289
if you and I sat down 12 months from now

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,779
and we have the same conversation next

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:11,559
year what would you like to say changes

00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:14,169
for data science and for you guys yeah

00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:16,330
data science yeah just and what dragon

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:19,629
say has changed in the data science

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,099
world yeah yeah so as a company a big

00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,099
part of what we're focused on is not

00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:26,949
just the platform but also building a

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,869
community so we're releasing an open

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,059
source project here at the event and

00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:32,499
we're building out some new community

00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:34,599
features on our website to really

00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:36,129
encourage data scientists to share the

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,229
work that they're doing collaborate with

00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,269
other partners hopefully in a year from

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,399
now you'll see that community take

00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:44,709
foothold and we've been partnering with

00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,029
o'reilly on that as well so i think from

00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,559
our perspective we'd like to see the

00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,050
community build out and we want to

00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:51,909
support that and get behind that for the

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,259
company itself from the product I think

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:56,529
a lot of what we're seeing from

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,059
customers is that the walls are sort of

00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:01,329
breaking down between these different

00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:03,490
divisions and organizations so I think a

00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:05,019
real success for us would be you know

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,449
much broader adoption of the platform

00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:09,249
within these organizations and elevating

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,110
the work that data scientists are doing

00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,389
so that you know they have a seat at the

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,849
table with the CEO and CMO instead of

00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,899
sort of being an afterthought when stuff

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,789
doesn't work out the way it should

00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:22,019
excellent wouldn't we look for that

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,019
conversation thank you very much

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,730
