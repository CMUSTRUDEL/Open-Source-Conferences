hi this is mike henderson estrada hadoop

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,000
world in san jose i'm here with Jack

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,460
Morris Jack how you doing good so how

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,120
are things in that far excellent we're

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,549
growing really really quickly a lot of

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,800
interest across a broad section of

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,020
companies and industries and it's really

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,760
exciting to see how customers are really

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,710
adopting and doing a lot with the

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,490
platform and you're noodling on the edge

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,920
now yeah we announced map our edge just

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,820
now that yesterday and CAD there's a

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,880
demo on stage the keynote so wouldn't CH

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,040
bring two people well it's you know if

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:44,219
you look at you know the whole kind of

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,620
Internet as we know it IOT is changing

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,230
that dramatically right fifty billion

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,829
devices in the next few years coming

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,870
online each generating content so Ted

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,120
had a whole talk Ted Dunning how to talk

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,149
on turning the internet upside down and

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,000
what that means and increasingly it's

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,790
about collecting data locally collecting

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,080
data at the edge being as close to it as

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,909
possible doing some calculations

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,070
aggregations reducing that set there's

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,750
many examples where you just don't have

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,479
the bandwidth and constant connectivity

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,299
to upload that into a central location

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,439
so having an edge process there to

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,829
coordinate the the data and then collect

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,159
it centrally so that you get the benefit

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,890
of seeing all of the the edge

00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,229
information the edge locations and then

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,210
learning globally and then injecting

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,030
that intelligence back to the a local

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,680
right so there's some intelligence can

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,100
be done locally so that you can do low

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,520
latency or not beholdin to some you know

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,579
centralized connection but you benefit

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,369
from the experience on a global basis or

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,130
a much broader geographic basis so you

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,740
don't have to encounter every issue or

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,899
event or air at the edge you can benefit

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,759
what helping what happened in another

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,149
location so this plugs into the map our

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,760
platform yeah it's actually the way we

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,130
have deployed this is map our edge can

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,590
run a very small foot

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,240
like the Intel Nuck next unit of

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,760
computing which are very small form

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,060
factor but it's part of the entire

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,250
fabric so you can manage it centrally as

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,770
well as as locally so you've got some

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,780
flexibility there the whole data

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,460
protection and security is part of the

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,210
same fabric the whole global namespace

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,970
so you can really do a lot of remote

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,450
management on these edge devices without

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,830
having to touch every unit so that that

00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,480
will help down the road when we're doing

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,310
more smart cities other than just

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,410
Singapore it's really across the board

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,520
so it's smart city needs it's its

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,660
healthcare and Hospital its oil and gas

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,830
you know all of these have different

00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:01,730
edge devices that are part of a bigger

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:05,360
hole yeah so where do you think that the

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:08,270
state of data is now I mean I are we are

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,010
we changing at all or we're repeating

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,090
the same stories it seems like the last

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,660
few years have we have we progressed far

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:22,610
enough along from your own purse I think

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:25,550
that kind of cyclical issue is is kind

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,770
of a rinse and repeat process and in

00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,750
some cases so you know originally the

00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,730
promise of big data was like we've got

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,530
these individual silos you know that a

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,410
special purpose and we need to bring the

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,120
data together into a broader platform

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,670
whether you call it a lake or a hub or

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,650
whatever and then bring the processing

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:47,510
to it but then because of some design or

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,850
architectural issues you see that well

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,440
yeah that cluster is for this type of

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,760
processing that if you want to do no

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,800
sequel process you know that's another

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,750
cluster and if you want to do streaming

00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,440
which is important with it deploy this

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,850
cluster and so pretty soon we've got

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,670
silos with just different names on them

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,770
complexity complexities though we think

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,140
when it comes to to full digital

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,990
transformation that there there's three

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,530
basic keys and one is convergence of the

00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:18,560
data so that you get data in in one kind

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,450
of logical management plane that can be

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,110
distributed from the edge to the cloud

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,460
to on-premise that you can incorporate

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,850
streams into that fabric that's kind of

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,830
an integrated p

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,420
so to publish and subscribe and that can

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,570
drive real-time events and it's very

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,790
complex Association and coordination of

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,940
events and the third is just driving

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,020
agility from the developer to the

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,880
administrator to DevOps to the

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,450
infrastructure whether that's containers

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,280
or clouds or micro services so that's

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,520
been the focus of map bar is how do we

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,500
think much bigger about Big Data how do

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,930
we get the platform and infrastructure

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,460
in place to really raise the silk basal

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,950
level big data is one part of the

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,900
digital transformation but it's a key

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,900
part because it's both informing where

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,840
you go and it's helping you be informed

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,420
of how you're doing as you're going so

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,910
how do how do we get that that that part

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,830
to rinse repeat because from from what

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,150
we're seeing is a lot of people are

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,610
talking about digital transformation

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,210
yeah I don't think they understand how

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,700
important data is as as far as the

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,110
change agent a lot of people you hear

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,540
DevOps and you hear they want to be a

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,390
lean organization here and they want to

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,770
continuously deploy you hear those yeah

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:36,600
over and over but that data layer is

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,640
probably the secret sauce that gets them

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,070
there it's definitely the fuel right

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,830
it's the you know the engine behind

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,630
digital transformation is how do you

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,600
take advantage of multiple data sources

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,690
and how do you understand the context

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,550
and and take the appropriate action so

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,550
it's the intelligence interacting with

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,810
that data that's important and whether

00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,520
you're looking at transforming the

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,590
customer experience or whether you're

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,930
your focus more on the operational

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,960
excellence and driving down cost and

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,840
efficiency it requires this ability to

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,440
really leverage leverage data

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,760
effectively and you know that's that's

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,890
really our our focus of the converged

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,790
platform is to make that really

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,380
accessible and easy for for companies so

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,860
today's business leaders really need to

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,630
harness the data first yeah and it's not

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,130
a you know here's the existing

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,170
architecture and now we're going to

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,120
riorca tect and have this digital

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,030
transformation architecture the real key

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,990
is you've got to take these very

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,420
tactical

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,930
steps that are part of the journey and

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,730
so you know think of how do I leverage

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,380
the existing infrastructure today to

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,260
drive down costs and drive innovation

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,630
and we think it's supporting industry

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,060
standards supporting legacy applications

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,580
really wrapping those and injecting

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,790
intelligence is is the way to do that so

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,800
it puts a lot more focus on what's the

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,260
underlying architecture to make that

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,970
happen so it's not it's relatively

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,560
simple to say well we're changing

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,240
everything we have this new architecture

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,230
and this new API and this new way of

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,760
doing things it's it's been hard to

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,890
integrate that into the existing

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,340
environment and if you can support both

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,380
legacy and modern applications at once

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,320
now the sudden you can incrementally

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,340
pursue that it drives higher ROI faster

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,050
adoption and and ultimately agility so

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,830
one of the darlings in the last couple

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:40,680
years has been AI do you see AI

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,720
fundamentally changing businesses in the

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,970
world basically yeah I think I think the

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:53,190
I think the best way to think about AI

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:56,940
and machine learning is to to move from

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:59,220
it's a model and there's a curator a

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,800
data scientist of that model that's

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,890
there to kind of provide insight and

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,260
think more about a business process and

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,740
how you inject intelligence into that

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:15,660
business so it's not about the report or

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,820
the big vision or a prediction it's more

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:22,950
about impacting business as it happens

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:26,220
making small adjustments so the the more

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,730
data you can bring to bear the more

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,050
direct the algorithm you know the

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,240
intelligence that you can combine and

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,790
that's a earning that we've seen you

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,500
know come from from google terms of the

00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,020
white papers that they've written and

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,390
some of the work that the ted dying or

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,330
chief application architect has has done

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,600
with you know kind of the leading edge

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,380
of data science for commercial adoption

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,800
but humans are still in that Luke

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,360
the scientists are so now before someone

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,310
feeding the intelligence right the

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,990
important part there is the data

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,350
exploration to figure out you know

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,770
what's possible the the ability to test

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:09,070
and and and use different models in

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:12,220
place right but it's increasingly about

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,590
what is the automated adjustment not the

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,780
insight that you know some business

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,420
analyst has and then walks down the hall

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,750
to try to implement that so it's the

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:26,200
automated part yep yep so how long do

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,420
you think we are away from a society

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,420
that we're having self-driving cars

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,660
we're having decisions made for us on a

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,220
daily basis are we like when we were

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,710
little our parents thought going to the

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:43,960
moon was impossible and then we saw it

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:46,360
happen it's happening today and I think

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,680
the adoption is going to happen much

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,110
much faster than than you project you

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,090
know self-driving car I think they it's

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,090
not a technology issue it's more of a

00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:01,050
regulation cultural issue in terms of

00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,460
the adoption you know already seeing

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,760
we're already seeing kind of impacts in

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,580
terms of helping improve safety through

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,880
some of the technologies there and held

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,770
earlier becomes preventative rather than

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,710
insurance based or into thinking a lot

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,100
happen there really exciting stuff in

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:26,170
terms of you know incorporating

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:28,270
underlying genomics information patient

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:33,210
lifestyle information and then

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:36,460
fine-tuning the drug delivery and and

00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:40,750
you know in treatment to improve improve

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:44,160
outcomes and reduce costs so if we look

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,810
at the any business there either

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,250
changing because their digital

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,120
transformation or they're going to be

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,950
disrupted what do you think what

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,630
disruption still needs to happen in the

00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:00,070
data world that we're not seeing right

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:02,990
now is there something really ripe for

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:09,080
disruption to change the way we as

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:14,240
humans live and do things so probably

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:20,360
the biggest disruption is what we

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,490
consider an application you know

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,740
starting with the application that then

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,380
dictates how the data must be organized

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,890
and stored is kind of how we used to do

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,200
things and I think now looking at what's

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,100
the date of fabric what's the data

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:41,200
platform that I can easily bring a

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:46,220
series of agile processes to to improve

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,930
the the top line activities to deliver

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,900
my my product or service more

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,770
efficiently and to mitigate risk so

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,529
there's a there's a little bit of a of

00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:00,140
an adjustment right because the the

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,300
people that are typically the most

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,640
familiar with data coming from the data

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,860
warehouse or data science world have

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,350
been trained over the years that the way

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,600
to succeed is to basically understand

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,520
everything you're going to do and ask at

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,360
a time and set up the data appropriately

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,990
and this is this is a huge shift right

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,540
it's more have a data engineer focus on

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,850
how you improve the flow the

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,760
availability of data really open that up

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,220
and then bring kind of micro services

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,540
and processing it to provide agility and

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:38,900
flexibility and really improve the cycle

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,640
times and adjustments and you know I've

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,290
said in the past it's not the company

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,030
with the most dated that's going to win

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,280
it's the company that's the most agile

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,440
right they can understand the context

00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,510
and and the appropriate action first

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,770
next one will Jack we look forward to

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,770
that future with you thank you

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,120
