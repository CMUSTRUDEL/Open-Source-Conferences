Publication date: 2017-03-15
Playlist: Strata + Hadoop World 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Human-machine interaction is no longer the exclusive province of science fiction. The advance of the internet and connected devices has inspired data scientists to create machine-learning applications to extract value from these new forms of data.

So whatâ€™s the next frontier?

Eric Frenkiel explains how to use real-time data as a vehicle for operationalizing machine-learning models by leveraging MemSQL, exploring advanced tools, including TensorFlow, Apache Spark, and Apache Kafka, and compelling use cases demonstrating the power of machine learning to effect positive change.

	00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,620
well good morning I'm very excited to be

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,960
here to be talking about machines in the

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,030
magic of fast learning so let me go

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,360
ahead and kick off the slide show in a

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,100
moment and we can talk a little bit

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,080
about what we're to be focusing on today

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,410
which is using a large corpus of data

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,349
and really referencing applications as

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,720
actors and data scientists as operators

00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:29,579
this is now possible because data

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,380
scientists are actually operationalizing

00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:35,399
data models and creating a synergistic

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,620
feedback loop with machine learning that

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,239
lets applications with faster data

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,500
scientists get more precise data and a

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,570
lot of great things in any given

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,769
business what we've seen of course

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,629
though is that there is a greater

00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:48,059
precision possible with this type of

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,100
positive feedback loop in addition

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,309
businesses can now tune what they're

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,809
doing in real time and lastly to get

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,550
ahead of the game it's all about

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,440
discovery and the ability to use these

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,379
same models and look ahead about what

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,609
will happen next but I'm here this

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,230
morning to talk about a very important

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,730
issue for us and it was referenced a

00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,939
little earlier about what can be done to

00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,979
help nonprofits working in big data and

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,020
in particular we're working with thorne

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,790
which is a nonprofit dedicated to

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,590
eradicated the exploitation of children

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,240
on the internet today and I'm regretful

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,490
to share some of these numbers because

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,350
they're downright shocking and very very

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,729
serious in the same way that we've seen

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,750
big data growth there's been more than

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,969
5,000% increase in images of sexual

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,950
exploited children online since 2007 and

00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:38,009
the fact is nearly half of all victims

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,659
need their perpetrators online first so

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,939
when we talk about creating a digital

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,399
defense and what Thorne is doing is a

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,579
very very important mission it's about

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,950
creating big data capability that lets

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,450
them move faster and more effectively to

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,659
find these children and return them to

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,000
their families thou'rt has to sift

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,890
through a vast amount of data daily more

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,899
than a hundred thousand ads are posted

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,450
on the public web alone each day in the

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,210
United States and when you look at how

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,610
this has to happen they're using machine

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,619
learning with facial recognition to

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,349
provide an ability to understand what is

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,120
going on in this any given image that is

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,940
posted on to the long view of the public

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,460
web

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,930
this happens by taking a raster to

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,320
vector conversion creating a point map

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,360
of a given safe and then in this ability

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,340
with more than 5,000 data points to be

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,620
able to apply on a given face they can

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,000
be duplicate they can classify a given

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,980
image and then effectively they can

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,590
correlate and match it all to help law

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,200
enforcement find that child and return

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,820
them to their family this is literally a

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,040
needle in a haystack type of problem

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,020
when you convert this you are literally

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,470
sifting through multiple millions of

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,210
images to identify this victim and they

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,700
have to do this every single time to

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:55,060
make sure that they don't miss any given

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,860
child mem sequel worked with thorns to

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,450
add a new capability that lets them

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,210
actually process this at a thousandfold

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,270
improvement time by adding a vector dot

00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,580
product operations database and going

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,250
directly to Intel's ad xq sims ii and

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,110
Construction Set you can now fully

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,610
saturate a processors pipeline and

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,310
effectively do more floating point

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,280
operations in a given cycle to make this

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,840
operation faster and in terms of what

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,130
this means this is the ability to take

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,430
what would be a positive match from

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,070
twenty minutes down at 200 milliseconds

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,600
so when we talk about real time it's

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,940
important to remember that it can have

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,160
very very important real-world impact

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,600
and as a matter of fact we have members

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,790
of the thorn team in the audience today

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,090
and if you join me in thanking them for

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,010
what they've done alone in 2016 they

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,239
found more than 2,000 children and save

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,470
them returns or family so if we could

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,470
get these guys around the pod

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,409
it's incredibly important to be able to

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,510
help big data challenges both in the

00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:59,129
foreign commerce and and nonprofits and

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,049
for me this is one of the most important

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,489
things I've been able to say how amazing

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,920
it is to help thorne achieve this

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,209
mission but to take a step back and

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,549
learn how we can apply this in other

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,769
areas there are so many different data

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,120
sets that are pure imagery based that

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,890
you can leverage machine learning to

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,160
gain insights whether it's mapping

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,109
social imagery or even forms that have

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,720
handwriting the ability to actually

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:22,620
apply machine learning at scale

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,979
accelerates a business's ability to

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,720
operate we've seen a number of our end

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,340
users engage with tensorflow to provide

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,560
a lot of this machine learning and it is

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,210
a phenomenal framework you can use to

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,860
dupe as a phenomenal data store just for

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,260
lots and lots of this blob data this

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,360
image data but the real question becomes

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,880
how can we actually accelerate that and

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,520
it actually turns into a lambda

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,919
architecture type of use case where you

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,229
use a message queue like Kafka to fork

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,570
the data both to the permanent data lake

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,970
view but also to a real-time in-memory

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,289
processing system with tensorflow and a

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,500
data store like mem siegel which has

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,270
high-speed vector algebra built in this

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,810
is then able to be rendered out to that

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,099
given model or application so later

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,150
today we actually have a few customers

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,940
talking about how they're using

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,860
real-time analytics at scale both uber

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,139
for business intelligence and how Macy's

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,750
is actually using it for real-time

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:17,220
dashboarding with click stream analysis

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,260
you can also join us later today to pick

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,750
up a book which goes into detail about

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,830
this type of learning called the path to

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,440
predictive analytics in machine learning

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,389
published by o'reilly and i want to

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,850
thank you guys of course for having me

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:33,109
here this morning thank you

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,109
