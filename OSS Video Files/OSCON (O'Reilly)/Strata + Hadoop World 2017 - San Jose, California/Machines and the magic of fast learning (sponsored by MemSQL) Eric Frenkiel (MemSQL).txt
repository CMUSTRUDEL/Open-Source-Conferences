Publication date: 2017-03-15
Playlist: Strata + Hadoop World 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Human-machine interaction is no longer the exclusive province of science fiction. The advance of the internet and connected devices has inspired data scientists to create machine-learning applications to extract value from these new forms of data.

So whatâ€™s the next frontier?

Eric Frenkiel explains how to use real-time data as a vehicle for operationalizing machine-learning models by leveraging MemSQL, exploring advanced tools, including TensorFlow, Apache Spark, and Apache Kafka, and compelling use cases demonstrating the power of machine learning to effect positive change.

This keynote is sponsored by MemSQL.
