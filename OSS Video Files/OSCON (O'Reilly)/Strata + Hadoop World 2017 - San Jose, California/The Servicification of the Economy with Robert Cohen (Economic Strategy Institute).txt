hi this is Mike Henderson from strata

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,759
Hadoop world in San Jose I'm here with

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,859
Bob Cohen Bob how you doing I'm votin

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,719
you're with the economic strategy

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,790
Institute right who are thing taking

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,259
Washington think tank in Washington and

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,929
you're you're focused on digital

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,390
transformation yes we've done a lot of

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,570
work on what happened what's happening

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,250
to the future of the economy and started

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,980
doing a lot of things on trade would

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:31,170
have also looked at different policies

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,870
for the industrial growth and things

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,230
like that and so I've been doing work on

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,899
a lot of tech related issues I mean we

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,879
started also doing a great deal of work

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,980
on the semiconductor industry and how

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,250
that was affected by Japanese

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,500
competition in the 80s and 90s and what

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,539
what I've done in the last 10 years has

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,300
focused a lot more on emerging

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,820
technology so I did a analysis of the

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,359
impact of grid computing in the last few

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,699
years we've gotten funds to do work on

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,189
how the digital transformation is going

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,900
to affect the US economy so I don't know

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,909
if it's an economic theory or not but it

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,030
seems like we're at a point in business

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,100
where it's either change or be disrupted

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,700
and once your industry being disrupted

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,930
right

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,180
is that part of is that I think it's a

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,509
difficult model to tease out because the

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,299
story is not so self-evident and I think

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,479
the other thing that's an issue is that

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,659
we see these big changes like the rise

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,439
of companies like Amazon or Google or

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,299
uber or Facebook and those statistics

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,750
don't seem to pick up I mean you don't

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,490
seem to see a big jump in some statistic

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,040
that's an indicator for the general

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,140
economy just because all these firms are

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,509
emerging and I think that's what the

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,880
story we're trying to tell that that

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,649
it's more complex because it's somewhat

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,960
hidden or underground

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,820
and we're trying to flesh that out and

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,439
are there key technologies that are

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,630
Navis so another one that comes to mind

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,640
for me is Airbnb right they're the

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,960
largest right hotel chain now or

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,459
something like that right

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,709
they're not really a hotel chain no

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,490
they're not a lot of there's a lot of

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,280
this is is what's called the service of

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,340
occasion of the US economy that we've

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,800
moved a lot of things that used to be

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,280
brick-and-mortar into a service offering

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,180
so some of the better examples of that

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,720
are kind of companies that used to sell

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:37,700
hardware like rolls-royce which had sold

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,670
engines to various aircraft

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:44,270
manufacturers and now they essentially

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,840
license their their engines as a service

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:50,720
so you're paying rolls-royce for number

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,110
of miles per hour and then they provide

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,150
all of the analytics and the support so

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,370
they can figure out you know when does

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,420
an engine need to be serviced and they

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:04,610
make money by kind of extending the the

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,950
length of time that that engines are up

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:12,380
and running and almost guaranteeing that

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:15,770
you'll have 100% assurance of flight

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:20,450
readiness so that but it's almost like a

00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:23,180
failsafe service and and I think that

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,820
this really changes the economy in a

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,700
couple ways one it means that we really

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,980
need to start looking at what's be

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,530
supporting this emergence of services

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,110
and in part a lot of that's what gets

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,900
addressed here I mean I myself have

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,140
looked at what's happening to the hours

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,180
to get business value in the whole

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,260
process of software development software

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,720
programming moving through things like

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,390
docker and micro services and up to

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,110
functions and we see the same thing on

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,360
the data side going from old hardware

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,690
data storage through software-defined

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:07,010
data storage and the value is becoming

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:09,100
much easier to to get to immediately so

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,080
this is introducing a lot more

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,540
unmeasured productivity in the economy

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,299
and far more value that people can

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,609
achieve much faster and you see this in

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:22,100
the bottom line for some of the

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,330
companies I mean even old incumbent

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,349
companies so there's a lot of saints and

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:31,080
the industry some is every company is a

00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:33,569
data company and every company now is a

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,729
server company every company is a

00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:43,229
hardware company I'm not sure I'd buy

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:45,419
that one but exactly exactly because

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,280
we're instrumenting the world right in

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,229
this whole transformation we're going

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,030
through right but as we instrument it

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,740
we're also digitizing it right because

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,430
it's gotta be connected and useful yeah

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,530
so every company is something now and

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,289
it's what they're trying to figure out

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,539
is how do they get there and right and

00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:06,389
out of the game more efficiency in the

00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:08,580
way they operate by having these digital

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,900
tools whether they're software or data

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,960
or or a mix I'm gonna see an increasing

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,960
kind of link between being able to do

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,090
the data analytics and having the skills

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,360
within a company or being able to draw

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,190
on skills that are more sophisticated in

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:32,039
terms of software development because if

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:35,599
you're creating more more sophisticated

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,949
data analytics you you need the software

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:41,219
understanding or the web understanding

00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:43,740
and and I mean one of the companies I

00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:45,449
know now has has really pushed the

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,849
envelope pretty far and what they're

00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,389
doing now is they're figuring out ways

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:54,810
to kind of channel inquiries so that

00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,879
they're addressed properly when they

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,120
come in from the customer so that's

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,250
almost extending the the evolution we've

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,440
seen in data and saying okay I can do

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,210
all these things in terms of data

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,460
analytics and abstracting doing

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,729
predictive analytics etc but I also have

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:18,569
to be able to respond very quickly to

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:20,370
outside inquiries and be able to send

00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:22,740
them immediately to where they should be

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,919
received so that the proper data is

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,779
there and I can give the response you

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,669
know almost in a fraction of a second

00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,669
and that's going to keep me much closer

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:35,050
to my customers I mean Netflix has kind

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:38,319
of demonstrated that that their whole

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,889
use of of data analytics has been to

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,879
kind of figure out how do they keep

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:48,159
customers attached to them and continue

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,250
to have them as knits Netflix

00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,870
subscribers so if companies are on their

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,250
digital transformation and I think one

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,379
of the biggest things that a lot of them

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,289
want to do they come from a large

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,330
central monolithic type software

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,909
development where they release a product

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,970
right and then they rerelease it months

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:09,340
later or whatever we're moving towards a

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,139
continuous delivery with an agile lean

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,990
method of building the software and

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,919
deploying it is that right for everyone

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:20,259
I mean I mean is this whole let's move

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,120
to this quick agile it's continuous

00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:25,210
deployment this is probably right for

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:29,169
somebody like Facebook or LinkedIn or

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,370
Netflix but for a bigger company like I

00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:37,330
don't know a Ford a Boeing Lockheed

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:39,190
maybe a UPS they they have a certain way

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,599
of delivering services or a certain

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:48,789
structure so I mean Ford has has done a

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:51,340
lot to kind of read configure its supply

00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:53,860
chain by using big data analytics and

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,750
they've built up an internal group over

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,449
the last four or five years that's now

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,210
going to be roughly 500 people within

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:03,729
the company so I mean they're not quite

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,729
as large as a Wall Street company and

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:09,219
its software and data analytic

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:11,860
capabilities but it's you know it's be

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:14,199
cutting to the stage where it's fairly

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,270
good-sized so I think that on some of

00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,389
these companies it's more how do they

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:23,620
take the old production structure and

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:25,690
really use the the new insights they get

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,630
from software development from big data

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,699
analytics to run it a lot better so like

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,279
in the last three or four years we've

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:38,860
seen Boeing which used to do almost

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:43,270
craft production of 737 747 when they do

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:45,640
the 787 it's almost as though they've

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,180
they've taken Toyota or Ford's

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,040
production line

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,140
and they're able to run it much more

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,270
efficiently and have much more output

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,030
because they've got these digital

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,850
capabilities in place so they really

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,500
jumped up a level compared to the

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,390
competition I mean Airbus has done the

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,470
same thing but this is a real

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,960
transformative change for a lot of

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,610
existing industries and I think they

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,890
recognize that if they don't do this

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,830
they're going to fail but I mean we've

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,290
seen it initially among companies that

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,110
are you know bigger have the resources

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,840
to build these teams but then all their

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,460
suppliers and everybody else sees that

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,670
you know we have to move ahead in a

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:32,900
similar way and so I think we're seeing

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:35,180
a much bigger kind of rollout of digital

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,340
transformation than many people expected

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,720
so Bob if we look forward 12 months from

00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,430
now we're in the midst of a digital

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,310
transformation most companies are

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:49,070
grappling with it in it their journey's

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,350
begun some of them are further along 12

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,440
months from now what do we see in the

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:59,120
economy do we do we see a noticeable

00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:02,860
change an uptick or do we see still the

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,800
kind of struggling to get there the

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:10,010
analysis that we've that I've done so

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,580
far suggests that the next few years

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:17,330
probably till about 2020 we're gonna see

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:20,570
kind of a churning and a changeover in

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,180
how companies operate not only the gig

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,590
economy firms but also a lot of these

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:32,830
old economy companies but that after

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:36,080
2020 to 2025 we're going to add roughly

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,790
five to seven percent directly to the

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,760
growth of the economy so we're adding

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:44,000
you know probably around five trillion

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,780
dollars over a five year period which is

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,510
not insignificant in the US economy and

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,520
it might even be bigger if we look at it

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:56,010
worldwide and that this would create

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,000
almost a billion jobs for the United

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,770
and those jobs are not automated jobs no

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,860
they probably they probably use

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:08,550
automation to do software development or

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,560
to carry out you know the the new

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,710
structure that's set up like at Boeing

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,110
you have people working with cobots so

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,150
that so it's kind of a mixed job it

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,160
changes the characteristics and the

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,640
skills of the jobs so my last question

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,670
for you then is based on that AI is

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,560
going to steal my job it's probably not

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,540
doing my job but it's gonna steal a lot

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,940
of different jobs yeah do you see that

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,470
happening and what cannot be impact will

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,570
that have that's one of the things we're

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,220
trying to look at I mean I what I'm

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,470
trying to look at and what I've seen

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:45,570
with some of these jobs that there's a

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:48,210
big uptick in the demand for some of the

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:52,740
software development and business and

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:55,370
data analytics jobs as Emma machine

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,140
learning and artificial intelligence

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:01,590
begin to be mixed into the business

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,440
system and that that then creates more

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:07,050
demand for people who have those skills

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,900
but also opens up ways to have people

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:14,790
with lower level skills also do things

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:18,360
that have been partly automated so what

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,630
what really interests me is will there

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,020
be some sort of link between automation

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:27,480
and machine learning plus the jobs of

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,150
the future or will there be the kind of

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,770
you know some people have said all these

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,410
jobs are gonna go away you know there's

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:38,040
a study from Oxford that says 40%

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:43,140
percent of new of US jobs will disappear

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:46,590
by about 2025 or 2030 five and what I

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:49,830
see in the work we're doing is that the

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,350
skills needed for jobs are changing so

00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,960
that we need a very different skill mix

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,610
within the workforce than we've had to

00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,990
date and you see companies and

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,570
universities and technical training

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,300
centers beginning to give people the

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,670
opportunities

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,180
get those skills either through internal

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:15,740
company training or or other more

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:18,620
traditional devices but what I'm trying

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,980
to address now is how significant is

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,830
this shift to a very different skill mix

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,250
and will that really grow the jobs that

00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:30,590
that are coming up in the future in a

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,200
different way or will we continue to see

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:36,380
a lot of automation and end up having to

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,360
tax robots to make up for the job how

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,400
much more humans be in the loop right

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,860
yeah right yeah so I mean I'm trying to

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,860
figure out you know will we see humans

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,490
stay in the loop but humans working in a

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:53,080
very different way so great sure with

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,080
you Terry thanks very much

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,589
