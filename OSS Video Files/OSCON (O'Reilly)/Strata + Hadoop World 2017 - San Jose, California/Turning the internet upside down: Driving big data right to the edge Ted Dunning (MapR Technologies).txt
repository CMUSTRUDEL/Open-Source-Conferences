Title: Turning the internet upside down: Driving big data right to the edge Ted Dunning (MapR Technologies)
Publication date: 2017-03-15
Playlist: Strata + Hadoop World 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	The internet of things is turning the internet upside down, and the effects are causing all kinds of problems. We have to answer questions about how to have data where we want it and computation where we need itâ€”and we have to coordinate and control all of this while maintaining visibility and security. Ted Dunning shares solutions for this problem from across multiple industries and businesses.

This keynote is sponsored by MapR.

wow that's quite the group there I'm

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:13,309
going to be talking today a bit about

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:15,320
how data is changing things but I'm also

00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,990
going to be talking about a fundamental

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,630
you could call a topological

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:24,410
morphological change in which the

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,420
Internet is turning upside down I work

00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,510
for map are we've made some pretty cool

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,450
announcements over the last few months a

00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,000
container preparation for big data so

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,910
that you can run ordinary programs you

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,190
don't have to be moving data off of a

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,810
cluster and back on to do this you can

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,570
run conventional machine learning

00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,980
directly against the cluster we've made

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,020
announcements about supporting

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,510
microservices and today what I'm going

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,870
to be talking about is how the Internet

00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,880
is turning upside down and how the

00:00:52,870 --> 00:01:00,040
announcement that we made Tuesday ties

00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:03,260
right into that going to go geeky here

00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:06,290
you can tell these aren't the glitzy

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,409
sort of slides so the Internet as its

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,400
shaped now is fundamentally driven by

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:15,350
just a few economic parameters

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,210
parameters include the fact that there

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:21,110
are billions of people who want to

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:25,970
connect to netflix or whatever and the

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,590
fact that servers cost less per bit when

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,610
they get a little bit larger or when you

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,860
scale them also governed by the fact

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,409
that the Internet has a bit of a

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,400
conservative nature if you put a bit in

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:43,010
one place it's supposed to come out some

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,400
other place conservation of bits there

00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:49,520
and that has shaped the Internet as we

00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,330
see it the consumer internet there are a

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,330
small number of large servers over on

00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,360
the left and a very large number of

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,729
consumers over on the right and because

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,490
of the inefficiency of connecting that

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,040
last mile all of those wires the total

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,450
amount of money is big on the consumer

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,739
side but because of the necessary

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,840
concentration in order to be able to

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:19,440
build a few servers that drive all that

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,010
consumed data the dollar density is high

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,660
on the left now these are lessons that

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,700
we've learned over a period of years and

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,860
we can now apply that as the internet

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,440
turns upside down I'll explain why the

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,620
internet will turn upside down but it is

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,830
turning upside down and we can say every

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,019
one of those lessons backwards now some

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,879
are uncharged so when we turn them

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,640
backwards they sound the same but a lot

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,250
of them are backwards so the internet as

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,730
its turning upside-down has machines on

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:57,000
the left but otherwise looks just the

00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:00,720
same just backwards the last mile

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,690
problem becomes the first mile problem

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,280
we have billions of machines yeah a

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,910
quick vote here anybody here have a

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,129
phone come on you could do it I'm pretty

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,540
sure most of you do anybody here have

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:19,260
two phones the machines win they

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,319
outnumber us even in this room now the

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,540
total dollars is large on that side but

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,579
the dollar density is high on the right

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,670
that means business margins will be

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,549
large and that high dollar density on

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,130
the right means that this is the key

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:40,590
market place if you want to drive

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:42,780
leverage for building this and that's

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,609
what we're going to talk about here and

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,400
what we're doing now the reason that

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,620
this has changed is because things like

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,829
all the valves and pipes there have

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,989
sensors an airplane engine costs twenty

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,650
percent more if it comes with a data

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,599
plan wind turbines measured the wind the

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,130
wind is measured by weather stations to

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,590
predict how the turbines are going to be

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,470
done ordinary generators like these

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,569
these water turbines are exquisitely

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,030
measured and then at the point of

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,829
consumption this is out in Big Basin out

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,250
in the redwoods in the middle of a hike

00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:20,039
we found a smart meter I have no idea

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,740
who was consuming the electricity or why

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,930
it was being measured and sent back one

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,360
of our partners is building free g

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,310
networks to go on to ship so that every

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,130
container can phone home

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,320
we talked about phones already every one

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,170
of those reports homes the towers have

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,470
edge computing in them cars do so it's

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,740
things emitting data that is changing

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:49,050
the nature of the internet what can we

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:52,290
do well now far builds a data fabric

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,810
that allows planetary scale data

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,820
analysis it allows you to build data

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:02,160
structures that are truly earth spanning

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,850
you can build systems that cross clouds

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,950
across data centers that work as a

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:15,090
single data object that cross into all

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:17,550
of that that allow us to separate

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,770
concerns application developers can

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,630
think of data going into a stream and

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,970
coming out on the other side but

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,060
administrators can break that stream

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,800
across continents we can have regional

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,290
data centers we're going to have core

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,820
data centers we can separate the

00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,720
concerns if everybody worries about

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:40,860
everything nothing can get done you can

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,080
act locally and learn globally you can

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,350
have regional centers that measure

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,230
things have that single data construct

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,060
also be present in a central data center

00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,700
where you can do machine learning and

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:58,280
then you can push models back out to the

00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:01,860
edge where action can happen locally

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,770
it's the same fabric all the way down it

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,010
has certain constants certain

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,200
requirements location awareness strong

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,710
local consistency things like that and

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,230
so this week we're announcing

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,900
convergence of this to the edge we're

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:22,820
announcing map our edge these are the

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:26,160
small dots here it's small node clusters

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:29,460
very small there's one on this stage an

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,150
entire cluster it extends things into

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,400
factories into oil rigs into hospitals

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,340
you can build medical device monitoring

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,700
and data motion systems very very easily

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,720
where the data moves cleanly you can

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,550
build can

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,080
did car applications we have multiple

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,270
partners doing that and it makes it easy

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,710
now before we get into that I just

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,560
wanted to point out that these things

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,220
are so small I mean I've got a server in

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,660
my pocket that didn't used to happen

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,620
even with the baggy pants that I often

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,420
wear it wouldn't normally fit so let's

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,870
see there's the cluster right over there

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,590
and I've got things spread around on

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:16,050
stage and elsewhere so what's uh let's

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:22,500
take a look at what's happening let's

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:24,360
slip over to the other display and are

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,550
we there we are so this is just a graph

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,480
but what's happening here is we have

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,850
these vibration sensors and we can

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,610
vibrate a little bit we have a bit of a

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:42,240
size there there's some sensing going on

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:44,970
there we can redo this display size it

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,080
up again we have sensors over there we

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:53,130
can measure vibration here in the middle

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:57,350
these are things very small devices just

00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:02,280
a few dollars talking to an edge cluster

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:04,979
talking to a very small Internet that's

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:10,169
the example that we have here if we flip

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:12,930
back here to the slides what I'd like to

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,180
invite you to do is engage with us come

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,520
by the map our booth we don't have much

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,460
time here to answer questions it's also

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,260
even difficult to see you guys but come

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,450
by I'm going to be giving another talk

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,580
that's much more technical today at

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,100
four-twenty we have a number of other

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,560
talks happening in the booth and we have

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,960
these clusters running into booth you

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,510
can see how it works you can see what

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,000
they can do that cluster over there with

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,200
the three nodes can handle 10 million

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,570
inserts per second it's an extraordinary

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,720
revolution in what we can do and how we

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,340
can do it so come talk to us thank you

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,400
very much

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,400
