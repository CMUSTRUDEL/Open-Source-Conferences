	00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,870
good morning I see a massive lights and

00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,380
a couple of phones and some hopefully

00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:13,990
interesting faces so I am indeed Rob

00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,580
craft so they got that part correct so

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,250
we're already on a good start I've got

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,580
four minutes and some change so this is

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,470
a buckle up and in hang on or it's a

00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,360
nice warm-up for an afternoon session

00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,590
where I get to spend closer to 40

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,789
minutes going through a little bit and

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,420
doing better justice emails been used a

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:36,940
lot like a year ago it was unicorns and

00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,769
sparkles now it's turning into real

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,030
science right there's people let's say I

00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:42,159
have a real problem I'm actually

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,420
addressing it using core machine

00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,129
learning capabilities some of you guys

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,329
are very much on the advanced curve for

00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,159
adoption

00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,569
this is a bit of an eye chart for those

00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,569
of you with particularly good vision or

00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:53,620
strong cameras with zoom the basic idea

00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:55,899
is I'm just trying to delineate between

00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,639
artificial intelligence as the science

00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,620
and machine learning which is a series

00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:00,999
of techniques and hopefully you guys are

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,159
hearing the fact this gets pretty

00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:04,570
practical pretty quickly it's great to

00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,340
have on your resume it certainly helps

00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,939
making a mortgage payment with it but

00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,460
it's also just math with some statistics

00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:15,070
a large chunk of data and a little bit

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,960
of smarts so for those of you that are

00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,579
hiring people don't get too excited but

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,399
still know that the talents really hard

00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,560
to find but this isn't magic anymore

00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:26,590
it's solving real-world problems so

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,159
let's jump right in he says vaguely

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:33,250
click we're using it we've been using it

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,679
for about 13 years so let me explain why

00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,609
and this is the core the core of the

00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:43,179
science search works at Google off

00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:45,219
roughly two and a half words about 10

00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:47,679
years ago it worked off of about two and

00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:49,390
a half words in about five years

00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:51,429
you guys can get where I'm going we're

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,859
gonna get two and a half words what we

00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:56,700
need to do is fulfill the intent in

00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:59,829
those words and there is a lifetime of

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,009
context that arrives the one

00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:04,600
get-out-of-jail-free for those of us in

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,460
largely unstructured data set businesses

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,319
is the fact that some people are

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,160
actually talking to Google now which is

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,560
awesome

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,270
because when you talk to us in an

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,710
audible form either through your phone

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,550
or through an on home device or

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,290
something similar

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,720
you typically talk to it like a person

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,850
so we get a full sentence so natural

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,130
language systems work great the more

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,280
words you give it and it also does a

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,290
pretty good job about making the point

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,540
that you need a large scale translation

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,540
services as well so the goal for a lot

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,830
of the services that I offer out is

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,630
backseat of the car with a mouthful of

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,220
bagel with kids screaming in the

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,710
background asking for driving directions

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,480
if I can understand that we're getting

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,170
pretty close to better than human in

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,510
this case we had a handcrafted business

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,500
rule driven search engine for many many

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,990
years at Google and it worked pretty

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,520
well if the following conditions were

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,590
true then these things were what I

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,350
wanted to have show up in the response

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,760
system some relatively significant work

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,730
went into hand tuning these kind of

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,200
tools we got into millions of rules and

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,300
what you found is you were creating

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,700
people that created rules to manage the

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,950
rules that created rules that was kind

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,510
of crazy so for those of you that kind

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,890
of get the idea that as the machine

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,200
learning lead there's got to be a better

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,120
way just like the infomercial there is

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,370
it's called machine learning so why

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,220
don't we try to map intent which turns

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,110
out to be a whole lot less verbs there's

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,850
a much fewer set of things that you

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,290
actually want to get done if you

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,060
understand the context for the

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,650
interaction with your system and this by

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,720
the way applies for human systems

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,739
interacting with people human systems

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,390
because some of these things are

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,160
business processes and systems

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,950
interacting with systems because many

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,209
times we all remember so a service or an

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,440
architecture is anyone getting chills

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,270
down the back of the neck and the hair

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,130
standing up all that stuff stills there

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,140
we know you run on this so how does

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,650
systems understand intent from other

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,450
systems

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,070
well there's natural language there's

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,080
machine learning that you can train

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,610
against the signal the type is signal

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,900
the shape is signal you get the idea

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,360
these things become largely automatable

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,820
for us the largest single improvement

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,920
we'd seen in many years once when we

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,600
flipped over from writing hand created

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,820
rules to machine learning generated

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,650
system one thing to realize is creating

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,489
those rules took years and years and

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,019
years at Google

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,109
it took three to four months to get the

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,390
first model in place very exciting stuff

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,160
I'll quickly flip through translate you

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,100
hold up the phone in front of an image

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,770
on the screen in the sign itself it

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,210
translates to 103 different languages so

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,350
you get the idea that augmented reality

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,000
is easy

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,440
with a phone with a decent camera on it

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,630
so that's where we're starting to say

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,890
the experience improves machine learning

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,180
is house improves but we don't say

00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,520
translate with machine learning it's

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,960
just really good translate driverless

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,690
cars have been mentioned a lot so I'll

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,340
skip way Moe is doing a lot of city

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,960
driving we've got a few million miles

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,090
there's many other companies working on

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,290
this as well it's very difficult to do

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,090
because you have a localized data

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,100
problem that needs to execute on small

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,740
devices know that the world is gonna

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,000
spin up several billion IOT devices the

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,400
vast majority of which will collect

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,590
masses amount of data for no incremental

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,060
value how in the world can you dig

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,400
through the data set it's a machine

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,420
learning problem guys all right so I'm

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,190
almost done

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,730
that's exciting last words for anyone on

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,980
stage there's a fourth box missing we

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,380
have large data sets you guys have large

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,600
data sets you have some degree of

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,010
modeling some of its awesome some of

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,260
them are bad but all of them are better

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,760
than a spreadsheet you have lots of

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,410
computation meaning it's better than

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,910
your notebook but it might scale to a

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,650
few thousand machines or in our case a

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,360
few hundred thousands machines per

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,060
prediction but there's a missing

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,920
ingredient here and that's in the seats

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,080
talent skill set and adoption curve on

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,580
tooling is the critical function from

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,240
getting away from unicorns and sparkles

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,530
in a real business problem of cases

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,300
largely the tool set for machine

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,850
learnings been moribund for 20 30 years

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,710
in cases we're tipping we're getting to

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,780
the point where now we can have a gamut

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,370
of offerings far left the previous

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,350
speaker a couple speakers earlier

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,850
mentioned tensorflow open source if your

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,280
machine learning scientist you want

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,820
advance the art start here roll your own

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,870
contribute code go nuts next stage up is

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,730
I want to fully automate an

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,560
infrastructure that does everything for

00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,600
me including for those in the room that

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,820
knows what this is hyper primer is a

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,430
shinto nning it is the darkest of dark

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,470
arts second maybe only to debugging a

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,690
neural network and that's roughly left

00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,620
to people who have no friends for the

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,000
people who do hyper parameterisation

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,980
searching you have a couple of friends

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,930
but you don't make eye contact so it's

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,130
that end of the curve on the far right

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,170
side is your where machine learning

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,400
exists and you just want to know what

00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,350
the hell someone's trying to say to you

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,910
what languages it in what's in the

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,530
picture how many cats are there because

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,700
we all know it is the cat photo right

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,229
because that's what the internet runs on

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,600
well your own business doesn't run on

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,910
this stuff so taking unstructured data

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,100
into structure insights is the far right

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,050
there's tons of slots across this gamut

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,640
that you'll see a lot of people putting

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,560
a lot of time and attention to make

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,540
machine learning an exercise of

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,020
engineering rather than exercise of art

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,730
so last pitch there's a big sparkly

00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,830
brain on pretty much all my slides it

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,860
beats the terminator logo or Skynet

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,160
jokes so machine learning main session
