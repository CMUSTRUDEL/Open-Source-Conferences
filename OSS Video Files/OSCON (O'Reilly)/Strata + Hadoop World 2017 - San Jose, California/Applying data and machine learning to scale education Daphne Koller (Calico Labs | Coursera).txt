Description: 
	Machine learning and artificial intelligence offer a powerful set of tools to not only build predictive models but also create value from large amounts of data from online learners, from behaviors on the website to discovery/search to applications. Refining these models and truly teaching them how to predict what learners need and want is a significant challenge in edtech—because of the diversity in learner backgrounds and goals, the scale and variance of learning content, and the challenge of correlating content to real-world skills.

Daphne Koller explains how Coursera is using large-scale data processing and machine learning in online education. Building on Coursera’s wealth of online learning data (24 million registered users), Daphne discusses the role of automation in scaling access to education that is personalized and efficient at connecting people with skills and knowledge throughout their lives.
