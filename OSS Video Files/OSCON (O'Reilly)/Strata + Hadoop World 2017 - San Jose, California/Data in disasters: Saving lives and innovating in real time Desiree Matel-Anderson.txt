Description: 
	Data to the rescue. Desi Matel-Anderson offers an immersive deep dive into the world of the Field Innovation Team, who routinely find themselves on the frontier of disasters working closely with data to save lives, at times while risking their own. Whether the team is in the Northeast during Hurricane Sandy making decisive decisions to automate damage assessments, in Boston exploring social media for a bigger picture of the Boston Marathon Bombings, or using drones to map data points to better understand the stability of the topography after mudslides struck Oso, Washington, the data the team is working with expedites response and recovery.

hurricane sandy was category two or

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,010
three by the time it hit the eastern

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,320
seaboard October 29th

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,840
it was a it was actually a combination

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,090
of not only the hurricane but a winter

00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,980
storm that was coming in so when the two

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,450
centers of the cyclones were swirling

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,040
towards the eastern seaboard

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,720
what we were getting was called the

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,939
Fujiwara effect where the Centers of

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,790
these storms were coming towards the

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:31,550
same common point a data point right and

00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,160
became a giant superstorm that came over

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,140
New York New Jersey Connecticut all the

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,750
eastern seaboard late in the hurricane

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,359
season it's also important to know that

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,100
with all of the the lunar rising and the

00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,739
the time of the month that we were in

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,809
we had rising tide so there was lots of

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,469
flooding in subways in fact round zero

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,809
flooded

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:53,570
there was Manhattan was dark candlelight

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,940
so there wasn't power in some areas lots

00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,800
of challenges in Hurricane sandy so what

00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,949
we did was we worked with a group our

00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,739
team at fit was Splunk to look at over

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:06,050
seven million tweets that were coming

00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,210
out from survivors to understand where

00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,530
the fear was coming from and when they

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,420
were having fear so we could figure out

00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,920
when they get resources out and how to

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,409
disclose the information in a timely

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,509
fashion so what you're seeing on this

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,710
graph is there's a couple of different

00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:21,140
rafts but I'm going to take you to the

00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,689
the bottom one to show you where it was

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,840
peaking sandy hit the eastern seaboard

00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,270
on October 29th but we actually saw the

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,689
fear spiking the words please help in

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:36,020
Twitter on October 30th and 31st so

00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:38,299
after it had struck land is where we saw

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,219
a fear happening so really change some

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,689
of the way that we operated and when we

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,460
worked with FEMA and the External

00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:46,159
Affairs team this information was

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:52,820
utilized to help plan out how to respond

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:55,070
data used in disasters for good couple

00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,390
different slides what what's important

00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,820
here is critical infrastructure in

00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,070
hurricane sandy power was out we were

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,659
running short on fuel there's a lot of

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,509
critical services and so these graphs

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,369
actually show the spike in the different

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,380
services in the need that was happening

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,050
with survivors in New York and New

00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,220
Jersey and on the eastern seaboard one

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,530
of the points I want to make is that

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,130
power was a big issue for people when

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,380
they didn't

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,790
power they were tweeting about it they

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,680
were telling us about the fact that they

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,030
need it they needed not just off the

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,830
grid they wanted their power restored

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,960
and being in the urban areas that we

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,010
were in we saw that as a big spike

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,010
during Hurricane sandy

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,000
