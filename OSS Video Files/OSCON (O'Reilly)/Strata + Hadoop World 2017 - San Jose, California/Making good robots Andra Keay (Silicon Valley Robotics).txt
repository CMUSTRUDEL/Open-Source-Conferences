Description: 
	Letâ€™s stop talking about bad robots and start talking about what makes a robot good. A good or ethical robot must be carefully designed. Andra Keay outlines five principles of good robot design and discusses the implications of implicit bias in our robots. We are encountering more and more robots in our lives, so we designers need to be creating good interactions or else we may wind up in a world of robot smog, robot spam, and robot stereotypes.
