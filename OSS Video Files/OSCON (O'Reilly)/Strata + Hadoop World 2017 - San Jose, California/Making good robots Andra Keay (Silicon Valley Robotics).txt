Title: Making good robots Andra Keay (Silicon Valley Robotics)
Publication date: 2017-03-17
Playlist: Strata + Hadoop World 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Letâ€™s stop talking about bad robots and start talking about what makes a robot good. A good or ethical robot must be carefully designed. Andra Keay outlines five principles of good robot design and discusses the implications of implicit bias in our robots. We are encountering more and more robots in our lives, so we designers need to be creating good interactions or else we may wind up in a world of robot smog, robot spam, and robot stereotypes.

the robots should obey our laws and that

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,090
includes all of our social covenants and

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,580
it also means that robot builders

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,039
technologists should have a

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,590
responsibility to consider all of the

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,730
social ramifications of the rollout of

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,950
their technology and to construct policy

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,590
that will help us inform our social

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,440
framework our legal and social

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,370
frameworks are designed to adapt and

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,850
evolve they are not fixed technologists

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,649
cannot claim that innovation exists in

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,920
some Switzerland like realm of

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,899
neutrality we can't afford to be

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,520
bystanders anymore either because the

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,079
current wave of common robots is

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,300
starting to reach every area of our

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,120
lives and they have a vast array of

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,370
being puts or senses and are starting to

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,660
be capable of taking a range of actions

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,399
even without physical manipulation

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,290
robots have face recognition I tracking

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,329
emotional detection voice recognition

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,209
natural language processing object

00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:12,359
recognition obstacle avoidance mapping

00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,920
path planning not to mention the things

00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,709
that common robots can do by being

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,799
connected to the cloud ie remotely

00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:22,049
access your calendars Google things

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,479
connect with Mechanical Turk so robots

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,999
are becoming potentially effective in

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,569
the world robots now have access to a

00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:34,170
whole range of data technical

00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:36,179
environmental social and personal we may

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,799
not be ready for humanoid robots yet but

00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,409
there are hundreds and thousands of

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,810
these mobile semi-autonomous platforms

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,090
moving into the world today some operate

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,609
completely autonomously many have humans

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,490
in the loop robots have left the factory

00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:53,219
and they're entering the real world with

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,499
an impact dr. Gill Pratt from the DARPA

00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:59,219
Robotics challenged said that robotics

00:01:55,499 --> 00:02:01,919
is having a Cambrian explosion now for

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,880
three thousand million years life was

00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:09,179
primarily single-celled organisms and

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,530
then in one tenth of that time we went

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,819
from two plants to fish to dinosaurs to

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,609
the first mammals

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,340
and biologists theorize that this

00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:22,769
happened because vision simple vision

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,719
became possible and that allowed an

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:28,590
increasing array of more complex

00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,349
organisms robotics is happening right

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,209
now because we've hit a certain critical

00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:36,379
evolutionary tipping point the low cost

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,150
of senses the increasing intelligence

00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,549
augmented by ubiquitous connectivity and

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,430
this is all leading to improvements in

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:47,060
mobility and manipulation of the

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,060
