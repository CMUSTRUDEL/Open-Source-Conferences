Publication date: 2017-03-16
Playlist: Strata + Hadoop World 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	The secret of life lies in our DNA. From Mendel to discovering the double helix structure of the DNA to decoding Chromosone 22 to the completion of the Human Genome Project, innovations in the field of molecular biology and genetics have empowered humanity with great powers to change and save lives. Whether by accelerating the pace of sequencing DNA data, using machine learning to edit offending genetics, or blocking a gene from functioning, big data processing, machine learning, and AI are changing the game on the state of the art in molecular biology and genetics.

Vijay Narayanan takes you on an inspiring journey exploring how the cloud, data, and artificial intelligence are powering and accelerating the genomic revolutionâ€”saving and changing lives in the process.

This keynote is sponsored by Microsoft.

	00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:08,200
I wanted to share a story of a boy a

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:10,510
fourteen-year-old boy Joshua Osborne who

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,280
was lying in coma at a hospital in

00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,429
Wisconsin about two years ago

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,289
Joshua's brain was swelling with fluid

00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:24,009
the doctors did a number of tests but

00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:25,779
couldn't identify the root cause it was

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,899
getting very frustrating for Joshua's

00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:32,500
parents and the doctors what could they

00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:35,160
do to save Joshua the doctors then

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,370
recommended one final test one more test

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,280
using an experimental technology in the

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,110
fire the first procedure of its kind the

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,000
tests would look at Joshua cerebrospinal

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:52,420
fluid four pieces of DNA he turned out

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,400
the test was successful researchers were

00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,040
able to look at Joshua's fluid

00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,820
cerebrospinal fluid and pinpoint the

00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,500
cause of his illness within a few hours

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,039
it turns out he was infected with an

00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,049
obscure species of bacteria doctors were

00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:13,630
able to eradicate it and save Joshua's

00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:17,049
life in a matter of a few days this

00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:20,130
ability to save Joshua's life comes from

00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:23,469
being able to analyze DNA sequences

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,710
right very quick time and had much lower

00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:29,289
cost today in fact the cost of DNA

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:32,469
sequencing has dropped from about 10

00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:35,259
million dollars in 2007 to less than a

00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:39,179
thousand dollars today at a rate much

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:42,039
faster than Moore's Law and

00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:44,799
simultaneously the number of human

00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:48,939
genome sequence during this period has

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:53,200
grown exponentially from getting the

00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:55,029
first genome sequenced in 2007 to having

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,329
the publicly available thousand genome

00:01:55,029 --> 00:02:00,729
data set in 2013 to the current

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:02,619
sequencing capacity in the world the

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,529
number of human genome sequenced is

00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:07,899
doubling every 7 months and this is

00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:09,880
placing a lot of stress in the computer

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,550
and storage infrastructure in these

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,800
centers a lot of these sequencing

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,580
centers and genomic labs are moving to

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,770
the cloud today

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,120
to address their computer and storage

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:25,960
needs it all started when a seminal

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,990
paper was published in 1866 the paper

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,380
based on years of studying visible

00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:36,190
traits in pea plants by a person named

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:39,520
Gregor Mendel an Augustinian friar in

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:42,700
the Czech Republic today Mendel showed

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,210
how invisible factors were shaping the

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,030
visible traits of the pea plants the age

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,250
of genetics was born and Mendel's work

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,680
really laid the foundation of today's

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,960
genetics but with cloud big data and AI

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,580
the pace of innovation in genomics is

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,330
accelerating in 1990 the genome mixed

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,940
community started on an ambitious goal

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,870
the quest to sequence all the 3 billion

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:17,560
base pairs in the human genome after 13

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:20,320
years they completed it two years ahead

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,260
of schedule and at a cost of a little

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,920
less than three billion dollars now you

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,640
might ask why is this important well the

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:34,000
human genome project today has already

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,450
led to the discovery of more than 1,800

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,060
disease genes and there are over 2,000

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,590
genetic tests today that patients can

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,200
take to learn the risks of their

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,209
inherited diseases and for doctors to

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,040
cure these diseases to diagnose these

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:53,020
diseases the human genome project has

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,540
really enabled a new generation of

00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,500
precision medicine today one that is

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,360
personalized

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,390
that's preventive and one that's

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,870
pre-emptive and with leveraging the

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,660
cloud and AI has helped the sequencing

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,560
analysis and diagnosis to run much

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,269
faster better and at a lower cost but

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,390
you might be wondering why is this a big

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,940
data problem let's take a look at some

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,859
of the big generators of data today and

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,940
extrapolate them by eight years to the

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:26,770
year 2025 Twitter today generates about

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,020
half a billion tweets

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,940
and in eight years is expected to need

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,360
probably about one to two petabytes of

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,370
incremental storage and year the largest

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,020
roster on immediate assets coming out of

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,870
the Square Kilometre Array that's going

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,849
to go live in 2020 will probably need

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,629
about one exabytes of incremental

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:48,280
storage every year YouTube will probably

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:52,300
need about one to two exabytes of

00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,729
incremental storage and here today there

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,580
are about 2,500 high-throughput genomic

00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,159
sequences in more than thousand centers

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,639
worldwide assuming a reasonable

00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:05,949
projection rate they're going to require

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,729
anywhere between 2 to 40 exabytes of

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:11,590
incremental storage every year and that

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:15,220
is just for storing the human genome

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:18,699
alone this will be the Big Data of the

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:22,870
future so what are the challenges for

00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:24,310
handling this genomics data at scale how

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,289
do you acquire and store this data

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,259
efficiently and cheaply

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:32,860
how do you process it and how do you

00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:34,690
derive intelligence from it let's take a

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,449
look at how genomics data is first

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,050
acquired and processed it's a simple

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:43,360
five step process first you extract and

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,360
purify a sample either your saliva or a

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,050
sample of blood then you use a

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,719
sequencing machine a machine that

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:57,279
extracts the DNA from the nucleus inside

00:05:52,719 --> 00:06:00,159
the cells in the sample and then you

00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,409
align each of these sequences this

00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,240
machine extracts about millions of

00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:07,900
different fragments of sequences each

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,719
about 100 to 150 characters long you

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,150
then align each of these sequences to a

00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:15,069
reference genome in this case a large

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,090
string that's about 3 billion base pairs

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:22,000
long fundamentally it's a very large

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,039
approximate string matching problem once

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,830
you have aligned each of these sequences

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,810
you then look for all possible genes

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,650
that can match in that location in a

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,210
process called variant calling and once

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,550
you have identified the gene that

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,770
matches you look for the difference in

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,030
the match between the sample and the

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,610
reference

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,130
and these differences the mutations are

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,950
then looked up against a knowledge base

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,330
to identify the impacts and the

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:54,460
implications of these mutations so

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,860
straightforward process but it turns out

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,740
that speed in this entire process is

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,500
going to be very critical if it's going

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,540
to be used by doctors for diagnosis

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:09,430
especially in life-threatening

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:12,520
situations so how do you go from sample

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,060
to sequence to alignment to variant

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,140
calling to identifying the mutations

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,500
understanding the effects all in a

00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:23,020
matter of a few hours really need fast

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,890
algorithms and a very scalable computer

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,350
infrastructure one breakthrough and

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,870
genomic alignment algorithms came a few

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,790
years ago from a lecture that Bilbo

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,670
Lasky and Ravi Pandya from Microsoft

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:39,660
Research attended in this lecture the

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,580
basic idea was to use a large hash table

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,710
basically hash to all the locations in

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,510
the human reference genome where a

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,390
sequence of characters in each of the

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:52,600
sequences can occur the invented a

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,820
technology called snap and snap is now

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,670
blazingly fast in alignment and in

00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,590
variant calling to give you a sense of

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,350
how fast it is it is about more than

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,570
seven times faster than some of the most

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:10,180
commonly used alignment algorithms today

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:13,360
and without sacrificing accuracy so this

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,850
speed in genomic analysis is enabling a

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,520
whole slew of new applications for

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,310
instance you can now monitor new

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,490
pathogens and identify outbreaks before

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,820
they can happen outbreaks like SARS or

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,590
the swine flu given the speed of snap

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,200
you can use it in controlling the

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,880
quality of the sequencing process as the

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,400
sequencing process goes through you run

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,530
snap figure out whether the quality of

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,620
the sequences are good if not go back

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,350
and redo the sequencing process very

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,960
often there are new reference versions

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,240
of the human genome that are released

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,450
you can also use snap then go back and

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,059
remap historically aligned sequences to

00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,430
the new reference genome

00:08:54,059 --> 00:09:01,089
all this is enabling a virtual cycle of

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,619
genomics and AI today the genomics data

00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,930
that's being collected at a high

00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:06,730
throughput is being analyzed by faster

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,579
and more intelligent algorithms on the

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,579
cloud that's enabling a file slew of new

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:14,920
applications which in turn is generating

00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:18,420
demand for more new data to be generated

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,889
more new genomic data to be generated

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,829
cutting-edge research in genomics is

00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:25,889
also now going beyond diagnosis and

00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:28,889
looking at treatment options as well

00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:31,569
using a technique called gene editing

00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:34,749
the idea of gene editing is very simple

00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:37,689
you give the biomedical researchers a

00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:40,449
way to make very precise and targeted

00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:43,059
changes to the genome now why would you

00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:46,660
want to do this well there are two

00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:48,459
reasons the researchers can totally

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,800
knock out or disable a gene and

00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:53,980
understand its function for example in a

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,369
mice or if they know the function of the

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,850
gene and if it's a faulty gene say in a

00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:03,519
human they can insert new DNA to restore

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:07,509
the original function of the gene this

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,949
sounds fantastic and the magical tool

00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:14,230
that's enabling this is called CRISPR

00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:22,269
let's look at how this whole gene

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:24,069
editing works the caste 9 enzyme there

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,860
is an enzyme called the caste 9 enzyme

00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:29,920
that is shown in grey orange there that

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,069
is really like a molecular scissors it

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,120
binds to a strand of DNA of RNA called

00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:39,579
the guide RNA the guide RNA takes the

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,970
kazna in enzyme and targets a specific

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:46,449
location of the genome the caste 9

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,980
enzyme this snips the DNA and cuts it

00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:50,980
it's like a molecular scissors that just

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,369
cuts the strands of the DNA after the

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,379
cut you can either insert new gene you

00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:58,629
can either insert new DNA to restore the

00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:02,920
gene or you can disable the gene

00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:06,009
completely it turns out that the very

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,240
critical step to enable gene editing is

00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,779
to figure out where to

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:15,130
at the genome it turns out there are 18

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:18,850
billion combinations of guide RNA 300

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:21,430
guide RNAs about 20,000 human genes and

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:26,110
about 3,000 target locations on the

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,370
genome and there are two characteristics

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,820
that you want to keep in mind you know

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:33,190
for gene editing first of all given all

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,100
these guide RNAs you want to pick that

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:39,610
RNA which is able to target a specific

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,300
gene that you want to go and and modify

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,640
the function of second one you want to

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,399
reduce the on target activity the

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,740
probability that the guide RNA is going

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,600
to take the caste 9 enzyme and damage a

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,640
different part of the gene than you

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,670
originally intended that can lead to a

00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,240
lot of side effects and it's nearly

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:04,600
impossible to quantify measured all of

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,820
these deficiencies in a wet lab the more

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,810
realistic alternative is to approach

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,820
this as a big data and a compute problem

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,940
researchers from Microsoft and from the

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,829
Broad Institute at MIT and Howard have

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,950
invented a new technique called CRISPR

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:24,130
ml the machine learning based technique

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,430
for identifying which guide RNA to use

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,490
to target each of the 20,000 genes in

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:33,070
the human genome it's basically like

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,820
similar to a website ranking for

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:38,589
relevance CRISPR demo looks at all of

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,360
the guide RNA the properties of the

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,040
guide RNA is the properties of the genes

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,870
the thermodynamics of the DNA and a

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,870
bunch of other characteristics and

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,240
builds a machine learning model to rank

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,779
each of the guide RNA in their target

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,839
efficiencies and using the power of the

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:58,870
azure cloud to scale they were able to

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,399
compute and store all of these on target

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,079
efficiencies and the off-target

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,779
activities in a matter of a few days now

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:11,020
if you want to see for example which

00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:12,610
guide RNA to use to target a gene you

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,959
enter the name of the gene in this

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:18,880
CRISPR ml tool and you get back the

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,250
scores both the on target and the off

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,300
target scores from this genome or from

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,370
- this is really amazing progress in

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,850
jeanne editing in just a matter of a few

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:34,449
years very short few years using CRISPR

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,860
ml researchers are finding about a 20%

00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:38,560
improvement in their targeting

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:44,230
efficiencies and about a 50% reduction

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:47,230
in the time and cost per gene so today

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:51,670
we are at a tipping point where Gino

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:54,699
makes the cloud data and AI are

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,600
empowering researchers to save and

00:13:54,699 --> 00:14:01,060
change human lives we in the data and a

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,149
a community can partner with these

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:07,810
researchers in a quest to understand

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:12,570
what makes us us thank you

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,570
[Applause]
