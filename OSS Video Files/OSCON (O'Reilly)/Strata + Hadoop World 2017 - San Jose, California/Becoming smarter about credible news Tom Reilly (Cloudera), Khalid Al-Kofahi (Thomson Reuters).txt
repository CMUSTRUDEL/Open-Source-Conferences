	00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:08,340
to prove that this application is not

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,759
fake news here in the stage we're gonna

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,469
do a live demo so you can see it I think

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,160
it's time for us to go see the our

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:20,400
rights and so this isn't news yeah and

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,890
forgive me sometimes some pictures

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,990
especially around crises and casualties

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,630
may show up so if it shows up forgive us

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:36,540
guys we don't control the news there

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:40,740
this is real all right so what you see

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,960
here are four channels a user can define

00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,330
their own channel so here I predefined

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,870
four channels the first one we call it a

00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:52,820
crises there is no terms it's just based

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:56,130
on in the newest and the past 24 hours

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,170
we I see it up to be loosen the facts so

00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,640
show me things that look like rumors so

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,409
many things that I'm not necessarily

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:07,050
accurate etc and underneath it you see

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,290
some of the events that we are capturing

00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,090
the next one is trending and you see the

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,830
life updates because I'm hovering here

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,500
on top of it the updates stopped so that

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,880
I can see it this cluster contains seven

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,270
thousand nine hundred and sixty eighty

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,590
tweets if you click on it it's about the

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,630
shooting that happens in the furniture

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,130
school I think it just happened this

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,320
morning yes that just having the small

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,900
initially this is live you can see that

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,840
the concepts and the topics that we

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,720
algorithmically extracted and other

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,690
concept is cetera this means that it's a

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,659
newsworthy this means that we believe is

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:49,500
true yeah we defined a couple of more

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:51,570
clusters crisis bomb blasts etc we

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,120
defined one on from taxes so if you

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,310
click on there on the actual a cluster

00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,460
you see I actually built this channel

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,130
this morning with yesterday so this is

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,520
running life yeah and so to answer the

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,129
original question how accurate is it and

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,170
detecting the distinguishing between

00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:12,930
faking news rumors and actually news or

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,440
in news stories we are about 84%

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,200
accurate

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,710
on it sweets on even that has at least

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,290
five tweets not 500 just five we can't

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,560
distinguish between rumors and through

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:29,380
assertions of facts with 78% accuracy in

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,480
code who are the users of this who sits

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,940
in front of the screen so this is this

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,970
is meant initially was meant to scale

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,000
our journalist yeah they can't monitor

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,310
the news life from firehose they can set

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,600
up keywords it's just too noisy so we

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,870
have journalists who set up these

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,700
channels and they monitor them for news

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,560
words so journalists in Lebanon who has

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,540
interests about local things can say

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,120
these are these are the topics these are

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,100
the the information I trust and build

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,690
their own channel absolutely and they

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,610
monitored life and everything here is

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,900
indexed and searchable and all kinds of

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,550
analytics on top of it that you can

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,110
imagine in addition to Jordan Ellis this

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,560
is running live with our financial

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,960
customers we define sort of channels

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,730
that has a potential to move the market

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,920
or relevant our financial customers and

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,410
they consume it life without any human

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,120
intervention with a veracity score to

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,980
tell them you know maybe it's not

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,220
completely true maybe it's true and so

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,220
forth

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,430
