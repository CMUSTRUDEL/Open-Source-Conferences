hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,490
hadoop world in san jose i'm here with

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,830
Jason Waxman from Intel Jason how you

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,040
doing good if I get keynote this morning

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,710
I did and you kind of talked about the

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,870
things that Intel is involved with

00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,779
mostly around artificial intelligence AI

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,529
yeah can you unpack the layers that you

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,990
guys have at Intel around AI sure sure

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,699
you know it's a you know very complex

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,859
subject and there's a lot of different

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,430
elements to it but you know at our core

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,230
we are a data platform company and and

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,480
when you think about that there may be

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,760
many different types of use cases you

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,950
might be looking at an autonomous

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,829
driving car you might look at a wearable

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,469
such as you have on your rest they're

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,719
all producing data and that data

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,570
requires compute and it requires storage

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,190
and it requires memory and those are

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,160
things building blocks that we didn't

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,620
tell avoid sort of dealt and so we look

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,899
at various layers to the AI stack you've

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,870
got the underlying silicon that drives

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,339
the performance for AI you've got the

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,549
storage in the memory which we also

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,880
participate in as well above that you've

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,860
got libraries that are required to go

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,530
optimizing for such as algorithms for

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,280
deep learning a lot of investment we

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,130
have there and then actually providing a

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,960
platform and a set of solutions that

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,280
allow others to build on compliment so

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,979
you might be familiar with some of our

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,380
software assets whether it was a Nirvana

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,329
acquisition for deep learning or the

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,240
saffron acquisition for reasoning

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,430
systems they are our building blocks

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,320
that allow somebody to integrate a

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,100
complete solution we have a very tight

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,560
partnership with Cloudera on the data

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,000
hub side of things and so we really look

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
at how we put all of these pieces

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,530
together that ultimately drive a lot of

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,729
data that requires a lot of compute and

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,009
that really kind of comes back to our

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,460
core so at your core it's interesting

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,869
your core is data rather than silicon or

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,090
chips or machine it's kind of

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,179
interesting

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,069
from an Intel so as you see I OT and

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,769
devices and as we instrument the world

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,780
is that part of your strategy because

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:18,080
you're seeing so much of this in the

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,150
wild absolutely you know again our goal

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,549
is to make sure that if it requires

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,980
compute or acquire storage and data

00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:27,170
requires both of those that were helping

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,090
to go enable it and that really supports

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,220
our growth I don't think there's anybody

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,430
in the planet it does a better job of

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,739
driving cost-effective compute in

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,500
cost-effective storage and that's where

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,180
are our fundamental strength is but that

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,709
means that we have to look at all kinds

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,810
of platforms that are giving off data

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,450
and you look at the amount of data that

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,549
an airplane gives off or the amount of

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,280
data that is required to create our

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:56,299
medical records these are all usages

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,790
that require both intelligent IOT types

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:01,970
of devices through a network which we're

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,849
trying to help evolve to be 5g to a data

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,360
center that largely built off of Intel

00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:10,480
Xeon processors so we really look at

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,340
these solutions from from end to end

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,989
well in those solutions if you look at

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,780
your industry verticals that you're

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,120
working with Intel's done some really

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,099
interesting projects with companies and

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,139
different industries can you talk a

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,180
little bit about maybe it's medicine and

00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:27,920
transportation and other areas that you

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,769
guys have been working in yeah you know

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,380
we've been working in in health care and

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:36,620
personalized medicine for a long time

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,389
and you know dr. Eric dishman used to be

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,900
a part of Intel and is now you know part

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:46,489
of the efforts in Washington these days

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,859
he really set this goal to say we really

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,470
ought to be able to all in one day be

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:54,859
able to go help diagnose somebody with

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,870
very very complex of health care types

00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,720
of issues and that means bringing

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,930
together genomes means bringing together

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,910
electronic medical health records and

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,280
creating a personalized medicine and we

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,889
know that the real weeded great way to

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,799
treat very difficult diseases such as

00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:16,410
cancer as you have to really personalize

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,290
the approach to your lifestyle to

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,269
your genetics and and and take how much

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,250
more targeted type of approach that

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,600
requires a tremendous amount of data so

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,270
we've been during the number of

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,720
different efforts one as an example we

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,790
were doing wearables to diagnose and

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,430
help to be able to treat things such as

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,110
Parkinson's disease we were engaged with

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,500
the Michael J Fox foundation to help

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,320
event some of that effort we look at the

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,120
application of deep learning to medical

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,490
imaging I talked earlier today about

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,200
work that we're doing in China to be

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,780
able to improve died on cancer to be

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,590
able to improve thyroid cancer detection

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,620
rates through through imaging we also

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,720
are looking at how can we bring together

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,520
the pool of genomes that's being

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,550
collected they're all in these silos

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,350
across industry and we've initiated what

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,020
we call the collaborative cancer cloud a

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,090
data exchange if you will for genomes an

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,340
open platform that allows institutions

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,350
to come together and it's really by

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,360
connecting all of those different data

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,400
sources that were really advancing the

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,890
mission toward personalized medicine

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,100
such as one example so do we ever get to

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,080
a point with healthcare to wear one

00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,010
hundred percent preventive so healthcare

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,010
insurance is not an issue I mean I ever

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,580
affect I I would I would I would love to

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,680
get there but I think there I think over

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,360
time we will be making great strides I

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,280
would love to get to the point where no

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,830
one ever has to get cancer anymore

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,110
because you can see the steps along the

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,080
way and nip it in the bud but I think

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,210
we're a long way and so ai ai can take a

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,490
lot further in a lot of areas so one

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,500
could be transportation I mean yeah you

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,150
know we look at I look at California

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,450
came from here remember the East Coast

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,070
we're aware of good transportation

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,410
systems built right are we ever going to

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,700
get like that worldwide again we ever

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,800
going to get transportation under

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,860
control you know there are some amazing

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,510
projects right now that that there's

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,130
sort of two elements that you can tell

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,840
there's a lot of focus on economist

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,340
driving a number of announcements we've

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,280
been kind of public about some of our

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,680
work with BMW as an example to go do

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,900
that but there also are very smart their

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,580
number of smart cities projects

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,040
all around the world I know Singapore as

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,440
an example is really trying to lead the

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,600
way there and it's this combination of

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,009
getting you know vehicles that are

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,560
hopefully safer and and can really help

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,910
manage that overall flow were good but

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,370
you know if you've ever been on the

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,039
highways in Oregon the whole merging

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,600
thing is not you know great you could

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,180
you could do a lot better if you had no

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,740
car that obviously know how to build

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,139
alone that's right that that makes a big

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,139
impact in in traffic but then there's

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,780
also the intelligent routing and we're

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,449
seeing cities put together these

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,430
networks of smart cameras where they can

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,800
you know on the fly really start to

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,810
re-route traffic as a result change the

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,330
signals change the lights to really help

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:19,169
remove congestion all of it's just a

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,690
giant network of cameras and vehicles

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,699
and other types of devices together we

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,090
require tremendous amount of compute

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,710
Network and storage obviously to really

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,160
turn them into an optimal system so

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,570
compute networking storage and also

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,300
infrastructure and hardware at the base

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,160
level yeah you got by the way I've yeah

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,940
I view it still as you know whether

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,639
you're looking at a smart camera or the

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,810
compute inside of a car or the computing

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,820
side of a data center it really

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,169
fundamentally comes down to there's

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,090
compute required to do some sort of

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,310
function different right I may be

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,800
looking at trying to decide is the

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,360
object that entered a road a ball that's

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,610
the compute that's happening at the car

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,620
and then I may be aggregating all that

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,449
into the data center it's really analyze

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,760
is there a pothole on the road into if

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,380
the rear at traffic as a result but all

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,990
that winds up being compute just

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,940
distributed across different devices so

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,770
Jason if you and I were to sit down here

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,470
a year from now and have the same

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,289
discussion what would you like to say is

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,090
on the road map for Intel that you guys

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,190
have accomplished by the time we have

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:26,280
that discussion what what what is in

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,560
your near future and then take a step

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,630
forward even from that the year after

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,710
that what would you like to see you guys

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,830
are going to be doing on that journey

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,520
yeah so I think number one is we are on

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,060
the path to deliver the best AI

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,130
platforms

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,830
in the industry bar none and what I mean

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,320
by that is sort of two attributes one is

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,900
that it delivers the best performance

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,630
per dollar as you know a lot of these

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,170
solutions are compute intensive and so

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,640
to be able to train systems we want to

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,990
provide breakthroughs and that's going

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,339
to allow much more breakthroughs in the

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,529
actual science itself so we have to

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,170
deliver the best performing per dollar

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,730
platform on the planet the second is we

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,279
want to be able to create a number of

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,890
open platform initiatives that really

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,830
allow innovation to occur and obviously

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,990
intelligent transportation is one of

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,420
those areas and autonomous driving cars

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,570
another one would be in health care

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,279
particularly a big mission for me is I

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,230
really want to find a way to aggregate

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,400
all the genomes that we have across

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:32,970
different institutions and allow drug or

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,580
pharma companies or other institutions

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,010
to be able to access that data and to

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,390
drive innovation so I'm pretty confident

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,070
that we'll be talking about our updates

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,160
on that next year and the next year and

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,550
then take take it out let's say what is

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,040
your dream where big can we dream and

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:55,290
when can we get there yeah you know it

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,960
just taking for example medicine for a

00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,400
little bit I think delivering that best

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,470
platform we're going to see better

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,330
diagnosis of images we're going to see

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,990
more remote diagnostic types of

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,400
solutions that will be in houses and and

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,339
and line as i mentioned trying to bring

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,380
together the pool of electronic medical

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,790
have some health records with genomes

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,560
those are things that will happen in the

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,990
short term it's really the bringing

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,700
together of all of that that really will

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,200
lead to personalized medicine and i

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,060
think we're still on the track that in

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,740
the next three years we're going to see

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,560
solution that will be rolled out by by

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,810
healthcare institutions that will allow

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,640
for much more specific treatment for you

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,410
and me to have a much better quality of

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,760
life that would be a great thing so

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,060
Intel Inside may have a different

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,510
meaning yeah hope so very good thank you

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,510
very much for your time

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,920
