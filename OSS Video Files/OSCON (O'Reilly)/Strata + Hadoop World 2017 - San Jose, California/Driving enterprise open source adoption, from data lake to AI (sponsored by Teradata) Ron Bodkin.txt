Thank You Roger well it's a pleasure to

00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,700
be here excited to talk to you today is

00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,830
Roger noted I came I spent many years in

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,820
the big data space and excited to take

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,889
you through a little bit of the journey

00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,930
that we see enterprise is taking and how

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,910
we're helping from the foundation of

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,820
analytic insight of trusted data massive

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,369
scale to the driving real-time response

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,590
to really help people build autonomous

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,199
systems and into the exciting future of

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,029
artificial intelligence which leading

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,639
enterprises are getting serious about

00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:36,039
today that's an increasing focus of mine

00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:37,690
in my role as well in a new role

00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,719
iterative the CTO services and

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,010
architecture now let's start the

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,859
foundation of analytic insight is

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,539
incredibly important so we continue to

00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,670
see the importance of the power of

00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,829
integrated data at massive scale to

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,889
provide descriptive analytics and indeed

00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,629
machine into powered machine learning

00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:57,969
where turned in a database continues to

00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:59,769
be second to none now available in a

00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,289
borderless way where it's available on

00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:04,689
Amazon and assurer as well as in

00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:06,670
software and hardware deployments but

00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:08,829
that really complements the recent

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,259
movement towards data Lakes founded on

00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,869
Apache Hadoop but increasingly we're

00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,130
using apache spark and seeing that as a

00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:17,289
foundation for how to do data

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,450
transformations on your data lake and

00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:21,039
apache knife i as a way of doing

00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,799
distributed data collection based on

00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:25,390
open source we see it's incredibly

00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,890
important to blend the commercial and

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,810
open source ecosystems and our

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,640
enterprise customers where they want to

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,499
integrate data warehousing with data

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,270
lakes to work well and increasing the

00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:36,310
digital world the pace that change the

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,960
data means you can't afford to model all

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,939
the data up front but you ultimately

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,320
want to model the high-value data you

00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:43,030
know being able to have access to that

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,280
data and a raw form you need a

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,899
high-performance query engine so presto

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,429
is something that we're proud to be

00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,679
partnering with Facebook and developing

00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:52,990
an open source to it's a system that

00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,749
Facebook uses the process petabytes of

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:59,679
data every day in raw form and is now

00:01:55,749 --> 00:02:01,659
the foundation of services such as the

00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,729
fina on amazon right so we see

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,280
enterprises leveraging that and we're

00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,649
excited to be significant contributors

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,420
to make it enterprise ready we also see

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,920
it's important to have technologies like

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,290
query grid that leverage presto to

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,030
integrate commercial technology with oak

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,239
source to make it easy to integrate

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,349
those data sets for broader use and

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,780
excited to see things like charity

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,120
that's after now running on Hadoop and

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,590
leveraging spark integration as well so

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,329
that foundation of analytic insight is

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,400
important one thing that's important is

00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:31,989
building data lakes that scale and our

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
industrial so we're excited to announce

00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,739
the open source release of kylo a

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,739
framework that builds on spark and IFI

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,859
to support various different roles in

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:43,769
using data Lakes so allowing ETL

00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:46,209
developers to contribute while allowing

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,790
Java engineer spark engineers to build

00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,069
the foundation templates and processors

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,689
and to make it easy to do monitoring an

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,389
operation on data flows so I'd encourage

00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:58,720
you to go to kailua or stop by our booth

00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:00,879
today to learn more about kylo beyond

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,430
that foundation we see it's incredibly

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,829
important to have real-time response to

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,709
be able to take in streams of data using

00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:09,849
technologies like spark or commercial

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,010
version of that which charity to offer

00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,859
is called listener as well as stream

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,900
processing engines like spark or flink

00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:18,549
on top of Kostka to really drive

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,169
real-time response not only in

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,109
interactive applications but also

00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:25,540
machine learning and finally this leads

00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:27,459
us to the opportunity to really apply ai

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,470
and the enterprise so what we're seeing

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,019
is the foundation of rapid progress in

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,639
GPU power and innovative research

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:35,530
research like Michael Jordan talked

00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,109
about it Berkeley at places like

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,030
Stanford and Google and Microsoft right

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,040
there's lots of fundamental research but

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,930
what's so exciting is we're seeing the

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,239
enterprise is now starting to really

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,540
embrace and see practical use cases

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,329
applying these innovative techniques on

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,530
interesting statistic I saw the massive

00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,790
increase in the number of public

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,319
companies talking about artificial

00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,859
intelligence of their earnings reports

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,419
so the the c-suite the board at most of

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,310
your companies are thinking about this

00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,290
how can you apply it right well we're

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,780
excited to bring our depth of knowledge

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,209
around open source and analytics to help

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,489
customers succeed with optimized

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,949
hardware with software integration and

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,169
consulting around use cases like how do

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,720
you do visual search from a mobile app

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,970
to find products that are relevant for a

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,529
given product somebody may be interested

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,080
in maybe they're pointing to a pinboard

00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,389
maybe they just take a picture or

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,740
anti-fraud where what

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,020
the important techniques we see is

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,120
blending neural networks deep learning

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,129
with traditional techniques to have a

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,259
better result similarly around

00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:39,509
recommendation engines right the ability

00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,029
to use a neural network to learn general

00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,650
categories to say these are the kinds of

00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:45,029
things that people like this are

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,279
interested in but then memorize

00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:48,779
exceptions there's a popular case where

00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,669
this specific thing happens to work

00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,770
really well or not work well and we're

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,020
also seeing a lot of use in the

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,360
automotive industry not you know we all

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,430
hear about self-driving cars but we're

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,379
helping companies with practical use

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,490
cases around how do you make driving

00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,210
better and provide better information

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,710
today using these techniques now I want

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,120
to point out that not only or technology

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,550
like tensorflow it open source

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,340
incredibly important but so is the rich

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,039
community of research applying this with

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,750
open source communities on github right

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,699
so being able to take those and apply

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,189
them turn them into production quality

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,379
code is incredibly important a lot of

00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:27,240
times we you know that you combine how

00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,169
do you have massive scale training on

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,860
GPUs with effective commercialization

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:36,539
using serving frameworks to make this

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,189
deployables for real-time response so

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,710
I'm really excited about the fact that

00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:42,360
AI is no longer in the science fiction

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,520
movies but it's really being applied in

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,149
the enterprise at scale and with that I

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,339
just want to recap the the importance of

00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:52,169
the journey to establish the analytics

00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,300
foundation to get to a real-time

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,289
response system so that you're ready for

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,240
the future of artificial intelligence

00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,520
and we're excited to be a part of that

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,220
journey with our customers thank you

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,220
