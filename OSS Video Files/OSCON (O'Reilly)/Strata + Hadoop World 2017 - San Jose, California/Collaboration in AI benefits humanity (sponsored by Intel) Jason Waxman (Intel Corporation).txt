	00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:09,570
good morning you know it's um pretty

00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,560
apparent that AI is transforming

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,720
industries and one of the things that's

00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,119
great about the work that we all get to

00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,460
do is to get up every morning and know

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,680
that we're we're making a change to the

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,900
world but the important part is that

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,970
we're making changes that are for the

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,609
good and for the benefit of society and

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,980
there's numerous examples but just to

00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:33,219
kind of cite a few that I'm very excited

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,769
about in healthcare we're seeing how the

00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:38,890
use of AI can improve the the

00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:41,379
correctness of diagnosis and on top of

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,649
it we see that their use cases for

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:47,199
remote diagnostics or patient care as an

00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,299
example monitoring a patient with

00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,549
Parkinson's disease very difficult to

00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,559
put a doctor in every home but with the

00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:56,769
use of AI we can really monitor the

00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,989
progression of the disease in finance

00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:00,969
we're looking at how AI can make the

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,729
world safer for fraud detection we've

00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:06,640
seen huge use cases for identification

00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:08,550
fraud very well-established but also

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,840
looking at how enhancements to

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,350
compliance can be made or how can a

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,050
flash crash potentially be prevented we

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,930
see AI also of course being used very

00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,360
heavily in transportation it's no secret

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,970
at this point that Intel is very bullish

00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,900
on the notion of autonomous driving cars

00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,300
and on top of that we see how how all of

00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,730
that data coming from autonomous

00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,980
vehicles and from other vehicles out

00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,320
there the camera and the video data can

00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,630
be used for enhanced search and rescue

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,510
and other types of applications so with

00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:47,800
all of this change we like to see it

00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:50,890
coming up to what we call AI for good we

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,720
like to see the positive sides of AI and

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,810
how we together as an industry can

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,880
promote these use cases I don't to give

00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,680
a couple of examples one of my favorites

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,950
that we're working on at Intel right now

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,710
is with J's Young University in China

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,289
and what they recognized is that to be

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,859
able to do adequate radiology in a

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:14,739
country of 1.3 billion people but it's

00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:15,490
widely distributed geographically that

00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:18,150
the use of a

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,070
I could improve Diagnostics and allow

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,260
those people who may not be the most

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,290
experienced doctors to be able to do

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,060
adequate identification this study that

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,530
we did with the University was on the

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:35,410
identification of potentially cancerous

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,320
thyroid nodules what we found was that

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,390
we studied a panel of educated and

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,410
experienced doctors and they basically

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,360
achieved a 75% rate of adequate

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,790
prediction what we're able to optimize

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,540
with jaejoong we were able to get the

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,490
system to be able to do 90% accurate

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,110
prediction rate that's huge

00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,210
we now have already rolled this out in

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,280
production and thousands of patients

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,410
have already been screened using this

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,540
type of care so it's a great way of

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,430
making them real better collaborating

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,220
with universities researchers to be able

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,250
to optimize a platform that improves the

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,070
world around us but sometimes it's not

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,050
just the actual analytic solution that

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,140
needs to drive collaboration it may be

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,820
the data in some cases as well as an

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,390
example when you look at the population

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,640
of genomic data a genome a false fully

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,710
sequenced genome can require one

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,570
terabyte of data and as you might

00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,990
imagine moving all of that data between

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,940
institutions is not necessarily the most

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,950
cost-effective or or palatable way to

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,570
make it happen so we've been working

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,070
with the burrowed genomics Institute one

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,140
of the leaders to be able to produce a

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,920
toolkit for high performance analytics

00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:51,430
and a very very scalable a database for

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,450
for storing genome data but then taking

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,340
it one step further

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,920
we've been driving technology in

00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,940
partnership with Ontario Cancer

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,130
Institute Dana Farber and OHSU on what

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,410
we call the collaborative cancer cloud

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,990
and the idea behind this is proving out

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,760
the technology that each institution can

00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,340
have their own genome database but as

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,620
you can imagine the improvements in

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,330
prediction really come from aggregating

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,400
and sharing all of that data and if we

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,770
can provide the distributed databases

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,840
enable the level of security and the

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,910
privacy protection required we can

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,620
really aggregate together a much bigger

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,620
population of genomes

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,720
it certainly is applicable that AI is

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,150
good for industry and whether that's

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,490
health care or financial services or or

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,460
transportation but we also see that AI

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,980
for good can be applied to the benefit

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,050
of society as well and one use case I

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,100
wanna highlight here is the National

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,220
Center for Missing and Exploited

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,290
Children it may shock you that that in

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,600
the United States alone over half a

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:59,710
million children are reported missing

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,230
each year and the process by which neck

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,900
Mac which is a nonprofit goes by trying

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,690
to identify and and support and help

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,590
save children is there a manual one they

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,230
get over ten million cyber tips reported

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,270
a year about children at risk and you

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,520
can imagine that deluge of data is just

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,740
mind-numbing to be able to go through in

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,050
fact unfortunately sometimes it can take

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,760
as much as 30 days from the timeline

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,280
where it's reported to when it's

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,190
actually dispatched out to law

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,200
enforcement agencies we can go reduce

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,940
that time and our mission at Intel is to

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:39,250
be able to take that down from 30 days

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:42,460
to till one day to make AI for good a

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,320
reality it has to be a very complex set

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,130
of technologies and as you in this room

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,270
know integrating Internet of Things

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,070
distributed platforms security ingest

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,770
reasoning systems deep learning all

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,479
together as extremely complicated and we

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,320
view it as our mission to really

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,520
democratize AI to enable AI for good to

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,770
make sure that there's both the

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,720
computing power and the open platforms

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,240
out there and in fact we recently

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,820
launched our umbrella portfolio called

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:18,040
the Intel nirvana portfolio to advance

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:20,410
AI for good so I hope that you'll join

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,060
us in our mission in collaborating

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,729
whether that's at the platform level

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,110
whether it's at the AI analytics level

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,180
or whether it's potentially

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,890
investigating data sharing if you're

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,690
interested in more about learning about

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,130
our technologies or initiatives or

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,289
sharing your own thoughts about how we

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,090
can advance AI for good I hope we can

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,960
see you later at our booth thank you

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,880
very much

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,880
