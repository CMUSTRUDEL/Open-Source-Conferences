	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
hi this is my conviction from strata

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,310
hadoop world san jose I'm here with

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,290
Brian would Brian how you doing great

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,970
Mike are you I'm doing well so you were

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,620
taran'atar I am you guys have been

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,960
around for quite a while we have any

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,490
Benatar strata hadoop event for quite a

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,020
while as well that's right so can you

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,699
tell us what you guys are up to what's

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,189
new with Tara dating sure so we got a

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,310
lot going on Eternia I cover the cloud

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,930
area i'm in cloud marketing the specific

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,310
thing that I'm really kind of one

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,050
emphasizes last week we made an

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,330
announcement about our new managed cloud

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,180
offering we call it teradata intelli

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,430
cloud so this is new in the sense that

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,600
it's not our first managed cloud

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,329
offering it's more of a second

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,600
generation and basically regardless of

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,950
deployment choice what our team does is

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,660
managed the infrastructure for customers

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,090
for their cloud deployment so whether

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,610
it's in our data centers or an AWS or

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,289
soon on Azure we provide a set of

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,020
infrastructure services for them so they

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,219
can focus on the data and analytics so

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,539
it's pretty exciting for us we have a

00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,460
lot of customers that use the kind of

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,140
version 10 and so the expanded

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,359
capabilities for the second generation

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,400
so cloud is the structure as a service

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,290
yes well it's not infrastructures and

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,689
services more software as a service yes

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,760
so we're talking specifically about

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:14,490
teradata database or kind of flagship

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,530
data warehousing offering and then aster

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,570
analytics then as well as to do both

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,540
cloud era and Hortonworks so you have a

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,880
whole stack we do or for a partner we do

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,310
so you you could take a large retailer

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,810
or someone from finance or whatever and

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,280
provide this whole stack of data for

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,630
them that's right that's right now

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,540
traditionally so taran'atar has been

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,420
around for over 35 years and for a long

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,570
time we sold on premises equipment so

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,640
large you know rack mount rack size

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,680
things that go in customers data centers

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,119
there was the physical platform and the

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,090
software and they were tightly

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,680
integrated and that was basically how

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,750
we're able to ring the max performance

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,340
out of those systems now with cloud

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,500
deployments we're basically taking that

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,200
very same software virtualize and

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,880
virtualizing making available in AWS in

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,429
Azure on vmware and and then also so not

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,009
only is a deployable in various modes

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,940
but some customers want to manage that

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,190
infrastructure themselves and I

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,120
in fact most of them do not necessarily

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,310
want to manage that infrastructure

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,320
themselves so that's where our services

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,970
come in where these cloud services are

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,310
really targeted and you have hybrid to

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,590
where they're partially locally managed

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,210
and then partly on York we do in fact

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,520
hybrid cloud is a key part of our

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,560
strategy we define hybrid cloud is this

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,030
customer environment using a mix of on

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
premises with some sort of cloud

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,200
deployment managed cloud private cloud

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,030
public cloud and it's the same software

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,290
regardless of those deployment races so

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,630
customers don't have to think about

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,950
which features are in this environment

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,320
which features are not in that

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,330
environment new you know and that slows

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,800
things down that's some friction so by

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,840
having the same software regardless of

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,520
deployment choice makes it seamless for

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,700
them to move data and queries and

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,950
workloads across so the regardless of

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,810
that again some customers don't want to

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,160
do the infrastructure management even

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,230
though public cloud providers make it

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,910
very easy provide lots of tools there

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,580
just some folks don't want to do that

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,350
and and they would choose to focus their

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,450
time and their people and resources on

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,890
higher value add things so that's where

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,390
our service comes in and so I would

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,670
imagine to their highly regulated

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,910
industries that have to have some of

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,190
their own stuff scrolled away and also

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,380
have their business to run that probably

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,700
could be off premise that's right so you

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,790
try you're probably a good mix for

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,410
someone like that as well that's right

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,620
teradata targets very large entities

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,930
typically global 1000 type companies so

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,900
they are multinational in general very

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,040
distributed they many of them are highly

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,010
regulated industries like I said

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,190
healthcare finance insurance so some of

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,380
them choose to remain on premises with

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,239
all their infrastructure but we actually

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,670
did a survey last year of customers and

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,670
one of the results that came out was by

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,640
2024 just three years from now ninety

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,709
percent of the folks surveyed indicated

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,410
they'd have a hybrid cloud environment

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,560
in other words less than ten percent are

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,209
going to be only on premises or only on

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,880
clouds the vast majority are going to

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,739
have some sort of mix and for those who

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,419
want to deploy in the cloud we have our

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,580
environment is very secure we've had

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:21,200
third party audits for things like PCI

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:25,560
HIPAA enemies

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,050
hihi barriers of compliance so you've

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,970
incorporated that into the service so

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,440
it's a highly secure environment so

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,669
those who want to deploy can be assured

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,210
that you know we're going to take care

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:38,190
of them and and keep the door locked is

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,130
that a hot thing right now is security I

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,680
mean I think we all know what certain

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,040
entities around the world can do to

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,850
wreak havoc into security right and you

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,950
guys have a lockdown system we do we do

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,660
now it's a shared security model like

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,300
anything where there's a customer and a

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,190
service provider so we handle up to the

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,580
infrastructure level so there's physical

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,800
security the data center itself access

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,800
to the infrastructure in terms of our

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,630
processes that's what those compliance

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,910
audits are all about is are we doing

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,639
what we say we're doing and we following

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,560
the best practices for for security that

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,660
goes up to the infrastructure level now

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,180
on top of that comes to data and the

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,650
application and the analytics themselves

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,540
and that's really the customers

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,490
responsibility so we draw a very clear

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,960
line make it clear what side of the

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,840
fence were on what side offense the

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,760
customers on it's a shared model and of

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,060
course we're both monitoring things very

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,740
closely but that you know clear

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,300
communication like always is the best

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,960
way to make sure there aren't any gaps

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,789
or over lapse in security model so if

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,080
you were to look out 12 months from now

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:50,639
and predict where you see teradata 12

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,190
months from now and where you see the

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,490
industry what would you what would you

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,680
say is going to happen so increasing

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,900
cloud adoption and that's not

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,610
necessarily taking on prem stuff and

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,320
tossing it out the window and moving it

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,630
to the cloud is typically adding clouds

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,910
that hybrid environment so there's a lot

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,789
of data gravity on premises so there's

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,470
no use if ain't broke don't fix it so a

00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,240
lot of times they keep those on-premise

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,820
systems going but they expand into the

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,400
cloud a lot of new customers start in

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,930
the cloud because this is much lower

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,490
entry point kind of digital natives to

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,380
begin with our wings equity and a lot of

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,690
the new data is born in the cloud so

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,490
again no use moving that you play it

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,300
where it lies so to speak kind of like

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,310
the Gulf metaphor so more cloud adoption

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,830
we see

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,510
that's where this hybrid approach is

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,850
increasingly important not having

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,290
different features or capabilities in

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,150
different environments because that gets

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,740
complicated very quickly so if you can

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,270
have the same capabilities regardless of

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,560
where you want to use it and you can

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,180
have choice and whether or not you have

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,340
to manage it and do the underlying stuff

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,350
then there's great benefit in that we

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,490
think that more and more companies will

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:02,540
deploy in the cloud and and so not not

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,130
of not a massive change in how they're

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,590
doing business but starting on the path

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,480
of having the the capabilities to take

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,090
advantage of cloud so you see any

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,790
industries that are head in getting

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,950
their cloud presence established and

00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:19,100
working versus any industries that may

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,930
be lagging a good question so the second

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,790
one's kind of easier the more regulated

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,140
industries tend to be more conservative

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,240
and slower so they're kind of

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,860
necessarily the laggards what we've seen

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,510
is a lot of the media companies whether

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,610
the digital companies that you know have

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,830
online content and digital assets and

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,650
things fate we've in our experience have

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:44,050
been the more progressive in deploying

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,050
to the cloud again it's generally not
