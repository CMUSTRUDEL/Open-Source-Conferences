Title: The machine-learning renaissance Mike Olson (Cloudera)
Publication date: 2017-03-15
Playlist: Strata + Hadoop World 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Data is powering a machine-learning renaissance. Understanding our data helps save lives, secure our personal and business information, and engage our customers with better relevance. However, as Mike Olson explains, without big data and a platform to manage big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence just donâ€™t work.

so what is it that happened what is it

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,250
that his alert allowed us now finally to

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,059
realize the value of machine learning

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,359
finally to learn from our machines the

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,220
two trends that have driven Big Data to

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,179
such success in the market have also

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,149
driven AI nml forward the algorithms

00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:30,869
that the early researchers that current

00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:33,239
practitioners use are ravenous for data

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,790
and we finally have enough data on the

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,550
planet to feed them they also need

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,900
scale-out computation and storage at low

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,000
cost and that's led to the proliferation

00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,950
of Hadoop and spark and a lot of related

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,140
technologies but it's also meant that

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,450
finally we've got the computers we've

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,500
got the data we can do this machine

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,720
learning thing cloud era focuses on the

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,190
largest enterprises as customers in the

00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,020
world what we call the global 8000 the

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,380
8000 companies that make a billion

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,350
dollars or more in revenue the appetite

00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,259
for this capability is insatiable among

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:13,679
those folks they've absolutely got the

00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:15,929
data at scale 2013 in New York City on

00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:17,520
the Strada Hadoop keynote stage I

00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:19,859
announced that Clara was embracing the

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,020
Apache spark project we pulled it in to

00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,819
our platform at the time we did that

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,600
because we believed that it was going to

00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:30,899
supplant MapReduce as the deployment

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,079
platform of choice for data processing

00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:35,639
and analytic workloads in Hadoop and you

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,530
know what that's absolutely come true

00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:39,450
right MapReduce is still important still

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,119
relevant folks still use it but new work

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,819
on the platform in general happens on

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,789
spark or on other new frameworks not so

00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:51,840
much on MapReduce anymore spark

00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:54,810
introduce though a new capability the

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,299
impact of which has actually taken us by

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,459
surprise it allowed people to build and

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,670
deploy scale out machine learning

00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,289
applications much faster than they had

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,240
previously done it's flexibility its

00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,789
ease of programming meant that you could

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,860
build ml apps deploy them train-up

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,840
models on massive data very very quickly

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,269
and that

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,129
led to huge interest in the ecosystem

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,810
that we've worked with the open source

00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,580
community with our strong strategic

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:25,160
partner Intel to optimize spark for ia

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:28,430
but also to take all of the great open

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,019
source ml libraries that snap into spark

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,910
so think about ml Lib think about

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,590
tensorflow think about all of the

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,510
innovation going in the going on in the

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,310
open source community make sure that

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,069
that takes advantage of arithmetic and

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,280
other support on the chip and by the way

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,140
you will see this field continued to

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,900
advance at a furious clip in part

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,700
because of the investments that hardware

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,849
vendors are making you also that y'all

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,090
saw that Intel made a fifteen billion

00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:58,940
dollar acquisition of mobile I the

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,160
ability to drive hardware platforms and

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,650
the software algorithms that run on them

00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,540
forward in tandem is going to make

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,970
artificial intelligence machine learning

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,400
advanced analytics even more consumable

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,140
so if you've enjoyed the pace of

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,720
innovation so far fasten your gravity

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,180
belts you ain't seen nothing yet the

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,250
enthusiasm for this is intense you see

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,540
on the slide more than 400 of our large

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,590
customers were running spark and

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,120
production on a variety of these

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,690
workloads they all want to apply ml to

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,690
business problems

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,220
