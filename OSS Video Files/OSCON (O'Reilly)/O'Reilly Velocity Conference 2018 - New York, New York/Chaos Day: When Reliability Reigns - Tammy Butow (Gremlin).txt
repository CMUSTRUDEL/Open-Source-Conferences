Title: Chaos Day: When Reliability Reigns - Tammy Butow (Gremlin)
Publication date: 2018-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Tammy Butow explains how your company can use Chaos Days to focus on controlled chaos engineering. Similar to Hack Days, Chaos Days encourage an open culture of engineering. However, instead of focusing on building features, Chaos Days help you focus on building more resilient systems and reducing incidents.

	00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:06,509
so why would you run a run a chaos' stay

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,460
apart from that it's really fun business

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,809
continuity planning something that many

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,730
of you would have heard of especially if

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,590
you work in a highly regulated industry

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,179
like finance I previously worked at the

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,369
National Australia Bank for six years

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,600
and I did a lot of say disaster recovery

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,279
testing to do the BCP work so business

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,439
continuity planning is really important

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,349
but often it's a little bit old-school

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,880
so you might run your experiments but

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,380
you wouldn't have them automated you

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,050
wouldn't run them regularly you might

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,489
only test your BCP once a year chaos

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,070
engineering is all about doing this

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,930
frequently all the time and actually

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,579
running the experiments automating them

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,079
and just continuing to run them and

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,960
thinking of new experiments that you can

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,910
run and add so think about it in

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,969
relation to BCP but it's much more

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,030
advanced there's a lot of inspiration

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,190
for hack days but chaos days we have

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,559
game days which are actually created by

00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,699
Jesse Robbins at Amazon so he's to

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,199
actually go around and pull out the

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,320
cables in the data center of the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,420
machines yeah that was like the game

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,970
days at Amazon in the early days now we

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,890
can do it with software capture the flag

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,570
from security engineering I also worked

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,790
as a security engineer at the National

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,200
Australia Bank for some time and I like

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,340
to take a lot of inspiration from that

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,290
too and this is where you hired

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,090
vulnerabilities and issues and then you

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,460
have to send your team out your company

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,770
out to try and spot them or even people

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,390
out in the public and then also hack

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,540
days and hack weeks and these were

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,009
created by Yahoo many many years ago and

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,479
yeah it is more focused on product

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,850
development feature development so I

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,360
love the idea of chaos days to focus on

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,680
resilience why would you want to do it

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,840
you know there's been so many outages

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,399
recently that have made the press and

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,619
that we've been all talking about there

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,930
was that big s3 outage there was also

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,630
you know slacks gone down quite a lot

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,329
recently that's constantly in the news a

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,869
lot of airline outages as well like for

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,939
example this Delta one and I myself

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,469
actually was able to achieve a 10x

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,600
reduction in incidents for the

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,579
database's team at Dropbox because of

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
doing chaos engineering experiments and

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,349
how did I do that I actually started at

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,360
Dropbox and I set a goal to reduce it

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,800
not by 10x that was pretty impressive

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,470
actually set a goal to reduce

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,960
by 20% but managed to get a 10x

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,400
reduction in three months and yeah all I

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,980
needed to do there was look at the top

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,600
issues and actually run experiments for

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,220
the critical systems the critical

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,230
components what which which we had to

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,420
look after on the databases team so

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,130
don't go for low-hanging fruit go for

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,580
the big wins and you can really achieve

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,580
them

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,650
