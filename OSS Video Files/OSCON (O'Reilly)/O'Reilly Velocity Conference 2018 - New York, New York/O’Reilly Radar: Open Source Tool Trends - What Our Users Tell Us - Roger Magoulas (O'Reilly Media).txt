what is radar this is where we share

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,090
what we're paying attention to and what

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,690
we use to help plan like what our next

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,860
conference is what our next topic is

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,839
what we think is going to be happening

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,289
in the world around us and we do a lot

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,730
of trend analysis and use a common

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,070
combination of qualitative and

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,199
quantitative methods and external and

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,779
internal data and Nikki was just talking

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,240
about Safari and that is one of our

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,059
internal data sources and we use that to

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,739
help figure out trends and and topics

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,320
what I'm going to share is some of what

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,210
we find from search and usage on the

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,820
platform so for those who don't know

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,780
much about the platform it's 50,000 plus

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,160
titles there's text video audio

00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,399
interactive stuff live online training

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,050
so it's really multimodal and it's a

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,320
pretty big group of people two and a

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,140
half million users that's made up of 50

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,390
100 different companies a lot of big

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,700
companies 60% have more than 10,000

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,439
employees 68,000 individual users and

00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,299
what happens is a lot of them are doing

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,830
things like in an order you know start

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,840
to finish but many of them are kind of

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,700
nonlinear and are just going in to find

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,619
the answer to a particular question and

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,210
while they come from all sorts of

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,490
verticals they're kind of concentrating

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,299
and consulting finance banking software

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,470
and computers and even the consulting

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,790
companies that are small are probably

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,310
working for big you know big firms so

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,640
this is kind of an enterprise scale

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:37,710
audience and when you I show you the

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,200
results of things that we're looking at

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,320
consider that maturity because newer

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,479
Tecates to get more attention things

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,180
that are mature generally people already

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,290
know them tech also takes time I'm gonna

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,390
Tek some about what's going on with

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,750
cloud it's been around long enough but

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,180
there's plenty of kind of like legs in

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,530
it it looks almost emergent and pay

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,270
attention to the scale of things because

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,719
some things are big small things tend to

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,439
be more volatile and I'll talk about

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,750
search now the search data we have 2 + +

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,970
million searches a year some are very

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,650
specific so I can look at top searches

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,980
talk a little about what programming

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,670
languages and some moai topics so we

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,709
look at the top searches that's when I

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,989
explain this chart quickly on the left

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,900
you'll see that the the names of the

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:31,470
search terms they're ranked whether the

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,870
rank changed a lot the red horizontal

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,290
bars represent the magnitude and then

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,090
the chart to the right of that is the

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,299
change so the more to the right the

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,400
green bar is big change up red means to

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,109
change down so and look at what's going

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,109
on here two things really stand out

00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:53,670
kubernetes is the fastest growing big

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:55,560
topic and blockchain is also a big topic

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,389
here when we look at things that are

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,139
more in the kind of velocity space we

00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:02,700
see that AWS interest is growing we see

00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,159
a little decline with docker and micro

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,810
services but I think there's something

00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,650
going on that I'll explain later I'm

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,200
going to show that there's some evidence

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:15,269
going on around changes in architecture

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,379
if you look carefully at the first chart

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,660
you probably notice that there's some

00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,099
JavaScript frameworks and a Java scream

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,519
framework if you put those all together

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,560
it puts JavaScript out top in Java but

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,410
it doesn't change that javascript is

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,470
down a little bit while Java and Python

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:35,099
are up again we see this as evidence of

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,780
something that's that's going on when we

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,220
just look at programming languages we've

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,690
already gone over what the top ones are

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,019
but these are the ones that are growing

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,690
the fastest go Kotlin and rust now Colin

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,419
and rust are pretty small base but

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,810
clearly people are looking into them and

00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:54,959
paying some attention to them now in

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,370
machine learning and I was happy to hear

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,019
how much machine learning was covered in

00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,040
this conference I think's gonna be

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,919
something you're all gonna have to pay

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,930
more attention to over time tensorflow

00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,400
is the most well known thing but you can

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,400
see there's a slight decline in there

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,409
and what is going on is these kind of

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,150
smaller things are maybe getting a

00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,709
little more attention these days they're

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,229
newer and there's something to explore

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,609
so Kara Speight torch and the concept of

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:19,620
reinforcement learning which is

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,440
something that I think is really worth

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,870
watching hey that was search which is

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,560
like a little more real time and and

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,180
kind of bigger topics so

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,440
we'll talk about usage and this kind of

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,110
represents the kind of interest

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,090
intensity we'll talk about how it breaks

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,180
down in general and then some specific

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,750
things so about 80 percent of the usage

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,660
on Safari is for generally tech topics

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,860
and software development is the biggest

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,500
one and then kind of your topic here the

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,700
velocity topic data web mobile now

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,280
what's going on is there seems to be a

00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:01,520
movement towards software development

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:04,250
and data and a little bit away from the

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,979
web ops kind of web apps and some of the

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,960
DevOps topics again I think this is more

00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:13,880
evidence of what's going on with

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:17,300
changing architectures so when we look

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,550
at the usage the top topics we see AWS

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,740
with this big growth and big increase in

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,630
interest so the cloud despite having

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,180
been around for so long for this

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,320
enterprise oriented audience is really

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,930
getting a lot more traction we also see

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,350
a ml and AI is the next biggest growing

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,570
topic and and probably not a surprise

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,930
given all the hype and actually all the

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,580
implementation we see around it so I'm

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,900
going to go into little specifics on the

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:51,830
cloud in general when we look at overall

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,680
cloud topics it's up quite a bit that's

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:59,570
up about 70% AWS as I mentioned is up

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,450
200% Azure which is about half the usage

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,810
as AWS isn't growing as fast in Google

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,860
cloud from this very small base is it's

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,690
growing at about a hundred percent

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,460
year-over-year and there now with

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,910
programming languages we see the same

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,500
thing going on at top the the same three

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,340
and I think what we're seeing here is a

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,430
real coalescing around these these top

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,460
languages we also see the slight decline

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:34,419
in JavaScript and then the increases in

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:37,099
in Java and Python we also see the same

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,169
emerging languages ones that are showing

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,330
a lot of growth there this is kind of

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:43,700
reinforcing what we saw in

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,520
search I also want to point out that see

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,150
is is up here as still a pretty popular

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,860
language and we think but that's partly

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,650
what's going on with see is around ml

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,800
and AI where a lot of the code

00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:02,720
underneath the bindings are done in a C

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:05,630
language now we also see kubernetes is

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,210
up 200% blockchain is up four hundred

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:12,440
and fifty percent so these are things

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,000
people are definitely exploring and one

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
thing about kubernetes that we think is

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,290
interesting because we've been tracking

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,670
things for a while with ml and AI a lot

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,010
of people go in and kind of test the

00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,220
waters you know how to tensorflow work

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:27,020
how does neural networks work and try

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,810
things out but we don't think people go

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,840
into kubernetes casually kubernetes is

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,000
really for implementation and the big

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,970
growth in it both in search and usage is

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,500
really telling to us and I'll be talking

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,960
about that a little on the next slide so

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,800
what we're seeing is a cloud is a pretty

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,610
important topic the platform we're also

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,860
seeing that in the kind of ml space that

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,600
it's a growing space and we're seeing

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,700
that while tensorflow is clearly the

00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,800
most popular implementation that things

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,560
like Carris and reinforcement learning

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,690
and pi torch are worth paying some

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,700
attention to now we'll come to the thing

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,230
I've got this next architecture up here

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,400
I've been presenting this evidence

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:16,190
JavaScript down kubernetes this big

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,440
increase we see the language is kind of

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,030
changing you know the distribution what

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,380
we think is going on is that there is a

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,570
cloud-based micro services architecture

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,700
that allows a lot more flexibility in

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,800
how development is done that is going to

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,420
be the kind of next architecture and

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,610
what we mean by next architecture is

00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,620
that when you have that next project

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,510
this is likely the architecture you're

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,860
going to be using it has so many great

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,570
features that we've been hearing about

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,000
this whole conference and hopefully been

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,980
learning about it in the sessions for

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,630
building these big scale things and

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,070
really meeting a lot of great business

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,560
needs you know that kind of feature

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,260
flexibility feature agility being able

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,720
to scale and so forth so

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:00,110
we really think the evidence is is there

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,720
that this is a direction that we're

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,540
gonna be paying a lot of very close

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,500
attention to the last thing is just that

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:12,830
blockchain is so you know showing up and

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,970
so hyped these days now we don't really

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,710
know what's going to happen with

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,840
blockchain I think the notion of

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,330
distributed trust has some really

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,000
interesting prospects but what we

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,280
suggest with it is that a lot of people

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,620
are paying attention to it and that you

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,080
probably should too and just develop

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,890
your own opinions on on what you see

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,540
there so that's the end thank you if you

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,660

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,670

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,410
