Title: Practical Ethics - Laura Thomson (Mozilla)
Publication date: 2018-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Data leaks. Life-altering decisions made by algorithm. Voter manipulation.  In this environment, ethics take on a role that wasn’t previously so critical in computing. As engineers, not ethicists, how should we proceed? Nothing is ever as simple in practice as it seems in theory. In this keynote, I will cover the approach we have developed at Mozilla toward data ethics, review, and stewardship, including practical open source guidelines for lean data, and examples of when we’ve gotten it right and wrong.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
I could get up here give a talk called

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,940
how to be tough perfect and we've all

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,680
seen this talk at many tech conferences

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,719
right probably seen it a couple of times

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,880
this week where someone gets up and says

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,080
this is the you know the platonic form

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,000
of architecture that we have at my

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,440
company and it runs smoothly and

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,150
everything is beautiful and when things

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,220
break we all you know group hug and

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,660
there is no blame and we move on I

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,010
usually you walk away feeling inspired

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,230
but also kind of overwhelmed like I

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,750
can't do these things at my company and

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,189
that's not my goal here so this talk is

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,800
not how to be perfect

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,239
it's about practical ethics so I'm just

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,450
going to tell you about what it is that

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,969
we do is data and experimentation how we

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,710
have messed up and how we try to fix it

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,030
or we've messed up so all of us are

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,649
going to mess up at some point all right

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,270
this is important to know and Mozilla

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,399
we've put a lot of work into trying to

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,690
do these things in an ethical way but

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,120
that doesn't mean we always get it right

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,320
part of ethics is admitting when you

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,270
mess it up and fixing it so I'll begin

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,620
with some standard disclaimers I'm just

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,390
gonna talk about what we do is ID not

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,220
claiming it's perfect the thing to note

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,200
is that this approach is open-source all

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,420
of our documentation is on public wiki's

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,820
and in github repos or mercurial repos

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,909
but this is all in github repos so you

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,540
can steal it your own make it better for

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,460
kit

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,619
give us your feedback pull requests

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,299
welcome that is not a cop-out okay so

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,250
here are the basic principles if you

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,229
want one slide from this whole talk this

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,759
is probably the most important one we

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,820
use a collection of what we call lean

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,460
data practices three things first

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,720
collect only what you need specifically

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,759
collect what you need to answer the

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,259
questions that you have

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,579
second of all keep that data for the

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,710
minimum amount of time that you need it

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,689
and third of all try really really hard

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,979
not to violate your user expectations

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,540
okay simple right

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,250
we begin by classifying data into four

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,049
basic classes and these are things that

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,610
an engineer a data scientist or market I

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,259
might want to collect and they are

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,430
ordered from less problematic

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,680
to more contentious the first set of

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,360
things is technical data and this is you

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
know I think nobody in this room is

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,390
going to argue with me that it's kind of

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,160
important to know things like what

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,850
version of the software I use is running

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,260
what operating systems they

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,180
of how much memory do they have on the

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,770
machine this is opt-out you can actually

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,020
turn off us collecting this data but

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,170
it's really you know generally speaking

00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,780
not very contentious second category is

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,570
interaction data slightly more invasive

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,010
but really not very much so how much the

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,800
average number of tabs that people have

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,240
how long do they use Firefox for what

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,760
are they conflict settings set to do

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,980
people turn things off and on does

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,180
anyone use bookmarks anymore right and

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,880
these are things that are mostly

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,750
interesting in terms of the distribution

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,970
so what are the means one of the

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,850
distributions you know we learn things

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,870
all the time and in general nobody's

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,340
gonna argue with you if you want to

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,470
collect this kind of data it's uptown

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,900
again you can turn it off but most

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,250
people aren't really going to care then

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,960
somewhere in between category 2 and

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,070
category 3 there is this giant dotted

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,900
line where it gets much stickier the

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,000
third category of things is web activity

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,370
data so the chief example here is

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,440
browsing history these are the URLs that

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:16,150
you visit and honestly most people don't

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,560
want these collected right browsing

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,970
history is a minefield for all kinds of

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,950
reasons especially if you pair it with

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,660
any kind of identifying information if

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,880
you are old enough which I am you may

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,610
remember AOL releasing a whole bunch of

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,960
web logs and they were anonymized right

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,390
and one of most is one of the scariest

00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,700
words in the English language and it was

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,590
pretty possible to extract you know who

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,150
was who had done what and which teachers

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,080
were looking at things on the web on the

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,610
internet that they shouldn't be looking

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,040
at there was all sorts of stuff about it

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,690
a non webby example that's pretty

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,300
similar activity data in general is

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,770
scary right people remember the uber

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,180
trip logs coming out and it was pretty

00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,230
easy to reconstruct from those where

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,350
somebody might live and what their

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:56,140
patterns of activity were so even beyond

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,970
that URLs can be non item potent for all

00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,350
we say you know everything should be

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,390
atom potent but you can visit something

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,400
and change somebody's data and they also

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,500
often contain user names passwords and

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,080
emails which are worse again than you

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,700
are ELLs having said that we do

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,650
sometimes collect them there has to be a

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,000
really good reason and that always has

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,250
to be opted out and has to be some kind

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,739
of mitigation in place I'll give you

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,850
some examples in a little while the

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,650
fourth category is stuff that we

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,580
basically don't collect it's highly

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,800
sensitive data

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,990
so things that are identifying email

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,860
username not just

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,660
personally I didn't find but generally

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,100
identifying but in general you should

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,220
assume at Mozilla that you can't collect

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,920
these right we do in one case right

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,600
it's opt-in with advance notice user

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,600
consent and secondary update

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,970
