Title: Practical Ethics - Laura Thomson (Mozilla)
Publication date: 2018-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Data leaks. Life-altering decisions made by algorithm. Voter manipulation.  In this environment, ethics take on a role that wasn’t previously so critical in computing. As engineers, not ethicists, how should we proceed? Nothing is ever as simple in practice as it seems in theory. In this keynote, I will cover the approach we have developed at Mozilla toward data ethics, review, and stewardship, including practical open source guidelines for lean data, and examples of when we’ve gotten it right and wrong.
