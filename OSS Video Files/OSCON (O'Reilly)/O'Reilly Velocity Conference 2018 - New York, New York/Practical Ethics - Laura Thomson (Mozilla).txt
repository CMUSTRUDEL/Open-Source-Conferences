Title: Practical Ethics - Laura Thomson (Mozilla)
Publication date: 2018-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Data leaks. Life-altering decisions made by algorithm. Voter manipulation.  In this environment, ethics take on a role that wasnâ€™t previously so critical in computing. As engineers, not ethicists, how should we proceed? Nothing is ever as simple in practice as it seems in theory. In this keynote, I will cover the approach we have developed at Mozilla toward data ethics, review, and stewardship, including practical open source guidelines for lean data, and examples of when weâ€™ve gotten it right and wrong.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
I could get up here give a talk called

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,940
how to be tough perfect and we've all

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,680
seen this talk at many tech conferences

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,719
right probably seen it a couple of times

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,880
this week where someone gets up and says

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,080
this is the you know the platonic form

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,000
of architecture that we have at my

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,440
company and it runs smoothly and

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,150
everything is beautiful and when things

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,220
break we all you know group hug and

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,660
there is no blame and we move on I

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,010
usually you walk away feeling inspired

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,230
but also kind of overwhelmed like I

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,750
can't do these things at my company and

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,189
that's not my goal here so this talk is

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,800
not how to be perfect

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,239
it's about practical ethics so I'm just

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,450
going to tell you about what it is that

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,969
we do is data and experimentation how we

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,710
have messed up and how we try to fix it

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,030
or we've messed up so all of us are

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,649
going to mess up at some point all right

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,270
this is important to know and Mozilla

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,399
we've put a lot of work into trying to

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,690
do these things in an ethical way but

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,120
that doesn't mean we always get it right

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,320
part of ethics is admitting when you

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,270
mess it up and fixing it so I'll begin

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,620
with some standard disclaimers I'm just

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,390
gonna talk about what we do is ID not

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,220
claiming it's perfect the thing to note

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,200
is that this approach is open-source all

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,420
of our documentation is on public wiki's

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,820
and in github repos or mercurial repos

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,909
but this is all in github repos so you

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,540
can steal it your own make it better for

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,460
kit

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,619
give us your feedback pull requests

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,299
welcome that is not a cop-out okay so

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,250
here are the basic principles if you

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,229
want one slide from this whole talk this

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,759
is probably the most important one we

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,820
use a collection of what we call lean

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,460
data practices three things first

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,720
collect only what you need specifically

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,759
collect what you need to answer the

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,259
questions that you have

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,579
second of all keep that data for the

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,710
minimum amount of time that you need it

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,689
and third of all try really really hard

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,979
not to violate your user expectations

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,540
okay simple right

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,250
we begin by classifying data into four

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,049
basic classes and these are things that

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,610
an engineer a data scientist or market I

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,259
might want to collect and they are

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,430
ordered from less problematic

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,680
to more contentious the first set of

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,360
things is technical data and this is you

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
know I think nobody in this room is

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,390
going to argue with me that it's kind of

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,160
important to know things like what

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,850
version of the software I use is running

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,260
what operating systems they

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,180
of how much memory do they have on the

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,770
machine this is opt-out you can actually

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,020
turn off us collecting this data but

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,170
it's really you know generally speaking

00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,780
not very contentious second category is

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,570
interaction data slightly more invasive

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,010
but really not very much so how much the

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,800
average number of tabs that people have

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,240
how long do they use Firefox for what

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,760
are they conflict settings set to do

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,980
people turn things off and on does

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,180
anyone use bookmarks anymore right and

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,880
these are things that are mostly

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,750
interesting in terms of the distribution

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,970
so what are the means one of the

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,850
distributions you know we learn things

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,870
all the time and in general nobody's

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,340
gonna argue with you if you want to

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,470
collect this kind of data it's uptown

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,900
again you can turn it off but most

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,250
people aren't really going to care then

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,960
somewhere in between category 2 and

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,070
category 3 there is this giant dotted

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,900
line where it gets much stickier the

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,000
third category of things is web activity

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,370
data so the chief example here is

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,440
browsing history these are the URLs that

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:16,150
you visit and honestly most people don't

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,560
want these collected right browsing

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,970
history is a minefield for all kinds of

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,950
reasons especially if you pair it with

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,660
any kind of identifying information if

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,880
you are old enough which I am you may

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,610
remember AOL releasing a whole bunch of

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,960
web logs and they were anonymized right

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,390
and one of most is one of the scariest

00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,700
words in the English language and it was

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,590
pretty possible to extract you know who

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,150
was who had done what and which teachers

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,080
were looking at things on the web on the

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,610
internet that they shouldn't be looking

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,040
at there was all sorts of stuff about it

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,690
a non webby example that's pretty

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,300
similar activity data in general is

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,770
scary right people remember the uber

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,180
trip logs coming out and it was pretty

00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,230
easy to reconstruct from those where

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,350
somebody might live and what their

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:56,140
patterns of activity were so even beyond

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,970
that URLs can be non item potent for all

00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,350
we say you know everything should be

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,390
atom potent but you can visit something

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,400
and change somebody's data and they also

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,500
often contain user names passwords and

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,080
emails which are worse again than you

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,700
are ELLs having said that we do

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,650
sometimes collect them there has to be a

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,000
really good reason and that always has

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,250
to be opted out and has to be some kind

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,739
of mitigation in place I'll give you

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,850
some examples in a little while the

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,650
fourth category is stuff that we

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,580
basically don't collect it's highly

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,800
sensitive data

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,990
so things that are identifying email

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,860
username not just

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,660
personally I didn't find but generally

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,100
identifying but in general you should

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,220
assume at Mozilla that you can't collect

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,920
these right we do in one case right

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,600
it's opt-in with advance notice user

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,600
consent and secondary update

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,970
