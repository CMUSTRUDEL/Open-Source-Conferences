and what comes down to is a fundamental

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,649
question for all the systems we build of

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,000
who's allowed to create who's allowed to

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,370
take something and put it in front of

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,630
people in front of the world and are we

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,680
setting those boundaries in the right

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,510
place or is our fear about risk pushing

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,359
us to feel like maybe we should be more

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,710
cautious and this is a real personal

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,930
question for me because it made me

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,160
confront the question of what if the

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,050
problem is me so I'd introduce myself I

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,669
said I'm a neo - from the internet but I

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,020
actually am is I'm I'm I'm from a

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,590
company called glitch I'm the CEO of

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,360
glitch but a lot of you might know us

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,420
better with our old name which was fog

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,100
Creek software we'd the team and created

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,539
Stack Overflow a co-created Stack

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,520
Overflow and created Trello and spun

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,870
them out and pretty much all of you I'm

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,129
sure familiar with a lot of the tools

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,649
and the legacy in the history of the

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,469
company and those were big shoes to fill

00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:56,489
when I came in and you know one of the

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,320
things I reckoned with it was culture

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,039
change and this came up in a real

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,589
specific way we had a great team member

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,140
who works with us and she oversees a lot

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,850
around culture and operations and one of

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,260
the parts of that is recruiting we're in

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,939
the midst of you know updating our

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,380
recruiting like I think everybody is to

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,750
be more inclusive and bring more people

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,130
in and we had a part of the process that

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,780
was like a little survey and we had to

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,090
there's a little business logic behind

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,650
it we had to build a little app in order

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,659
to gather the survey data around our

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,270
recruiting process and I had a

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,040
conversation with her about I wanted to

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,810
change some of the copy simple change I

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
don't think the language is right and

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,049
she's a great idea she's like oh we're

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,970
gonna make these updates and these

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,409
changes and you know we have this larger

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,840
goal that we're doing where I think by

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,560
early next year across our company we're

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,729
going to be pretty balanced on gender

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,799
identities for pretty much everybody in

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,149
the company we were getting to 50/50

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,799
between men and people who are not men

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,180
across the organization and we're pretty

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,329
excited about that but it takes a lot of

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,219
work and so you know we talked through

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,740
how we're gonna update this this part of

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,829
the the app tip that people go into and

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,860
at the end of the conversation I said to

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,590
her to my colleague can you have one of

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,090
the devs update that and then push you

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,720
to production so we can you know have

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,980
those changes go live and the tool that

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,780
we run that we built

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,489
that we renamed a company after called

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,000
glitch is a tool that lets anybody edit

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,909
and update apps and share them and she

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,680
said oh I already did it its life like

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,909
why we were talking I just went in there

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,330
and changed it did it that's what the

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,500
tool enables I hadn't thought of that as

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,000
a CEO or the company that makes the

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,000
products that they would enable somebody

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,879
to do that and I hadn't thought about my

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,250
own assumptions about who was allowed to

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,390
ship something and who was allowed to

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,590
put something out in the world and who

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,110
had permission and it was a revelation

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,849
to me it was a bit of an epiphany about

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,260
the learning I had to do about the way I

00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,760
had to change my own attitude about

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,650
something I profess to care about

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,450
coworker I have tremendous respect for a

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,329
tool that I obviously believe in I bet

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,400
my career on it and yet I hadn't put the

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,200
pieces together about what does it mean

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,959
when we actually empower people to be

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,120
able to put their work out in the world

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,010
and we trust them now you have to build

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,849
the right systems right you have to be

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,930
able to roll the heck you have to be

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,540
able to do all the other things that are

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,500
there but to take somebody whose role or

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,180
title or place in the org chart wasn't

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,549
designated to have that permission

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,470
before and then to say what if we leave

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,959
our values and how we build this system

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,099
and how we build this technology and we

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,720
actually empower somebody to put

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,620
something out there and by the end of

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,690
that conversation

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,650
something was visible to the world had

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,650
already been updated

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,430
