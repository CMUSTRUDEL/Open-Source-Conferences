Description: 
	SRE has exploded in the industry over the last two years with the publication of two bestselling books from Google. Not surprisingly, there have been questions about how SRE and DevOps relate. Do they compete? Do they re-inforce? The short answer is that they make each other better. In this talk, come hear why.

my name is Dave I'm an engineering

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,819
director at Google in our sre site

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,720
reliability engineering organization

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,309
quick show of hands

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,290
who's heard of sre I love doing that you

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,460
know two or three years ago when I'd go

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,289
to conferences and talk to people and

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,570
say who's sort of sre it would be

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,060
crickets and it's been slowly building

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,279
over time which is kind of neat and so I

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,119
get asked a lot we all do get asked a

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,070
lot okay so if a sari is how Google does

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,320
Production Engineering it's scale and it

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,559
is how does that relate to DevOps

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,390
because obviously in the age of Twitter

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,879
Wars they must fight with one another

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,950
right and no actually they don't they

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,800
reinforce one another in fact my

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,820
colleagues Liz Fong Jones on front there

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,280
she is

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,230
and Seth Fargo did an awesome series on

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,700
YouTube comparing contrasting and talk

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,530
about how they reinforce one another oh

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,629
I should mention I have to go pretty

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,489
quickly I have like 108 slides to do in

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,050
five minutes no actually I don't have

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,899
any I don't have any slides at all

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,840
because I'm an engineer and I'm terrible

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,489
at slice and I would strongly prefer you

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,380
not spend the five minutes I'm on stage

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,630
going Wow you know you don't need size

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,070
for any of this stuff anyway so there's

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,720
a great series on YouTube that listen

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,909
Seth did that goes into a lot of details

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,200
but I want to cover a few important

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,560
things here because I think there's a

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,290
key message for us to deliver all right

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,659
yes it is true that both essary and

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,610
DevOps developed roughly independently

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,280
independently ish of one another kind of

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,990
in their early to mid-2000s one you know

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,990
in the case of sre almost you know

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,280
inside at Google in response to our

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,189
production growth and challenges and

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,259
DevOps of course in a very open way with

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,729
a large community outside but

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,740
interesting enough they landed in in

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,200
roughly the same place like a very

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,659
common set of principles about breaking

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,540
down silos and monitoring all the

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,329
important things and reasoning from your

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,210
user's perspective first and accepting

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,549
that some failure is inevitable right

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,799
those are basic principles of DevOps I

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,140
guess well the basic principles of sre -

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,440
so an easy way to think about this is

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,510
that sree is a very opinionated it's

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,950
super opinionated concrete

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,560
implementation

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,120
of DevOps principles all right and so

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,459
when you're reading you know the

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,250
original sre book anyone here read the

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,470
original essary book awesome I'm gonna

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,780
push my luck and they would even seen or

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,940
aware that its companion volume the site

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,770
reliability workbook is that oh well who

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,080
more hands that's even that's why it's

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,819
come does my heart good we only released

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,989
it like last month I'm so you're eating

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,670
those things right that's kind of the

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,430
takeaways oh I got it this is a very

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,600
specific roadmap that when I'm done it's

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,700
going to give me a thing that looks like

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,640
a very definite kind of implementation

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,200
of DevOps now I want to talk about just

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,870
a couple of key principles here that I

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,640
think everyone should keep in their head

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,769
number one the most important feature of

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,730
your system probably does not appear in

00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,519
your PRDS

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,860
or your descriptions it's your

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,030
reliability reliability is the single

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,500
most important feature of your system

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,840
period and I can prove this pretty

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,310
easily if your system is not reliable

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,110
that is to say it does not consistently

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,310
meet your users expectations it's not

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,200
available when they needed to be here

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,819
it's giving the mayor's or so forth they

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,100
will not trust it if they do not trust

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,170
it they will not use it if they do not

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,959
use it you will have a very expensive

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,519
system with no users do you know what

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,590
there is not in the whole wide world and

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,549
this wonderful incredible world of

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,500
nature where we have unbelievable

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,829
diversity of everything there is no such

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,090
thing as a very valuable system with no

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:38,160
users it does not exist there are from

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,230
time to time very valuable systems that

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,510
don't get much use nuclear control

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,190
systems would be a good example the air

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,140
bags in your car would be a great

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,640
example by the way if the air bags of

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,290
your in your car are getting

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,030
consistently used you should consider

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,410
public transportation so reliability is

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,410
the most important feature because it's

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,810
the basis of user trust which leads to

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,329
the next thing which is if that is true

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,030
and it is then the only measure of

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,130
reliability that matters is from your

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,780
users perspective your users will never

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,310
call you and say it's not working for me

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,829
and you say but my monitoring looks good

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,950
and they say oh never mind

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:19,620
that will never happen to you the last

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,320
thing I want to give you take away here

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,750
in our last few seconds it's giving

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,180
yourself a break many of us in our

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,750
careers have labored under conditions

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,030
that require

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,830
to be perfect a hundred percent customer

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,730
satisfaction a hundred percent uptime

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,590
zero errors these are bad goals they're

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,480
counterproductive goals and they will

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,060
eventually turn your honest wonderful

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,130
employees into liars because when they

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,990
reach the set of goals they can actually

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,450
achieve but you're measuring them beyond

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,880
that you'll force them to fudge metrics

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,530
Liz and I are gonna have a talk later at

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,360
11:30 I think in the Murray Hill

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,180
ballroom where we're gonna go into a lot

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,340
more depth about this and actually how

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,960
you can take these principles and really

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,250
implement in your organization and even

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,870
if you're in a very large enterprise

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,690
that these are actually very friendly to

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,730
the things you are doing now but for now

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,770
I am Dave it has been a joy to spend

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,670
five minutes with you and thank you very

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,859
much

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,859
[Applause]

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,900
