Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	The programmer’s mind is inherently an activist’s mind. Jessica McKellar draws parallels between the free and open source software movement and the work to end mass incarceration.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,919
yeah so I'm really into Python but but I

00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:09,410
have a secret to share with you all

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,150
actually shout out back to the nil sock

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:16,710
the secret is that all of this effort

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,390
was never actually about Python love the

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,380
language like love you guys

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:25,310
but it was always about systems and what

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,109
I mean by that is I believe this thing

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,970
really firmly like this is like the most

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,550
fundamental thing and I believe these

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,469
days which is that programming changes

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,950
the way that you think about in debug

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,450
and interact with the world when you

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,370
learn how to program and those things

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,829
happen to you that's a pretty profound

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,870
thing so when you learn how to program

00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,239
you learn a set of rules you become

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,809
fluent in those rules you become

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,180
hopefully a systematic debugger within

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,219
those rules you learn to work with other

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,859
people to break down and solve problems

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,110
to build software to build libraries to

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,990
change the language and the ecosystem to

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,490
make it better and so you learn a bunch

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,630
of rules and then you learn that you can

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,479
change your environment you learn that

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,130
you can change the rules so really

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,340
programmers master assists and that they

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,080
know that they can change when you learn

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,210
how to program you have this opportunity

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,610
to experience this and it's actually

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,990
worth reflecting on why how did that

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,939
even come to be a thing that exists in

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,890
this world and like actually we should

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,119
give some credit back to the early days

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,740
of the free software movement cuz the

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,979
tenants of free software give us

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,409
explicit permission to do this if we

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,210
remind ourselves what these are this is

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,700
like we should be able to run programs

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,649
however we want to for why ever we want

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,530
to we should have little look at a code

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,270
and understand it and change it we

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,899
should we'll just share it back out like

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,490
share useful changes to the world and

00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:58,110
the tenets of free software are so baked

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,000
into an integral to open-source

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,829
communities today I think we sometimes

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,719
take for granted what a powerful

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,970
collective mindset this is like do we

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,920
think this about the way that other

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,450
interactions in our life work that we

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,880
should be able to change them make them

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,220
better

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,050
together and when we take it for granted

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,000
we can sometimes forget to challenge

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,340
ourselves to carry this powerful mindset

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,400
into our lives outside of open source

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,120
communities so sure programming has

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,740
rules and you can change the rules but

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,290
really almost everything is a system

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,450
with rules spoken or otherwise that you

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,010
have the power to change like everything

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,770
important like everything that worth

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,060
that is worth fighting for is a system

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,550
even if nobody told you the rules so

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,400
that you could change them and there are

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,820
software systems and there are hardware

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,800
systems and the most important systems

00:02:48,820 --> 00:03:00,250
in my opinion at least are people's

00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:02,680
systems and you know this this like this

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,030
is why I teach people to program like

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,070
this is why I invest so much of my time

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,900
in my life into enabling other people

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,700
learn how to program inside and outside

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,880
the Python community because of this

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,380
belief because programmers master of

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,110
systems that they know that they can

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,640
change and when you've done it once you

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,860
maybe believe that you can do it again

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,510
in other contexts and we need as many

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,650
people as possible on the planet who

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,650
believe this about themselves

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,560
