Publication date: 2018-10-02
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Machine Learning has revolutionized many fields, from cancer detection to self-driving cars, not forgetting about connected toilets that allow Alexa to flush at your command. This talk will cover some of the techniques used and mention the most relevant research, but especially concentrate on use cases where Machine Learning can help developers be more efficient.

	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,230
so let's talk about machine learning on

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,910
source code what is machine learning on

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,540
source code well it is machine learning

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,880
that you apply on source code the input

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,860
is source code that is the main thing

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,949
it's rather learning from images or

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,010
natural tags or videos or whatever we're

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,619
learning from source code itself and

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,060
other than that is actually not that

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:25,590
revolutionary and there's actually many

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,689
fields that are very very heavily

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,929
related to this you can think for

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,540
instance about data mining we have many

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,250
repositories across all of the possible

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,570
servers get service to behave around the

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,670
world right like wait you have a patch

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,930
of nation but also kid hub there's so

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,690
many other places where you can store

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,030
code so there's a lot of data in that

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,309
data needs to be put together unified

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,170
clean all of these things are things

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,329
that are no new people have been doing

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,160
this for quite a while and data mining

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,620
has a lot of techniques that we use in a

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,230
mountain code in a similar way natural

00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,520
language processing the skills from

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,039
natural language processing actually

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,110
apply really well to what we do there's

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,119
a lot of common aspects in between

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,270
understanding code and understanding

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,189
human language the main difference is

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,860
that when you're learning when you're

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,930
understanding human language you're

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,970
quite easily you're able to reproduce

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,880
some of that human language because it's

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,700
very flexible if you create a sentence

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,290
that brings a little bit weird but

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,119
people still understand you you're fine

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,770
right like I'm able to be on stage and

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,299
I'm sure that most of the words that I'm

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,060
saying are correct but not all of them

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,740
and the message still goes well if you

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,960
do that with code if you generate source

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,299
code that is almost correct but not

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,100
quite it's just not correct right it

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,170
just doesn't compile so even though it's

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,329
similar techniques they actually apply

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,369
in a completely different way and then

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,619
finally there's the paragraph based

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,060
machine learning that I just had to make

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,649
you make sure that you understand that

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,299
this is not easy there's a lot of really

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,990
fancy maths that we're gonna avoid

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,430
completely today what does what do you

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,799
need to do machine learning source code

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,000
source code lots of it like really

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,880
really lots of it

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,799
we have data sets that contain like all

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,200
of the repositories on github and we

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,599
analyze those right and that is not in

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,650
enough code because even if you analyze

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,030
all of the current github

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,739
a lot of code that is outside that

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,709
you've never seen so you need as much

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,180
code as possible then fancier fancy

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,670
machine learning algorithms which I'll

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,409
mention a little bit and then a little

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,510
bit of luck there's a lot of statistics

00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,430
here which means that something things

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,019
work sometimes they're done you know

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,180
exactly how often that happens though

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,500
which is good but that still means that

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,569
sometimes the predictions you will do

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,280
will will not be correct and you need to

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,019
deal with that and prefer when you're

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,400
preparing a product you need to deal

00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,670
with the fact that your product will be

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,670
wrong

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,959
