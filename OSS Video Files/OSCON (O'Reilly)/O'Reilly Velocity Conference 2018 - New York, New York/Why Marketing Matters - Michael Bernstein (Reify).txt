Title: Why Marketing Matters - Michael Bernstein (Reify)
Publication date: 2018-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	For many Open Source developers, Marketing can seem like a scam — pushing terrible software with one mouth while ruining good software with the other. As a open source software developer turned marketing consultant, I have just enough experience and empathy for both points of view. In this talk, we’ll take an unflinching look at some of the fallacies that developers believe about marketing. Together we’ll learn to develop empathy for the folks doing the hard work of marketing software, learn the impact of personas and messaging on the quality of software itself, and finally learn the connection between Tin Pan Alley and software marketing.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
so the big hypothesis here is this more

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,120
and better marketing will lead to more

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,860
and better adoption then stated

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,040
differently you know the time that you

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,049
spend upfront caring about your audience

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,640
the value you're providing to your

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,470
audience the message that you're using

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,029
to communicate that value the more you

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,420
do that upfront and consider that

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,269
upfront the less time you waste the more

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,560
successful you'll be and the more people

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,840
you'll be able to help with your

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,899
whatever fabulous awesomeness you're

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,430
writing code for right now and so I want

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,410
us all to improve that marketing get

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,690
better at it so that we can get more

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,930
adoption right I'm gonna help you

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,390
improve right now today but before we

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,070
before I help you improve it your

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,230
ability to do marketing understand the

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,850
foundational elements of it I really

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,620
want to spend a little bit of time

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,910
talking about the fact that you really

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,579
need to appreciate it

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,500
believe in it before you get better at

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,329
it it's not just a thing you can do in

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,219
your spare time you're not just gonna

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,600
get better at it because you say one day

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,180
a this is the thing I'm gonna get better

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,610
at you know it's like anything any other

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,909
technical skill that you learn it's like

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,860
testing or security or you know learning

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,020
whatever right you have to do it with

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,150
intention you have to care about it and

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,830
believe in it and in order to appreciate

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,360
it I just want you to understand it a

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,900
little bit better so I'm going to spend

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,479
this much time on understanding what is

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,040
what is marketing right you know when I

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,180
tell you go do some marketing right what

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,829
are you supposed to do what are you

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,259
supposed to think about what does

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,460
marketing really mean and I'm just the

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,750
kind of person you know when I when I

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,740
want to know what a word means I like to

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,689
just you know stare at it right and

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,280
marketing is a word where I kind of like

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,759
it cuz you know what is it it's right

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,030
there in the word right you're marketing

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,159
the thing right you're getting it ready

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,930
for the market you're doing all the

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,210
things besides coding and operating

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,619
you're just you know you're talking

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,740
about it you're communicating about it

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,890
you're considering it in a larger

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,540
context so the other thing that I heard

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,399
about keynotes besides the big like

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,869
provocative statement thing is like you

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,130
have to have a parable so here's my

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,800
parable it's about farming

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,650
vegetables and fruits so I want everyone

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,470
in here to close your eyes right let the

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,030
world of computers melt away and imagine

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,620
that you're a farmer right this is

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,940
exactly how farming works I'm gonna

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,610
break it down for you in case you don't

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,850
know okay here's how farming works step

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,550
one you get some land right step two you

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,350
get some seeds step three you get some

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,750
water that's free that's good right so

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,960
you take the land you prepare it you

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,030
plant the seeds you grow the plants you

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,700
tend to them you watch them grow

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,100
you fight bugs and molds and all these

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,670
things and then when all of the fruit is

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,670
ready on the field you just sit there

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,030
right and you just wait right for people

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,580
to come to your field and eat your fruit

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,060
right or to buy it off you that's

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,160
exactly how farming works trust me I

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:12,530
live in the south right so obviously

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,820
that's not how farming works you'll end

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,690
up with a lot of heartache and rotten

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,370
fruit and that doesn't smell good right

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,370
that's not how farming works that's not

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:27,140
how software works either right if you

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:29,390
build it they won't come right unless

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,770
you tell them about it right so how do

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,390
you tell them about it that's what

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,490
marketing is right bringing it to market

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,030
doing all of the things besides growing

00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,200
the fruit you know fixing your tires and

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,240
looking up on Google Maps how to get

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,209
there all that stuff right

00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,620
here's a list a non-exhaustive list of

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,820
things that my partner and I came up

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,990
with we were chatting I said you know

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,360
what are what are some of the things I

00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,670
can throw up on the screen just some of

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,800
the activities some of the things the

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,440
ideas the concepts that are involved in

00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,240
marketing a product to get adoption you

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,510
know coding isn't on here right this is

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,740
supposed to be all of the other stuff

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,200
you know and the thing that I want you

00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,150
to understand and appreciate is that if

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,790
we never did any of these things no one

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,230
would use our software right that's one

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,200
thing another thing is that this is a

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,450
lot of work right it's considerably more

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,700
work in my opinion in aggregate than

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,380
than writing the code right a simple

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,790
matter of programming is a simple matter

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,470
of programming this is the hard stuff

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,030
this is all of the stuff that makes

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,030
people want to use your software

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,240
