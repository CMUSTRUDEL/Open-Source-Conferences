Publication date: 2018-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2018 - New York, New York
Description: 
	For many Open Source developers, Marketing can seem like a scam — pushing terrible software with one mouth while ruining good software with the other. As a open source software developer turned marketing consultant, I have just enough experience and empathy for both points of view. In this talk, we’ll take an unflinching look at some of the fallacies that developers believe about marketing. Together we’ll learn to develop empathy for the folks doing the hard work of marketing software, learn the impact of personas and messaging on the quality of software itself, and finally learn the connection between Tin Pan Alley and software marketing.
