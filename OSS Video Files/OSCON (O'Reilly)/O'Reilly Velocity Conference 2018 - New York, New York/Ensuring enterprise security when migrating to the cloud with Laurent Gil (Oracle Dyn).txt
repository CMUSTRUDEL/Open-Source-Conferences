I'm Roger Margolis here velocity New

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,569
York 2018 I'm here with Lauren Gill who

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,360
is the senior product architect for

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,170
internet security at Oracle welcome

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,940
thank you

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,099
nice to meet you I happen to have lots

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,020
of meetup you did last night and it was

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,740
it's very informative I really liked

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,109
clever ways that you guys use algorithms

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,300
to figure out what's going on so as we

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,060
know that cloud has really changed a lot

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,390
of things we see it as a topic that's

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,759
really changing even on our platform and

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,070
O'Reilly how do you see the cloud

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,739
computing developing and Oracle's role

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,309
in it yes that's a very good question

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,600
it's it's a fascinating industry you

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,520
know it's very strange so a lot of

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,379
people talk about club for a number of

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,480
years now and as you know there are very

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,690
good players in that place and some

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,930
dominant in the space as well and we're

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,710
probably one of the last one to go in

00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,059
here's what we found

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,039
you see Oracle is a company that I

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,019
studies focusing very heavily into the

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,040
large enterprises that's where we are

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,570
famous for we have very large enterprise

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,570
solutions and we see a lot of our

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,040
customers that are still not yet moving

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,170
to the cloud it's a very interesting

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,330
things where they are still concerns

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,600
about it and we have this Angad Oracle

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,060
some of these tools that make them want

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,000
or ease the migration into the core into

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,770
the cloud one of these tools we have

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,960
designed and was actually one of the

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,140
company that Oracle bought which was my

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
company are designed to ensure that the

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,369
migration to the cloud is fully secured

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,950
so you are secure before your secret

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,659
after security is probably one of the

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,759
number-one concern for lausanne

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,079
surprises and as they are thinking of

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,049
moving to the cloud they suddenly

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,909
realize or all the security gears and

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,619
appliances they were using before you

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,850
can actually move them to the cloud

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,570
these are appliances right they're

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,920
machines

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,020
there's a little harder to move the

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,420
machines into the car but also it means

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,880
that you have some new ways of thinking

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,400
about security cloud-based security

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,130
systems that

00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,440
is that transition and for some of these

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,480
enterprises so these are kind of the new

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,950
things and that's why security is always

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,110
the number one concerns when that

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:22,520
happened so what makes for a secure

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:25,190
cloud first what makes a sec applaud is

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,560
to ensure that you can secure just not

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,500
one cloud but all the clouds that the

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,900
enterprise used including the these

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,290
assets that they still have on Prem

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,450
inside their own data center so the the

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,420
way we see security on the cloud is a

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:45,470
platform that is fully agnostic to where

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,530
these assets are located whether they

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,930
are located in Oracle cloud or they are

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,080
located in AWS or in Google cloud or in

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,000
Azure or in the on Prem of the data

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,430
center of that customer and so we have

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,530
this and these a lot of these security

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,810
layers and security platform especially

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,970
for applications and DDoS and all of

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,580
these things that are fully at Gnostic

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:12,260
to this therefore these security systems

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,900
can follow the enterprise's as they are

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,570
moving to a cloud solution as they are

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,630
moving to our as they are moving to

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,970
others as well with the similar tools

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,950
that are the same regardless of the

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,989
cloud solution they use so we're seeing

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,910
a lot of trends around this mmm-hmm

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,010
given that I know a lot of companies are

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,790
concerned about that migration you know

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,140
what steps can they take to ensure oh

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,320
yeah we have a lot of stories around

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:43,070
this so here is what we usually advise

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,130
to a company take a solution that is

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,100
agnostic to where you're hosting new

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,440
assets so let's let's say the company

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,810
has on Prem applications they're moving

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,850
the workload we call this lift and shift

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,480
they are lifting this into a cloud

00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,690
solution

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,840
let's put first a security platform on

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,610
their old infrastructure and a security

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,160
platform that is fully agnostic to where

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,340
this is located as they are moving from

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,620
the old location to the Oracle cloud or

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,959
to a cloud of our competitor the

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,940
security platform is the same because

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,299
you see it was activated on the old

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,280
thing

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,769
and because it's independent to where

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,169
this is located as they are moving the

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,110
old things to the new things the

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,150
security layers is the same and so this

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,590
by doing this you fully the risk I don't

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,020
like the word the risk let's say you

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,110
help the migration by at least taking

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,449
the security out of the of the equation

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,909
of the migration right you're securing

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:44,150
first with modern tools that are cloud

00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:45,860
based on the old things and as you're

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,460
moving to the new things to security to

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,349
sing great with sitting it makes the

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,969
analogy of changing your tires while

00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:57,440
going 60 miles an hour yeah that yes

00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:59,539
would you do you have four tires

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,340
you're changing one as you're you're not

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,530
changing for them at the same time you

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,210
start by the first and you do the second

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,169
you do that that's that's how we say

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,379
things okay

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,270
now I've heard you talk about edge

00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,039
security and that seems pretty

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,080
intriguing because we think of the edge

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,110
is a really important part that not

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,789
enough people talk about so here's why

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,479
we call it edge security

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:26,569
the reason is edge security means we are

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,300
monitoring and mitigating attacks on our

00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:31,310
company's customers assets a very far

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,289
away from where these assets are located

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,719
that's why it's called the edge we are

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:38,240
doing as security we are protecting our

00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:40,969
customers at the edge before these

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,669
attacks goes into the assets of our

00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:45,860
clients and for this week we have a

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,779
number of techniques we use application

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,879
security so it's also called Web

00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:52,490
Application Firewall you may have heard

00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,940
these words pop management so the idea

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,560
here is how do you identify whether a

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,440
request that come in to an application

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,270
is from a human or from a bot and is it

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,340
a good bottle bad bot so there's a lot

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,319
of classifiers there's a lot of machine

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,300
learning techniques that are classifying

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,669
these requests into these buckets we

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,580
have a new one that we are talking this

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:16,340
show about API security the this the

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,099
idea is the same call into an API and

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,319
API call is it coming from a malicious

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,300
user is it coming from your mobile

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,099
device and if it's from your mobile

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,080
device you want to go in if it's from a

00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,040
malicious user you obviously will block

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,170
this at the

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,600
edge of the network and finally DDoS

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,030
protection is a similar idea it's any

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,840
any garbage traffic coming in at a very

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,430
high rate would be block at the edge

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,190
before this garbage traffic if you wish

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:46,730
go and reach the origin go and reach

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,290
your data center or data center great

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,970
now you've mentioned BOTS a few times

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,860
and at your talk last night you talked a

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,740
lot about what's going on are they

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,110
really a problem and how do companies go

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,970
about that okay so I'm gonna give you an

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,100
example we have a lot of but I'm gonna

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,740
give you an example that is similar to

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,440
one I gave last night the customer verse

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,240
is an airline in Southeast Asia so they

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,640
fly between Singapore Hong Kong and a

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,180
few others here is what they noticed

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,830
suddenly before they came to us and then

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,560
they came to us at the time suddenly

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,110
they started to receive a lot of tickets

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,730
from Chinese clients much more than

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,100
usual let's say they had some because

00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,870
Hong Kong is in China but much more than

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,660
usual and then they notice for some

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,050
weird reasons a vast majority of these

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,190
tickets were automatically cancelled

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,340
automatically means someone were

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,880
cancelling these tickets 20 just 24

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,070
hours before 24 hours after the booking

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,900
and Ellen's like to do this thank you

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,580
full refund if you cancel within 24

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,670
hours so what happened is the following

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,820
plans gets full by having a lot of

00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:55,460
tickets being booked from Chinese

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,160
customers and then just a little bit

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,080
less than 24 hours after the purchasing

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,790
of the tickets these tickets were

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,390
cancelled automatically they were using

00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:07,760
weird credit cards these were not humans

00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,610
there were bots that would book plane

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,560
tickets they will make the plane full it

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,230
means in yield management that the price

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,930
of the remaining seats would increase

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:20,230
the day after everything is canceled who

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,070
is benefiting from this the competition

00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,450
because their tickets were not

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,080
increasing because their plane were not

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,090
getting full

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,220
so we suspect some full player almost

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,640
criminal of fraudulent let's say in

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,729
nature by having with we suspect some of

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,260
the competition of that airline

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,060
artificially buying tickets and

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,570
canceling

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:43,479
with full refund to generate an increase

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,250
of pricing and this was obviously from

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,530
BOTS and we actually we know who they

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,570
are they know who we are it's this kind

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,520
of game they're all from a city in China

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,170
we know their IP address and obviously

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,440
they cannot do this anymore but these

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,560
were BOTS that would simulate what a

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,550
human would do buying ticket would

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,320
automatically cancel these tickets they

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,180
simulated the human behavior very very

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,420
well meaning you would see the mouse

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,790
moving this is how good they are right

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,050
so fortunately for them there were some

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,180
patterns that they were not doing very

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,980
well and that's how we were able to

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,510
identify them but I would say this is

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,970
kind of this some of the most

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:24,820
sophisticated that we've seen so bot

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,670
management is critical here's here's why

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,250
this airline want to give the ability

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,440
for their customer to cancel plane

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,290
tickets it's a service from the airline

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,020
just not from when this customer have a

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,850
different intent which was the bot

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,680
traffic well this has been a really

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,300
fascinating discussion thanks for taking

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,300
