Roger McGough is here at velocity in New

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,819
York 2018 and I'm here with deep Hank

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,470
Sharma

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,570
who is a senior member of the technical

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,290
staff have arrived and welcome thank you

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,700
so much so you know velocity the top

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,070
except velocity have changed a lot over

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,250
the years and now we're talking about

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,680
about containers and kubernetes what is

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,990
the impact of these topics containers

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,640
and communities especially on technology

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,340
teams that the one that you're part of

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,900
so the BBC this you know every few years

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,270
that it that is something new that

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,739
happens in the software industry you

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,710
know cloud was one such even which was a

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,570
game changer and you know containers we

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,100
feel as another such event which is

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,719
going to be the game changer which is a

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,430
game changer already in the industry and

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,620
we at Verizon you know being being a

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,430
technology company we were precognitive

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,010
the fact you know it do helps us you

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,840
know in in in los of different aspects

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,250
like one of the biggest problems being a

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,340
large organization is that you know we

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,719
have different teams who write their

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,390
source software's in different different

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,379
languages and containers helps us you

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,390
know get rid of all those problems

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,159
because now all of us are just shipping

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,119
containers over to production clusters

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,189
that is one advantage and then we say

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,500
that you know we are velocity so it's

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,780
very prudent to just talk about velocity

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,189
because it helps us improve our velocity

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,650
to not even just push our code to

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,110
production faster but it also helps us

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,360
in you know moving our on from

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,710
applications to cloud faster because now

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,630
if in case you know there are even ten

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,610
different technology stacks by the time

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,829
you are container izing them and moving

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,869
on to a common cluster your CI CT

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,340
process just could be a cooking you know

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,680
plain cookie cutter model right how does

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,299
it affect the entire DevOps process

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,970
having these tools so you've kind of

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,799
covered that some but right so so you

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,829
know DevOps BBVA it contains off you

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,180
know development and operations I mean

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:56,549
most of the large organizations you know

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,640
the developers lifecycle like you know

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,540
it ends once he finishes this coating

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,950
and then you have you know the

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,060
operations team who takes care of you

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,590
know taking your code into production

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,390
and so on and so forth but what Witkin

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,340
and your Cuban it as it all becomes

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,950
simplified because now the developers

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,900
they control their their you know

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,269
software as to what should run in a

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,129
production cluster and also they they

00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,080
they specify as to how it should run on

00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,970
production of lustre so your DevOps is

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,549
kind of you know comes into the

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,569
development concern and it becomes

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,129
easier for for all the teams to manage

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,709
because North in case you just put a CI

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:33,640
CD process in place you you just become

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:35,620
a high performing team mm-hmm and this

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,299
all sounds great but there's challenges

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,849
I know with all right what do you think

00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:41,650
the best the main challenges are yeah so

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,840
as I said you know we are we're a large

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,299
organization we have you know FiOS we

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,910
have you know Verizon Wireless 5g is

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,890
coming around so we have like many teams

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,000
and we have thousands of developers so

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,640
that makes it even more challenging

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,590
because there are teams who are used to

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,950
doing their business delivery on a day

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,540
to day basis in it but but but it but

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,269
you know to ask them to change something

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,530
it it becomes a little difficult let's

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,470
say you know if in case you talk to talk

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,660
about migrating to cloud right so if in

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,090
case we try and say that you know to a

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,470
dotnet team that you know there is a

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,450
Java team which migrated over to clout

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,420
follow the same you know footsteps it

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,829
was difficult and same thing was here

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,579
with container than Cuban it is because

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,680
they have a bunch of different

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,450
technologies that they have to learn you

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,819
know to move over to Cuban I discussed a

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,250
faster so those were our challenges and

00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,200
and III think we address most of them

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,670
and what I think the learning curve is

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,450
in that for a typical like an

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,889
experienced engineer see it's the open

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,620
source world and that's the beauty of it

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:44,260
that you know whatever problems you face

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,060
at least ten other people would have

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,090
faced in front of you so so there are

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,650
you just need to know where to look and

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,750
you know find out that solution applied

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,769
and test it if in case even then it

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,349
doesn't work for you there are there

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,880
there are teams from different companies

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,010
who are working together as a collective

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,549
community to find solutions to those

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,919
problems

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,319
mmm-hmm so you're saying that open

00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,950
source is a big help in all this any

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,290
other role for open source yeah so I

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,269
think you know

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,330
it is definitely at the cost of you know

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,130
at the heart of it I mean Cuban it Isis

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,650
is one of the largest open-source

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,220
community you know in this world today

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,630
and and you know all the developers they

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,610
are there working on resolving the

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,229
issues that they face on a day to day

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,750
basis and they're all working

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,979
collectively the one of the biggest you

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,300
know impact is definitely the cost

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,919
factor that you know a large

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,870
organization they're they're not tying

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,660
themselves to an enterprise licenses

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,889
cost and so on and so on you know by the

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,150
time you know you have a Cuban I

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,289
discussed or running on a public cloud

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:48,360
you can just start deploying your

00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:52,260
application and you know apart from that

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,419
it also you know the like like like the

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,010
way we have used Cuban it is is that we

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,710
have these non fraud clusters which are

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,530
shared across multiple teams so that is

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,229
a big very you know huge cost advantage

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,330
for us mm-hmm so you mentioned public

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,160
clouds so how is the technology help you

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,690
like kind of fast-track and get the

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,919
stuff going for migrations right so you

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,650
know I think soups of containers on

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,360
Cuban it isn't and again I might be you

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,300
know touching down so certain points

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,970
that I said earlier that since you know

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,039
it helps us resolve all those

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,889
inconsistencies that especially we have

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,950
in our in our large organization because

00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,380
like you know we coined a term known as

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,820
snowflakes model like two snowflakes

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,919
coming out of a cloud and they are never

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,599
alike so we go and talk to all the

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,760
different teams and they do their DevOps

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:44,849
process see ICT process in a very

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,120
different way so so I think you know

00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:50,340
with all this in play it helped us

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,889
overcome all those challenges to a large

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,880
extent mm-hmm

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,830
so these are newest technologies what's

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,360
your approach to training in your

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,090
organization to you know the leverage

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,070
right so so we just followed you know

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,650
the best model in the world which is

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,020
open source model

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,150
we started have you know we built a

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,400
stack overflow within Verizon we built

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,350
you know Google Hangouts we built you

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,030
know shared libraries shared you know

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,190
applications which people could could

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,139
just download run them on a Cuban it is

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,729
cluster and know you know get get the

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,310
look and feel off of what the Cuban it

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,930
is cluster or a deployment does and and

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,660
and it's kind of the self learning and

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,759
and you know the best part is that we

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,139
started this in within Verizon and we

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,180
call it an inner sourcing model because

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,710
it is still you know within Verizon and

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,870
developers are helping each other and

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,840
they are adopting this model at a pretty

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,610
pretty rapid pace mm-hmm so it's not

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,419
that the migration is going pretty well

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,979
at Verizon how's the cost and we're

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:53,750
getting benefit from right so you know

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,970
first thing is the the virtual machines

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,590
to containers itself I mean that compare

00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,930
is in itself like you know makes your

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,370
cost at least 20% cheaper because let's

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,110
just talk about it you know we have five

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,090
micro services written in five different

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,620
languages and if in case I have to

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,729
deploy them into a production clusters I

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,009
need five different virtualization

00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:11,120
layers even if it isn't cloud right but

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,380
then if in case I'm talking about

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,180
containers those are just five

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,820
processors running on a single machine

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,750
so so that is a one of the biggest cost

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,550
advantage for us

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,010
second thing is you know the shared

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,990
tenant model where we can now have a

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,120
single cluster being shared by multiple

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,979
teams so we are not you know installing

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,960
clusters after after clusters Kuban it

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,520
is gives us namespaces so we just carve

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,010
out a small namespace give it to a team

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,840
and they start developing so that is

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,940
second and third and the most important

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,620
as it is an open source tool right now

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,169
and whatever whatever issues you face

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,699
you have a large army of the best

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,370
developers in the world supporting that

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,020
particular block mm-hmm yeah no that's

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,570
we hear a lot with open source

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,280
developers in the world so one of the

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,030
things with all this is notion of

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,360
resiliency and how does the architecture

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,479
help with resiliency and then that's a

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,770
pretty good question because you know

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,840
going to production faster like move

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,300
into production faster is one aspect but

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,260
then one of the biggest challenges that

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,080
you know

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,550
have as their their monitoring models

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,290
are so different their resiliency models

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,120
are so different but but with Cuban it

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,070
is we can just have one so we are

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,280
working on you know we are working with

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,500
Google on finalizing or you not learning

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,080
the new terms which are the SRS there's

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,370
the site reliability engineering and we

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,110
are defining so we are moving away from

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,760
the SLA models like you know which is

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,010
the age old model right but we are going

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,510
going towards the more SLO which is the

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,560
service level objectives like you set

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,840
your objectives and you gauge your

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,810
performance so so we are moving towards

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,790
that and we tend to you know build it in

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,160
a way that it becomes consistent for the

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,630
entire organization right well thanks

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,630
