hi this is Mike Hendrickson from fluent

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,420
in velocity in San Jose I'm here with a

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,730
mid and how you doing I'm doing well

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,710
thanks you're worth Oracle yes I am so

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,389
what are you guys doing to make life

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,950
easier for the modern application

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,839
developer now we're doing quite a few

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,190
things I'm in over the last few years we

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,170
have been building out a whole cloud

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,880
platform which allows developers to

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,199
build any kind of applications so we

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
cater to every kind of developer you can

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,160
think of one is anybody doing cloud

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,289
native development so we have a set of

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,580
services and capabilities for any cloud

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,250
native developer to build an application

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,020
either in Java or run it on know the

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,480
rule people provide a polyglot based

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,860
programming interface as well as provide

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,170
them tooling to build those applications

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,489
very easily and then we have also

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,050
capabilities for anybody you want to

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,149
lift and shift in application so if you

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,860
have build an application in ISP or any

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,360
custom or bespoke application you had

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,129
you want to move it to the cloud we

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,390
provide you tooling for that as well

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,680
I'll be able to run those things without

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,360
having to rewrite a lot of the code and

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,860
redo the testing and that's what can

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,770
shift lift and shift if you want to call

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,170
it yeah yeah yeah so that's that because

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,850
quite a few customers we speak to

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,680
nowadays who have a lot of application

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,080
assets and they want to leverage that

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,000
and then build around them so we allow

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,799
you to take that workload and move it to

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,390
the cloud providing the tooling for that

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,790
as well as be able to do extensions on

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,939
it while people are doing this lift and

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,890
shift lifting lifters ship to fist yes

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,220
while they're doing that are they are

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,020
they also looking at how they make these

00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,509
shifts or these lifts into micro

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,579
services and how to containerize parts

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,590
of this is not outside the cloud the

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,880
cloud native part is similar idea where

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,700
you would have the capability of doing

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,159
micro services based architecture have

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,500
API based design and be able to deliver

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,579
this on a much more modern platform so

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,570
when they're doing lift and shift one

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,040
thing they want to do is take the

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,720
existing assets they had in the code

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,090
business logic and move it first and

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,100
then they either redo some of the pieces

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,439
of it and build micro services and build

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,700
it in much more modern way as well as

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,020
they want to be extensions which they

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,939
write in the micro services environment

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,070
so now you can have a mixture of things

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,390
available to you from the investments

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,310
you've made as well as extensions you

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,350
created so then you can modernize and

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,619
get the value very quickly so you seen

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,679
this as a a general move or general I'd

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,770
like to shift metaphor as a digital

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,690
transfer at piece

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,920
their digital transformation are you

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,480
seeing that with the customers you're

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,940
working with oh yeah and I think it's

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,650
very very common part of this strategy

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,780
where they just don't want to do

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,700
everything from scratch so you do want

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,930
to take advantage of modern environments

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,400
and modern technologies but you also

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,120
will take values of facets you had so

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,260
when they're doing the digital

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,900
transformation and move to the cloud

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,000
they would identify the workloads they

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,680
want to keep and they wanted able to

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,690
leverage and then they start doing a lot

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,950
of the shifting as you said and then

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,030
building around it and then you can have

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,900
different kind of developers around it

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,520
right so you can have a professional

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,620
developer who want to write code in node

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,120
or Ruby whatever it is and Bill

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,560
micro-services you could have a

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,270
developer with a much more visual based

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,610
like more you call it citizen developer

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,100
or local developer who want to do much

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,450
more visual design and really do

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,340
extension without having to write any

00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,320
code but the platform underneath the

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,090
cover still remains the same so anybody

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,200
can work on it but I can provide you

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,210
different interfaces and different

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,390
capabilities a different level to build

00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,870
on those code bases and you allow them

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,850
then to also build more of a hybrid

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:17,320
solution as well like maybe they have

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,180
some secure or compliant oh yes software

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,010
that they have to keep running on

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,300
funding this or yeah yeah so I think

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,070
it's very part of a big part of a

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,240
strategy is to of course have customers

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,280
to choose where they want to deploy

00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,360
things so a lot of customers might want

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,980
to say you know what I'll do this

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,480
particular service of this application

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,459
running is a public cloud because I'm

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,470
okay with the privacy laws or whatever

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,910
may be the case or I just want to do

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,890
tests there were initially and then

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,570
start doing prototyping but I might have

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,070
a regulation requirements where I have

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,350
to move the data and everything behind

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,180
my firewall like provide you as Oracle

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,400
we provided the full same stack the

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,290
public cloud stack which runs you micro

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,930
services runs you APRI runs all your

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,850
kubernetes and docker images and let it

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,980
run that behind the firewall of any data

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,420
center you choose so and then whenever

00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,920
you choose to do redeploy it in the

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,660
cloud you can do that without having to

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,370
rewrite the code or retest it which is a

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,290
big part of kind of the comfort of our

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,970
customers fine from us where we provide

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,160
you the full seamlessness between the

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,840
two models and have a hybrid deployment

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,520
topology where you can connect those

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,630
things together as well you might have a

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,430
lot of existing on-premise applications

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,320
as well you want connecting to the cloud

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,700
based systems you building and we

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,829
provide you that capability as well so

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,620
Oracle's also a global come come

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,569
phrase so you have customers pretty much

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,449
across the boards are there any

00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:31,030
differences in those geographic areas of

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,759
companies that are transitioning quicker

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,650
lifting and shifting more yes not we

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,379
definitely see a lot of different phases

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,580
of adoption and different mindsets as

00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,650
well I think many countries of course

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,960
have a lot of regulations where the data

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,879
residency becomes an important aspects

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,289
of how you deploy your application so

00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,270
that we do have customers who say you

00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,650
know we love the public cloud but we

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,560
would definitely want a data center in

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,629
our country or you want to have

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,090
something which is privately run behind

00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,710
our firewall so especially a lot of a

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,080
lot of countries in Europe we see that

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,650
Asia is very similar as well in many

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,300
places

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,650
I think Network becomes an issue as well

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,030
because you kind of expect to have data

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,740
centers every country you can think of

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,509
and that's what that what we're seeing

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,490
is we have in this deployment model

00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:14,379
called clouded customer where we take an

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,029
extension of a public cloud it runs the

00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:18,729
same way it's the same subscription

00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:20,770
service it's the same patching model we

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,779
upgrade and maintain everything but it

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,460
runs wherever you choose to so we come

00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,169
in and get it going and then we run it

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,810
all remotely and run it as part of the

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:31,029
clouds it gets completely in sync with

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,379
the public cloud offering we have so we

00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,879
think that government agencies very

00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,310
similar as well in different countries

00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,650
and are there any industries that you

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,770
see moving quicker than others and and

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,550
and likewise what are you guys doing to

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,659
attract maybe the polite words sure so

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,219
obviously definitely the industries in

00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,610
terms of quick adoption I think we're

00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:53,139
seeing a lot of interest from retail

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,909
there's a huge need for them to get

00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,199
online and get a lot of the services

00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,029
running cloud and very agile way

00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,069
predicting what their customers want and

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,900
what they make and when you're exactly

00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,520
and the capacity all the changes the

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,389
demand changes depending the seasons and

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,339
everything so you don't want to upfront

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:07,659
commitment on the cost part yeah so

00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,759
we're seeing a retail being one of the

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,529
early very quick mover in that area

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,029
receiving something similar with telcos

00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,409
and they always had affinity to

00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:16,150
technology anywhere and they know how to

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,409
run data centers but then now they want

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,029
to kind of get the benefits of having a

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,650
much bigger broader public cloud

00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,379
services running in places they might

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,729
want very similarly financial services

00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,900
strangely enough is starting to now take

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,089
a lot of their workloads and start

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,190
running it also in public cloud so

00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:31,959
that's another area government agencies

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,430
very very quickly they want to reduce

00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,710
the cost and have a predictable

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,850
model of government agencies no it's

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,280
mostly what we see in state and local

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,770
very fast okay because they have a lot

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,800
more noodle flexibility than the federal

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,630
in the US as well as internationally we

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,430
see in many countries they lot more

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,220
adoption towards that kind of a model

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,620
alright and the guy in the car if you

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,200
look at industries like I would say

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,290
manufacturing again very heavy workload

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,210
oriented very costly investment so

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,790
they're starting to quickly take up all

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,200
this cloud in adoption but they need to

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,640
figure out how to immortai the existing

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,080
investment they've made that little

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,940
slower usually for them because there

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,830
you have something a lot of cost in the

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,210
data centers so that's the one we help

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,070
out a lot with where everything here you

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,780
want the public cloud benefits I'll let

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,250
you run it in your data center but

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,960
you're getting to pick up the club the

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,940
cloud benefits and modern development

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,970
environments run cloud native stuff

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,390
without having to do everything again

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,920
from scratch so Amit if we sat down

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,560
twelve months from now and had this

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,020
conversation next year at this time at

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,560
this event what would you like to say

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,580
Oracle is doing for developers

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
differently at that time than you are

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,240
today sure I think the bigger what do

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,640
you see over the next twelve months one

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,200
is the ability to have all the tooling

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,330
and the latest technologies all

00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,620
integrated into one platform right as I

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,210
said we provide you the cloud native

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,310
platform we provide you the ability to

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,170
do a lot of container based application

00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,180
development we provide the visual ways

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,830
of building applications over the next

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,260
12 months what you'll see is a lot of

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,580
tooling and extraction so that all of

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,990
the things underneath the covers work

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,370
seamlessly and you can pick and choose

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,320
the technologies you want to use and

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,630
deploy on and we provided the full

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,580
capabilities there without having to

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,350
make decisions upfront any time some of

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,570
the stems right so hiding some of the

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,950
complexity yeah ease of use for sure we

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,740
starting to do a lot of work around the

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,240
unification of our user interfaces we

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,860
making a lot of the tooling a lot of the

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,840
developers like so we just recently

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,120
announced announcement a partnership

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,310
with docker for example partnership with

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,570
doing things with kubernetes things

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,370
we're doing with a lot of other open

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,050
source technologies as all of the

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,530
services are now getting baked into a

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:42,470
platform and we're doing a lot of work

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,340
around Hadoop and spark and tasks so a

00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,560
lot of the things are coming together

00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,060
now so the twelve months this platform

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,800
is going to be even much more robust

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,529
much more

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,420
easy-to-use and I would say very very

00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,890
comprehensive excellent what we look

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,670
forward that combinational money -

00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,670
thanks

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,450
