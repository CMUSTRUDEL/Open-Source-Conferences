Title: Perception and bias and metrics, oh my! - Dawn Parzych (Catchpoint)
Publication date: 2017-06-21
Playlist: Velocity 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Human perception and biases can influence how metrics are interpreted. While valid metrics can open lines of communication across and within teams, using vanity metrics or data to shame others can be counterproductive. Dawn Parzych explains how you can make a real and lasting impact on your organization by understanding the influence assumptions and biases have and how to present credible data.

	00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:10,660
good morning everyone I am here to break

00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:14,830
a little bit of bad news to you you're

00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,199
biased everybody here is biased and if

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,779
you think you're not biased that in

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,140
itself is a bias called the bias blind

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:27,039
spot we think of bias as a negative

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,800
thing but it's not bias helps us

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,480
understand the world around us there are

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,930
over a hundred and eighty different

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,420
biases listed on Wikipedia

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,330
decision-making biases not invented here

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,370
if I didn't build this I don't want to

00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,070
support it

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,230
hindsight bias I knew that release

00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,140
shouldn't have gone out we should have

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:54,070
waited a little bit longer and social

00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:57,070
biases that launch went great I'm

00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,730
responsible for all of that that's a

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:04,330
self-serving bias

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:08,320
why do biases exist thinking is hard we

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,470
don't like to think we are overwhelmed

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,860
with information we capture thousands of

00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,200
metrics on our systems but those metrics

00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,659
don't have any meaning because we take

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,750
them out of context when an issue

00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,130
happens we are all hands on deck trying

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,590
to get MTTR

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,740
down and get that issue resolved as

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:33,070
quickly as possible and we don't have

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:37,270
enough memory we forget things so this

00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:41,170
is why we deal with biases six seconds

00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,600
is this fast or slow for a web page to

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,770
load

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:50,409
chances are you think it's slow because

00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,630
we've heard that pages need to load in

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:56,229
about three seconds otherwise we lose

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:59,080
users that's an anchor we've heard this

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:02,350
and we anchor on it and we don't think

00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,180
about anything else if you were dealing

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,430
with a situation where a page took 10

00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,450
seconds slowed and you reduce that down

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,249
to 6 seconds that's a huge improvement

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,139
but you didn't start with a 10 second

00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:16,400
anchor you started with that 3 second

00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:20,070
anchor

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,160
we want our companies our teams our

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,100
projects to be seen as a success as a

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,470
result we sometimes rely on wood called

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,470
vanity metrics these are metrics that

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,020
make us feel great about what we're

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,630
doing they confirm our beliefs that

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,980
we're doing something right looking at

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,280
something like the number of downloads

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,230
or page views that doesn't give us a lot

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,090
of information but we feel really really

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,090
good when we see those metrics go up

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:55,140
narrative bias we like stories they help

00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,290
us remember information as opposed to

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:04,170
just empirical evidence of a number when

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,300
we have a high bounce rate on a page we

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,320
automatically look for why that bounce

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,380
rate is so high

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,110
well bounce rates high page responses

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,980
and good that must be the reason if

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,310
there's a reason we can correct it our

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,530
brains are impressive we look for

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,750
patterns even though half of this is

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,870
covered your brain reads this

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,450
it reads jumping to conclusions but

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,230
that's not what this says it's saw

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:39,780
pattern it recognized it and it jumped

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:43,140
to a conclusion because we are so visual

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,710
we need to visualize our data stop just

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,040
reporting on an average these two charts

00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:52,830
are very very different but when you

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,270
compute the average of all of these data

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,100
points they're identical I prefer an

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,810
average it looks like a dinosaur over a

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,460
random sampling of dots here but all is

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,480
not lost there are ways that we can

00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,850
avoid bias when we're looking at data

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,070
one admit that your bias and understand

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,370
how those biases are influencing what

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,459
you're thinking to create your own

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,830
anchor don't look at what those industry

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,260
studies say necessarily look at what

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:30,290
makes sense for your business

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,290
don't set a metric that isn't achievable

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:41,250
I'm stuck okay ask questions foster an

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,430
environment where it's okay to ask a

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,590
question don't shame people for raising

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,120
a question and asking something doesn't

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,400
matter whether the person asking the

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,350
question is a junior engineer a senior

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,290
engineer somebody in sales somebody in

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:59,280
marketing accepts the questions and also

00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,980
accept the answers if you're unwilling

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,010
to accept an answer when it contradicts

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,480
what you believe that is how biases are

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,959
enforced over time thank you

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,959
