	00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:08,010
so here's my story so I said I graduated

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,650
is 30 years ago and started a job at a

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,349
small company I had no idea what I was

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,879
getting into but what I found out was

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,680
the most very first day of the job my

00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,880
boss walked into my office and he had

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,800
this binder it was full of a printout of

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,330
the software that I now owned the

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,029
project that I now own he dumped it on

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,130
my desk and he said this is your project

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:30,750
yes it was all printed out there was an

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,790
online version as well in the computer

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,710
um but seriously it all fit in this

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,820
binder was kind of crazy to think about

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,800
that now

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,969
and I wasn't going to be able to read it

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,120
right out so I don't know why I gave you

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,500
the binder in any case this is my

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,420
project and I got to work with an

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,620
engineer and a tester and it was an

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,230
analytical instrument that did some

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:55,320
analysis of elements super interesting

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,480
work and and it was my project it was

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,739
super exciting and super was a huge

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,730
amount of responsibility for somebody

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,580
right out of school but I loved it and

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,380
ultimately I took many different domains

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,380
after that so this is analytical

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,180
instrumentation I did some work in

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,640
automotive and then I decided to go back

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,200
to grad school and when I went back to

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,030
was going back to grad school I talked

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,000
to my boss at the time who had a PhD in

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,350
computer science and he said master's

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,610
degrees find AI and don't get a PhD

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,920
you'll never get hired in industry again

00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:31,680
and I only tell you this story because

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,840
when I talk to people about talking to

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,220
you today I also heard that story now I

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,930
don't know if this is still true I know

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,780
that there are clearly places in the

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,880
valley that do hire PhDs and thus boss

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,520
of mine did have a PhD if I didn't

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,460
mention that so I do trust what he said

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,230
but it was the sense that people would

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,870
think I was to see a radical if I had a

00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,760
PhD and I did fight that with a master's

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,110
degree even my first job I had to

00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,340
actually argue that I wasn't too

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,570
theoretical which was really kind of

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,520
amusing to me in any case um I my first

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,130
job after grad school was a human

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,650
genomic startup and I loved this job it

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,289
was so exciting the domain was exciting

00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,240
the software was exciting and one thing

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,840
that I learned about myself in this job

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,300
was that I was much

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,970
less risk-averse than I thought I

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,129
thought that you know I was very worried

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,930
about financial security but I realized

00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,040
in the startup where I didn't know if we

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,300
were going to run out of money or not

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,599
and I didn't know if I was going to get

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,620
paid at some point but I I could whether

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,090
some of those those waters right and so

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,209
I ended up becoming a software

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,110
consultant which is maybe on the far

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:44,260
edge of not risk-averse and ultimately

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,640
sort of fell into entrepreneurship so I

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,880
call this my accidental entrepreneur

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,400
stage where I was a software consultant

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,880
who took on some projects worked with a

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,500
partner we started hiring consultants

00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,940
projects got bigger we couldn't find

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,250
enough consultants to do the work that

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,780
people wanted us to do so we hired and

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,940
we had to hire employees and this is

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,379
where everything changes when you have

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,849
employees and you're looking across the

00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,620
desk at someone you're saying I'm

00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,030
interviewing you today and I know when

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,540
times get tough you're getting paid and

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,950
I'm not how much do I really like you

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,400
that's the story of the entrepreneur

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,470
right and and it's true um you do have

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,260
to think about those things but you also

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,090
learn a lot being an entrepreneur you

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,700
learn about a lot about running a team I

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,579
learned a lot about financial statements

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,900
and running a company and believe me if

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,099
you want to talk about healthcare today

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,889
it's a big deal I know a lot about

00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:38,260
health care more much more than I wanted

00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,180
to know and at some point I realized

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,130
that this wasn't what I wanted to do I

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,680
had built this great company with great

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,510
culture for engineers for my employees

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,609
and I thought I would retire there

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,560
because why else would I build a company

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:53,560
like this right but I realized that it

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,419
wasn't what I wanted it to be I wasn't

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,280
doing what I wanted to do I was spending

00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:59,950
time looking at cash flow and retained

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,359
earnings and getting enough sales to

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,819
keep all the people that were working

00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:05,440
for me working and then hiring more

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,970
people when the projects got bigger and

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,940
then having to get more sales this

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,889
constant hamster wheel right this isn't

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,250
what I want to do so I thought maybe I

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:18,430
just needed a infusion of technology so

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,200
I had been really interested in Scala I

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,719
had been doing some research on the side

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,240
and I decided I would write a book about

00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:28,610
Scala and try to see if Scala could be

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,350
it's introduced to people to beginners

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,270
because it was getting a big a bad rap

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,229
as a really hard language to learn and I

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,570
didn't really think it was that hard

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:37,250
anyways so I wrote a book about Scala

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,870
and it was super fun and I realized that

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,270
Yelp that's what I was missing that

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,220
technology piece so I decided I should

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,220
