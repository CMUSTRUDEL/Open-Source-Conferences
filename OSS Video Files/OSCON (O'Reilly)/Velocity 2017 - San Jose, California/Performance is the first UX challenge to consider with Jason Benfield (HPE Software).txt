hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,420
velocity in fluent in San Jose I'm here

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,760
with Jason from HPE Jason how you doing

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,830
I'm doing great how you doing good

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,740
so HPE you guys have been around

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,600
velocity for quite a few years yeah what

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,880
do you guys up to so you know all right

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:26,580
HP software is has been around forever

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,490
right and most of our products have been

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,430
purchased within your traditional center

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:37,399
of excellent central IT shared services

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:42,030
organization and really successful

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:45,300
within that part of organizations we

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,850
have a newer set of products that are

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,700
more geared towards agile communities

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,980
DevOps what we refer to as a line of

00:00:50,700 --> 00:01:01,440
business and velocity provides us an

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:05,580
outlet to talk to actual developers and

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:10,860
testers and practitioners that operate

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,530
in those agile communities and it's just

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,350
a really important resource for us to be

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,320
able to have those conversations and be

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,659
able to direct our products in the right

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,630
way to figure me to that and so what are

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,150
you offering developers here at velocity

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,060
with so they come up to you and what do

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,750
they want to know yeah so we're really

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,770
kind of running a little bit of a user

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,689
experience focus for myself I run our

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,320
product management team for our

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,299
performance testing solutions and

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,659
performance is just one acts aspect of

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,829
the user experience what we're seeing in

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,560
the market now is a realization that we

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,600
can spend a lot of money on making sure

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,280
the buttons are in the right place and

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,979
move the right color and we're using the

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,649
right font and all that stuff but it's a

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,860
web page doesn't load all of that does

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,099
MOLLE it goes to waste right so

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,020
performance is actually the first most

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,850
immediate use

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,990
our experience that people have and so

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,440
we've had a lot of customer

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,410
conversations with people here around

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,050
performance testing specifically within

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,640
the agile world and you know we're

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,870
talking to them about loadrunner and

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,570
Performance Center which have been

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,210
around for 25 years and are really good

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,490
tools but really having a lot of

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,920
conversations around our newer offering

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,470
stronger on the load what was that

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,290
stores dorm runner load storm runner

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,880
load and what's effective it's a

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,790
performance testing solution that's

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,500
based in the cloud and it allows you to

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,170
generate the load from a variety of

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,800
different cloud locations so on the back

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,950
end

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,520
we'll use AWS and azure and Rackspace

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,740
and other vendors to be able to generate

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,860
load from locations around the world so

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,380
it's kind of a load balancer or

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,960
measurement it's it's more of a load

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,990
generation tool okay so to allow you to

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,360
test high levels of traffic against an

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,550
application or website excellent and

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,520
runs across all the major cloud

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:27,450
platforms yeah it touches into all the

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,930
cloud platforms various locations around

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,010
the world and you know we've gotten it

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,340
to the point where we can actually

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,590
simulate up to 3 million simultaneous

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,980
users now we'll be up to 6 million later

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,030
this year but as a vocal component as

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:48,110
well yeah we will hire you in two

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:52,260
different mobile testing solutions and

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:55,380
so you can usually in the performance

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,260
world people don't have a hundred

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,350
thousand mobile phones sitting around to

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,700
be able to test the mobile application

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,820
so they want to what they want to be

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,770
able to do is they want to be able to

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,680
generate a bunch of traffic from a load

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,440
generation tool and then use a subset of

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,890
live devices to be able to see the

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,799
reaction of the application when the

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,949
rest of the servers and everything

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,639
is under a large amount of stress so is

00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,830
that a really popular part of the

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,599
testing application is yeah mobile the

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:37,520
yeah I think they are lean you know web

00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:42,490
is still yeah first and foremost you

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:47,090
know the the big object that we see but

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:49,970
mobile testing is becoming you know more

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:55,159
and more serious so we're seeing more

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:57,710
and more requests to add capabilities to

00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:59,629
that side of the application so we're

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,090
involved with mobile testing today but

00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:05,479
we just we expect to just expand that

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:09,139
moving forward excellent so what would

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,750
you say is the fastest growing type

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:15,250
industry you guys work with that looks

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,740
at performance is very important yeah

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,840
it's interesting the you know I think

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,490
everyone thinks of retail right I mean

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,979
whenever you hit Black Friday there's

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,580
some story about someone crashing or

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,080
Amazon successive just dominating yeah

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,949
yeah absolutely

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,139
and you know there's there's always

00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:39,500
challenges during those peak season

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,060
periods and so you know for a long time

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,599
it's been the story of during peak

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,389
season I really need to test my mobile

00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:49,610
application my website to be able to

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,740
prepare for that peak season one of the

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:56,000
changes that we're kind of seeing now is

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,620
that you know we actually fixed our

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,729
website so we could handle all that

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,500
traffic but our ERP drugs with with

00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,479
having to handle all the orders and

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,219
process all the orders and push them

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,169
through the backend and we lost revenue

00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:10,819
because of that so now we're actually

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,669
seeing a little bit of an expansion

00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:16,969
where enterprises yeah we need to test

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:18,560
the website the mobile app but we

00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:20,990
actually also have to pay attention to

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,120
our back-end systems as well during peak

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,210
traffic so full-stack really yeah yeah

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,840
also it's becoming more of a we have to

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,199
balance and test and

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,350
deploy the full stack not just the

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:38,169
commercial facing it's going deeper and

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,229
I think it's just kind of illustrative

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,870
of the complexity of the environments

00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,070
that we work in today because I think

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,440
I'm not going to say that performance

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,610
testing was easy and the task because

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,919
it's always been a little bit of a

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,229
challenge but it was relatively linear

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,479
right so you tested a front-end

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,639
application it talked to one or two

00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,560
back-end systems which talked to a

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,810
couple of others but it was pretty

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,389
straightforward right now when you're

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,880
trying to test a web application it goes

00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,919
all over the place right you've got big

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,110
data you're talking to third party

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,660
system maybe some machine hail victims

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,639
it's all over the place right and then

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,229
you're trying to spawn with micro

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,570
services and containers so one of the

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:25,479
biggest challenges in our industry is

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,210
that you know sure it's one thing to be

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:31,630
able to generate a lot of traffic from a

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,310
tool and cause a website to crash ok

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,700
anyone can do that

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,620
the hard part is figuring out what the

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,810
root cause of that problem is when

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,030
you're touching so many back-end systems

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,940
some of which you control and some of

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,849
which you don't and that's the focus of

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,460
our solutions is really that root cause

00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:55,090
analysis to cut down that time so Jason

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,430
put on your vision glasses yeah and tell

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,080
me what HPE should be doing twelve

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:05,050
months from now that you're not doing

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:09,190
today it's a good question so twelve

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:17,320
months from now what we should be doing

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:20,950
is moving beyond mobile in Toyota right

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,130
that's the next step the edge even

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,260
further absolutely absolutely because I

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:30,460
think that's the you know the

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:32,770
performance crisis today are people all

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,300
right it's the number of people we have

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,970
on their mobile phones and on the

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:41,530
sites and doing the same thing at the

00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:46,260
same time when you add things to that

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:49,030
mix that are doing similar behavior

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,120
those issues get multiplied right

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,880
because we're you know our retail

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,220
customers are worried about 6 million

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,120
people accessing the website at the same

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,790
time when you get into the IOT space

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,160
you're 25 million 30 million 40 million

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,080
devices trying to do the same thing at

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,560
the same time and perhaps less structure

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,470
and less predictability and yeah very

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,910
abstract yep turning it in so that's I

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,830
think the challenge in 12 months

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,820
excellent thank you Jason hey yeah thank

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,820
you appreciate

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,540
