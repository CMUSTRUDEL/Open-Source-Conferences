so why should we care I mean we should

00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:10,360
care because it's kind of humane right

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,610
thing to do and I'm going to read this

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,589
quote aloud because I really enjoy this

00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,930
quote this is a few years old and it was

00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:21,090
when kind of the idea that pagespeed

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:23,620
matters really started to appear in in

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,970
mainstream media and so there was an

00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,850
article a great article that was written

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,750
in new york times and a feature it was I

00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,490
think was sort of highlighting some

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,610
Google research that it had that is that

00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:36,789
had been performed about how even like

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,769
100 milliseconds page delay mattered and

00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,059
it's a really great article I recommend

00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,890
you look it up the title at the bottom

00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,870
of the slide but there's a reader

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,059
comment where somebody's I just picture

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,100
there's kind of a cranky old like SNL

00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:50,050
type character kind of go pity the hyper

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,909
impatient web generation such as he

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,949
lives so many important things to do

00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:55,719
like post the latest drivel onto their

00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:58,479
Facebook pages or download the YouTube

00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,109
viral video of the day oops sorry of the

00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,629
minute so I think about that person and

00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:06,490
I think they're not alone like I I've

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,930
since sort of heard people say things

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,970
like well we should just learn to be

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,220
patient you know why why does it matter

00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,110
so much if pages are slow it's a you

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,150
problem it's just you know it's kind of

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,660
all in your head just adapt I get you

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,740
know suck it up don't be a baby

00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,590
but there's a reason why we care the

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,450
average web user believes I'm not saying

00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,030
that this is actually the case that they

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:31,360
believe that they waste two days a year

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,030
waiting for web pages to load like total

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,460
two days 48 hours of their time precious

00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,290
life moments spent waiting for pages to

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,810
load do I think that's actually true

00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:44,110
probably not but the fact is people feel

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,390
this way they feel the lag of the

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,400
Internet as a presence in their lives

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,440
that actually prevents them from doing

00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,440
other things they would like to do and

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,510
to me this is really really important

00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,909
another thing that people feel is web

00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,250
stress this is a term that was coined a

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,680
few years ago a paper that was released

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,390
by CA technologies I'm sorry sirs fake

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,050
emissions from a company called Foveon

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:10,060
and they hooked a eg whet headsets onto

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,260
people and had them kind of go through

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,950
the paces of doing different

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,640
transactions on a desktop and they found

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,620
they met were able to

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,140
measure at a neurological level that

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,770
when sites are up sir slow it actually

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,300
to work

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:27,190
50% harder to stay on task a few years

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,959
later when I was working for a company

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,550
called rad where we replicated that

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,959
research but using mobile devices and

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,850
this is actual photo from the study that

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,340
we did basically found the same thing

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,380
even on mobile and what was really

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,500
important to notice in this particular

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,870
study is the latency that we introduced

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,760
was not massive amounts of latency it

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,440
was the equivalent of taking pages that

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,820
loaded in roughly three or four seconds

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,070
and making them load in five or six

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,410
seconds and we found the same issues

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,750
with people having a harder time staying

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,700
engaged frustration levels spiking

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,739
engagement levels dropping and we could

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:05,980
measure all of this this is a I love

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:08,350
this phrase rage clicks hat tip to

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,540
Philip Telus and Nick Jan's moves so

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,190
step four for kind of bringing this to

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,950
my attention at a talk that they did at

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,360
velocity last year where basically it's

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,459
a real thing you can measure this like

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,380
your users they're just pummeling their

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,060
mouse buttons or they're hitting the

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,310
screen on their phones out of

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,170
frustration the fact that this the site

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,170
isn't or the app isn't responding

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,750
and it was slightly a few years ago I

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,420
went looking for a city I wanted to see

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,290
if somebody had ever done any research

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,090
on how people react when the when sites

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,380
are apps are slow on their phone and of

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,130
course somebody had done a study it was

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,780
tea leaf back in 2011 and I don't know

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,549
how well you could see this at the back

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,220
but what was really interesting was that

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:57,010
kind of about 60% of people more or less

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,709
behaved normally but all those other the

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,230
yellow the green the red are all people

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,910
having terrible reactions to the phones

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,709
being slow and the red is four percent

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,769
of people claim that they throw in their

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,810
phone when as I say was with a site was

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,180
slow I've never done that but I

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,880
definitely in the green and yellow camp

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,720
so I'm definitely not super proud of it

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,720
