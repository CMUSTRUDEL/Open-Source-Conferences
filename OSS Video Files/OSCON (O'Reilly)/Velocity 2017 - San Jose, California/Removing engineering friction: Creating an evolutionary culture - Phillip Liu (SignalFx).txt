Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: Velocity 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Phillip Liu explores the one thing that has become a driver of ever better engineering: constant removal of friction for engineers to not only build and ship code but also understand how code is used and how it works and operates. The end result is a culture that promotes many possible ways to address given challenges and surfaces novel approaches, which may have never arisen otherwise.
