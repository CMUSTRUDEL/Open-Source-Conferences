if you have cross-site scripting bugs or

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,500
sequel injection or XML injection or

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,380
buffer overflows you can fix this you

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,030
can fix this at the framework level at a

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,290
glance of a waterfall chart you can see

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,639
all types of things that might be wrong

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,430
with your page and maybe you've got a

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,140
front-end single point of failure or

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,810
reflects locking elsewhere problems with

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,570
third parties or for spy times all of

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,890
these tools necessary not sufficient you

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,660
want to build a future we want to live

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,160
in as humans you have to talk to each

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,740
other oh by the way I'm getting ready to

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,850
deploy a small schema change to the

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,920
database now people who have a good user

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,660
experience spend on average a hundred

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,570
and forty percent more than people had a

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,340
bad experience your success depends upon

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,350
being able to change the code that's in

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,390
production when you need to the way you

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,309
prioritize it is not looking at what's

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,230
lowest on your website but look instead

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,030
of let users care about the most we've

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,219
gotten to talk to thousands of the

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,440
world's best off teams that's dev team

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,629
that's DevOps teams and more than a

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,110
handful of teams they're genuinely

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,920
struggling this is all completely

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,460
changing the way we actually about

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,460
performance

00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,000
