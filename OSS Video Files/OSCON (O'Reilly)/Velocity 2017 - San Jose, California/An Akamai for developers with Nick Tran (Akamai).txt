hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,339
velocity in fluent in San Jose I'm here

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,460
with Nick Tran Nick how you doing I'm

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,530
doing great so you're with Akamai yeah

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,380
and for those out there that don't know

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,310
what Akamai is or what they do can you

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,670
give us a 10,000 foot view of it yeah so

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,119
we are the world's largest and most

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,949
trusted cloud delivery platform in the

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,679
world what we do is we help companies

00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:34,440
build and deliver like really amazing

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,129
and the most secure digital experiences

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,899
that's what we aim to do and we we do

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:45,030
that with this massively distributed

00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:48,059
platform that we have consisting of two

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,030
hundred thousand servers located you

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,550
know in 130 countries around the world

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,320
including even an article you know it's

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,149
in our country

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,160
and yeah I think on a given day we will

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,250
power up to one-third of the world's

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,130
Internet traffic so if you by chance

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,270
I'll check your phone or browse the

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,000
Internet today there's a pretty good

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,830
chance that you use some concept from

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,470
from vacuum eyes on their hearts so

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,380
Lee's had a like a massive CDN

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,759
distributed everywhere yeah so the

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,780
primary technique that we use to deliver

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,210
this content

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,890
it's called edge caching and that's what

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,280
clapping you know content distribution

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,750
networks do and what that means is that

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:40,049
we store copies of your images your

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,270
video your audio bits and bytes anything

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,909
we store copies of those things on

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,079
servers again long are 200,000 servers

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:54,570
throughout the world and that when users

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:57,210
need to retrieve content you know they

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,909
would then most likely hit one of our

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,640
edge servers closest to them as opposed

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,600
to trying to fetch content halfway

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,399
around the world at the origin server so

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,530
what are you offering developers here

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,180
this weekend at these

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,100
and so what we are actually really

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,500
highlighting at this event is our new

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,240
Ahmed Developer Program and it is a new

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,630
effort by a combine to really engage

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,330
this really empowered audience that we

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,709
haven't really connected with before and

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:36,930
so as a program we offer over 40

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,319
different sets of api's more education

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,120
than you would ever need a bunch of the

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,310
SDKs that we're in that are in

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,430
development we support nine different

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,380
languages with our client libraries so

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,100
if you're looking to automate and

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,670
configure and really extend your logic

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,739
out to the edge we give you those

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,920
capabilities and are you making any

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,260
announcements here at the event yes so

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,769
we are we just announced this week

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,760
Akamai for DevOps which is a collection

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,800
of tooling capabilities and

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,700
documentation to help really help you

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,560
automate your CDI CD workflow like that

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,860
has not been a story that we haven't

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,320
touched upon in looking in the past but

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,570
we're really making an effort to you

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,940
know listen to developers help improve

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,329
their developer experience or their

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,600
DevOps experience and and one of the

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,970
most exciting things within our

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,000
announcement this week is our new Akamai

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,920
CLI which would be the third way in

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,739
which you would manage and configure

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,890
your Akamai instance the first two being

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,730
using our console graphical console with

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,459
point click and the second way would be

00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:58,769
direct access to our configuration with

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,620
our API so with the third way you can

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,900
just do a purge command or configure

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,459
occupier which is one line on the

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,739
command and will you see a line stand

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,079
for CLI stands for a command line

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,970
interface okay okay just just my feel

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,890
like the feel is making a comeback here

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,970
okay in the last couple years yeah yeah

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,769
so now what when our developers going to

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,959
be looking forward to from Akamai in the

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,639
next year or so because you guys have a

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,500
new emphasis on

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,880
developer outreach and making sure that

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,710
they're aware of everything you have

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,510
available yeah what can they expect from

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,030
you guys know I used to be a developer

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,000
myself and for the last couple years my

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,949
mission has been to really help

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,350
developers be successful and that's why

00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:44,530
we launched our new developer program

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:48,639
recently and that includes more tooling

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:51,250
more SDKs more AP is and just refining

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,090
all the stuff that developers would want

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,729
to use and focusing again really on on

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,870
the developer experience so and the

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,190
other thing we'll be doing is we'll be

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,669
going out on the road you'll see this

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,080
more at conferences like velocity fluent

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,520
and AHS Khan and other third party

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,800
events will be doing a bunch of a lot

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,500
more meetups so you can see and hear a

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,479
lot more from malcolm brog you guys also

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,610
publish quite a bit of content as well

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,130
you have the state of the Internet

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,350
you have some books and we've done some

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,900
bugs in conjunction with a variety of

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,740
partners including O'Reilly we have one

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,889
on HTTP too and high-performance images

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,130
we gave about Dave away a ton of those

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,050
books here at the LA city and people

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,400
just really like loving them so expect

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,410
more of that in the future expect more

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,539
of that yes sir for sure so if you and I

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,539
sit down twelve months from now here in

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,780
San Jose next year what would you like

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:54,430
to say will be change changed for Akamai

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:57,400
because of your developer program you

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,200
will hear more you I mean you'll so

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,880
there's a notion of being a developer

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,680
and there's a notion of being an Akamai

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,810
developer there'll be a better

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,510
understanding of what that is you'll be

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,340
seeing more innovative things from I

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,860
would say a lot of our customers that

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,320
utilize our services we have a new

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,030
mobile sdk you know more traffic's

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,270
moving to mobile and with our new mobile

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,750
sdk that will enable just richer

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,660
experiences and my goal really is to

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,310
reach out to developers and get them to

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,860
understand how to build the amazing

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,889
experiences whether it's desktop

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,740
browsers laptops or even though

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:40,410
and so now things are moving at light

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,600
flux in the lightning speed and we're

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,120
going to be there alongside developer to

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,500
help them deliver amazing experiences
