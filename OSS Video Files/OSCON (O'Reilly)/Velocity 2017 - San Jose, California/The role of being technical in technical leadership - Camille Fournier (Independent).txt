Title: The role of being technical in technical leadership - Camille Fournier (Independent)
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: Velocity 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	There is compelling evidence that technical workers want leaders who are strong technologists, leaders they believe they can learn from. What does this mean for those who wish to become engineering managers and technical leaders? How can you be an effective noncoding technical leader? Camille Fournier explores this conundrum and shares strategies to overcome it.

	00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,600
this talk we're going to discuss a few

00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:09,179
in fluid flow whew overlapping traits

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,219
between individual contributors senior

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,750
engineers and great engineering managers

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,120
these traits what we're going to discuss

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,720
are debugging empathy particularly of

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,100
the technical time and judgments so

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,840
let's start with debugging

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,560
I love debugging debugging is like one

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,080
of my favorite things to do and I think

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,029
that you know as I was growing up in my

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,230
career I think you know most of us have

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,510
to learn how to debug if you're going to

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,890
write code or build systems you're going

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,270
to hit problems there's so many

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,980
different things that can go wrong and

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,180
as you get better and better at writing

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,000
code and writing systems you get better

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,640
and better at finding bugs but for me I

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,110
was curious about more than just the

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,610
bugs and the technology although I was

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,740
curious about that I was curious in all

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,030
kinds of problems why are we doing

00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,470
things this way why are we using this

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,340
process instead of that one why are we

00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:59,400
building this asking why too much is a

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,170
pretty common path for gooding into

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,610
management voluntarily or not you know

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,280
ultimately I believe that it's kind of

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,660
an indication of systems thinking I

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,940
don't love the term system thinking I

00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,740
find it slightly pretentious but really

00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,330
when you're starting to ask questions

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,280
about why we're doing things and why do

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,080
things work this way you're showing an

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,570
interest in the interactions of many

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,180
different complex elements and that's

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,000
what debugging is whether you're

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,770
debugging systems or teams you are

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,920
thinking about many different complex

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,560
elements interacting when I was writing

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,300
the book and first sort of thinking

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,100
about writing it I asked a lot of people

00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,930
for ideas what should I write about

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,040
right and one thing that everyone said

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,100
was you have to write something about

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,300
you know the team is too slow the CEO

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,290
comes to you and taps you on the

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,570
shoulder and says why aren't we getting

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,460
enough done why why are things going

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,620
slowly and this is one of the hardest

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,540
problems as a manager that you will ever

00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,400
do bug and it's hard because there are

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,900
so many different causes that could be

00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,960
happening the team could be unmotivated

00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,430
they could be not gelling yet right they

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,350
could have interpersonal problems on the

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,180
team it could be that you have a process

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,830
problem product is throwing work over

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,539
the fence and the engineering team hates

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,039
it right you can have technical problems

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,590
that are causing the team's to be slow

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,760
as well old code legacy code code that

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,549
really can't be extended quick

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,430
so you have to figure out which of these

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:22,290
things is impacting the ability for your

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,650
team to ship and often it's all of these

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,860
things to differing degrees okay moving

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,060
on to empathy empathy you know I think

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,950
everything is really important for

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,000
senior engineers to possess you need to

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,440
think about who's going to be reading

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,849
your code who's going to be using your

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,349
systems you need to be able to put

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,349
yourself in their shoes to do a really

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,970
good job of creating software and of

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,379
course empathy is important and managers

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,329
you want managers to have certain

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,700
emotional intelligence that ability to

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,290
you know treat people like humans but

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,030
what I'm talking about here is really

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,250
technical empathy so like it or not

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,340
engineers really want their managers to

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,250
be credible we want managers that we

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,450
think maybe could do our jobs maybe we

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,400
just think we can learn something from

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,599
them their domain experts and this is

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,829
actually not just engineers this is

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,109
everyone there was a big study that

00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:12,359
showed that employee satisfaction is

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,720
heavily tied to believing that their

00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,099
boss is highly competent and I'm no

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,379
different I get to work for this guy

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,690
this is Alfred Spector he is the CTO at

00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:23,910
2 Sigma and I'm really excited to work

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,099
for him because he was a professor of

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,410
computer science at Carnegie Mellon he

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,109
ran a company called tranzec for a while

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,599
and he ran Google research before coming

00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,699
to 2 sigma so he is an awesome computer

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,079
scientist and a really great manager and

00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,329
this is great for me I get to learn a

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,280
lot from him but you know we don't

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,440
expect our managers to do a lot of pair

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,870
programming with us right necessarily I

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,549
hope not that's not really a great use

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,980
of most managers time maybe occasionally

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,569
but not all the time we're looking for

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,430
something else I think in our managers

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,049
and I think a lot of what actually

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,310
people are looking for when they are

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,470
looking for technical managers they're

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,269
looking for appreciation someone who

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,340
appreciates the work they're doing

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,680
someone who appreciates the details of

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,540
why what they're doing is difficult you

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,159
can really put themselves into the shoes

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,099
of the team and has some kind of an

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,409
expert's appreciation for the work at

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,239
hand it's much more powerful to be able

00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,340
to tell people well the way you fix that

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,409
bug that was really clever I really

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,419
appreciate that you saw that you know we

00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:23,849
were incorrectly handling those database

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,260
locks whatever is that means a lot to

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,060
people because you can be very specific

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,560
it's much more valuable than you know

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,970
some random stranger on the street

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,050
Hey nice job on that bug you also of

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,180
course need to know what the team's

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,710
going to be excited about there are lots

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,990
of different trends that are always

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,150
happening in tech and knowing what those

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,280
trends are and kind of understanding why

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,210
their trends right now why is react the

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,250
thing that everyone's really excited

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,500
about on the front end and why are

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,720
people you know interested in this

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,060
concept of serverless computing you may

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,830
poopoo them and say s been there done

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,240
that we did that 20 years ago but

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,919
understanding why people are getting

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,480
into that right now and what makes them

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,919
excited about it right now what problems

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,169
it's solving with modern computing is

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,030
important for being able to understand

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,410
that motivations of your team you also

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,540
need to understand their frustrations

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,780
right understanding what makes

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,960
developers hate coming into work whether

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,260
it's you know excessive process tons of

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,030
outages and alerts whatever it is these

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,490
aspects of technical empathy are

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,090
important for motivating and running

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,090
