so we need more safety we need to be

00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,879
in-home people and that's both true from

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,889
an environmental point of view right

00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:14,750
like we need to be nice or to each other

00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:17,960
so I grew up on RC and RC you type in

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,220
caps when you shout right and then when

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,259
you're in person you just keep on

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,099
shouting and then everyone is shouting

00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:26,990
and when you're young and everyone

00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:30,529
around you is also shouting you don't

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,660
really notice that right so you would

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,190
shout shout shout and then someone would

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,130
win and then we'd all go out and talk

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,110
normally until it's time to shout again

00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,610
what I realized is you can't bring home

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,440
new people into that environment because

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,030
they don't actually know when you are

00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,800
shouting because you're just randomly

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,920
shouting or because you're actually

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,220
upset and angry and so it's very very

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,570
hard to come into an environment like

00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:58,340
it's very hard to come into an

00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:02,840
environment that is harsh which a lot of

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,030
an old-school engineering and operations

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,710
environments are I think part of that

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,030
might be that we were like hey we had to

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,079
go through this when we were young so

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,649
now we're going to force everyone else

00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,539
to go through that but that is not

00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:17,119
acceptable

00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:18,560
also this is very important that means

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,030
that when you finally get angry shouts

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,380
no one actually knows that you're now

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,880
finally angry and shouting because

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,630
you've been shouting for no good reason

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,929
for a long time so save that save that

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,969
anger for when you really need it but we

00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:34,460
also need it on technology right like if

00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:36,950
you bit if you leave a red button around

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,539
that destroys the world eventually

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,649
someone's going to press it which is not

00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:45,649
a good for to have right now but like

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,789
schooling is not enough like we need

00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:50,389
more than that why do you need

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:53,060
mentorship you need systems that allow

00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:56,840
people to do things without the risk of

00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,909
massive destruction like otherwise how

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,149
will they learn how can they join right

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,609
so you're used to having 282 instances

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,369
for testing and then you join and

00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:09,740
there's like 20,000 machines or 50,000

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,989
machines or like how do you comprehend

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,459
that once one of my engineers once told

00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:14,810
me when I was trying to interview an

00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,590
operations engineering he's like I don't

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,209
know

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,030
to operate at the empty because when I

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:23,420
joined we gave us like ten servers and

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,239
now we're 505 jongmin 500 I do not know

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,890
how I would have how I would have been

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,319
able to absorb that so I don't know what

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,840
questions to ask and then we grew up

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,080
with it we saw it grow and if you're new

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,860
you don't have that and so we need to

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,620
develop more practice technology to make

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,260
it safer we need to take some of the

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,709
magic that Intel and others keep giving

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,560
us every year and dedicate that CPU

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:55,310
power memory etc to making our

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,989
environment safer they should still be

00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,680
careful but garbage collected languages

00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,680
