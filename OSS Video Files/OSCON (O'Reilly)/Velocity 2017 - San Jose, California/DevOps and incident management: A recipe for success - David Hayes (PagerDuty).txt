	00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,750
so this is a my sixth year at velocity

00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,670
and I love coming to velocity not just

00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,870
because half the audience here has our

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,460
mobile app in their pocket so I don't

00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,740
have to explain what we do but because

00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,660
we're actively involved in figuring out

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,760
what the future of OPS's with you and

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,560
how that moves from being somebody who

00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,180
sits quietly in the back office waiting

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,490
for something to break to somebody who's

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,920
actually involved in scaling up and

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,840
improving the customer experience and we

00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,430
started years ago many of you were with

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,079
us with we're solving the problem of

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,879
meantime to acknowledgment you can't fix

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,399
something if you don't know it's broken

00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:40,629
and we we did that with all the glory

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,789
that but I guess a $10 WordPress theme

00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,989
can get you and if this holds a sweet

00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:45,760
spot in my heart because this is the

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:47,440
last marketing site where the marketing

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,030
team let me do whatever I want with it

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,469
and so we a be tested all of these

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,629
things and we realized that there was an

00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:54,940
actual problem with getting the right

00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:57,159
person every time you had you were

00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,539
carrying an on duty pager but it didn't

00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,620
give you the ability to escalate it

00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:01,030
didn't give you the ability to go off

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,519
call for an hour didn't give you

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,049
visibility into who was on call so we

00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,460
solved that problem for you many of you

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,680
have been with us since the beginning of

00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,090
that journey but it was always in the

00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,040
service of fixing your mean time to

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,570
resolution getting somebody on the

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,090
problem is only the first of many steps

00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,410
towards resolving the problem and so

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,120
over the past couple of years we've

00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,160
introduced a bunch of tools in that

00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,440
space if you're an incident commander

00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,300
looking at multiple services we release

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,610
the operation command console so you can

00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,350
either see a 30,000 foot view of

00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,120
everything that's going on or you can

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,460
dive in and focus on a particular issue

00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,770
or you can see with our infrastructure

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,690
health module what the blast radius of a

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,330
particular problem is what's affected

00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,160
what's upstream pure responder we made

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,230
it easier for you to do all the things

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,780
you need to do to add additional

00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,210
responders to spool up a conference call

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,650
to spool up a chat to add stakeholders

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,480
so that you're proactively notifying

00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,550
them instead of them calling you the

00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,340
ability to embed graphs the ability to

00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,409
embed run books the ability to run

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,000
custom logic from within pages these are

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,260
all exciting things that we're looking

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,790
forward to scaling up and we're always

00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,890
going to be there to improve the

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,840
response to that end we've actually

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,190
started sharing our response

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,899
documentation this has been very popular

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,609
people in this room today have actually

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,950
submitted pull requests against this

00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:16,090
we've started doing training but which

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,489
is all in the service of what

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,860
next we realized talking to the best ops

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,840
teams and and the aspiring vests off

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,550
seems there's a problem that all of you

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,349
have that we're not helping you with and

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,090
I want to think out loud about what

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,550
we're going to do there and it's solving

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,610
your meantime to promotion what do we do

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,830
how do we get you credit for what didn't

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,720
break because if I'm looking at it from

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,269
the outside these two numbers look very

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,950
similar to me but they represent and

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,660
everyone here knows that they represent

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,030
an order of magnitude difference in

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,220
sophistication of your processes of your

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,760
tooling how do we let your boss know

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,560
that you are a five nine team is

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,569
significantly better than a four nine

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,760
team because looking out I don't know

00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,500
who has five nines who has three I don't

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,870
know who somehow convinced their boss

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,180
that planned maintenance windows are an

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,739
acceptable thing to have in 2017 because

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,200
they're not and you can quote me on that

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,549
so we've been we've been rolling out a

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,440
few things we've been dipping our toes

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,269
and one thing I'm surprised to report is

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,310
actually making a difference is in

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,630
ticketing integrations we originally

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,920
rolled this out because executives were

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,049
saying you know what my service now

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,609
tickets are really important I want them

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,500
you know to wake somebody up to 3:00

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:25,209
a.m. you guys do that wake this person

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,799
out we did that but we did it by

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,470
directionally and there's this beautiful

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,480
emergent behavior where the team's and I

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,160
don't want to generalize but nobody in

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,380
this audience likes filing tickets and

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,670
BMC remedy but that's the way the rest

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,910
of the organization knows what you're up

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,920
to

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,239
so by doing that they understand what

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,950
you're up to advise you the air cover

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,709
what you really want to be working on

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,230
which is prevention if we could describe

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,819
what I do at page of duty in a more

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,010
charitable way it's making sure more

00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:52,930
people in this room get to spend more

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,370
dinners with their families we want you

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,350
to use your experience being a

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,940
firefighter to become the best building

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,030
inspector out there and to build a more

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,319
reliable product to that end we're

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,519
making it slightly easier to eat your

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,650
vegetables we're covering them in butter

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,900
we're making opposed we built a

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,850
post-mortem builder right this is we

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,410
talk to the best Ops teams what do you

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,549
do okay we're going to make that super

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,319
easy for everyone to do we're going to

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:17,620
automatically import everything we know

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,180
about imp age of duty or your cut your

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,289
chat tools and we're going to pre

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,840
populate it we're going to ask you some

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,430
simple questions because long term what

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,320
we want to do so we want to get you to

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,030
be a profit Center software is eating

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,919
the world but before it can get to the

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,379
table it needs to go through us

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,360
so you have a meaningful chance to a

00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,219
meaningful obligation to improve your

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,490
customer experience faster deploys

00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:40,840
better tools higher reliability are all

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,520
things that directly influence the

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,669
customers feeling about you how quickly

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,409
they expand how much they buy so what

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,620
we're doing and what we're watching is

00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:52,900
ops transition from this quiet back room

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,509
where people watched blinking lights and

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,539
periodically ran shelke scripts to a

00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,919
world where you're meaningfully figuring

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,749
out the processes you're figuring out

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,490
how to make things faster what tooling

00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:05,529
we can use and we've been calling this

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,759
digital operations management to

00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:08,860
highlight the fact that it's the people

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,259
training the machines to perform better

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,389
rather than the people cleaning up after

00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,060
the machines I work it's a journey that

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,780
we're very excited to be on with you and

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:21,810
we hope you stick with us thanks

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,810
