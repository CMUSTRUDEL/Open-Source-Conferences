	00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,230
now one thing as an industry that we

00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,040
have to come to terms with is this one

00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:15,190
statement I believe the majority of the

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:20,590
people managing infrastructure just want

00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:25,480
to pass there's only one requirement it

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:28,000
has to be built by them no one likes any

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,429
off-the-shelf things the famous last

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,280
words of most people in tech I'm going

00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:37,410
to roll my own and once you do that

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,240
you're setting yourself up for tragedy

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,160
now a lot of people have started to

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,510
think about building their own paths and

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,940
most of the technologies you've been

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,140
hearing about the last couple of years a

00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,810
lot of people are starting to adopt

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,670
things like docker and yes why doctor

00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,410
why is docker becoming the foundation of

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,080
most platforms that people either buy or

00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,700
build and a real reason most Dockers is

00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,340
important for most people is because

00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,860
it's like the first time people decouple

00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,629
their application from the machine all

00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,549
the hype around docker there's real

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,320
benefits and this idea that I can have

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,880
an application that's self-contained is

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,280
where the first stage of portability

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,439
comes into play and then once you start

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,149
to have things in docker it makes it

00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,820
super easy to decide where you want to

00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:21,429
run that but that does not solve all

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,530
your problems anyone here think docker

00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:27,670
solves all their problems I have snake

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:29,049
oil to sell you once you get to docker

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,240
you start to think about the next step

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,700
and this is where most people start to

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,090
examine these cluster management tools

00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,530
like kubernetes or maysa and the goal

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,990
here is that when you adopt one of these

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,549
platforms they'd also be couple you from

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,649
something but this time is the

00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:47,289
infrastructure so once your application

00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:49,149
is the couple from the machine do

00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:50,259
usually the last smile is decoupling

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:51,700
yourself from the underlying

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,670
infrastructure whether that's virtual

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,219
machines a cloud provider your laptop

00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,810
and coverage gives you a new set of

00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,450
abstractions that allow you to kind of

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,240
run that at scale anywhere that you want

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,709
to and people have been running to

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,780
Bernays for a couple of years now in

00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,130
production so it's no longer this new

00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,970
thing that no one knows how to operate

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:17,080
and then those people have learned over

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,270
time to renÃ©e's also has missing pieces

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,490
now it's a much better starting point to

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,230
build a distributed systems or your own

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,980
platform you know all these API is

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,930
built-in but what's missing so when you

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,460
go on and ask people what should I do to

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,290
actually run my applications whether

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,570
it's micro services or monoliths there

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,280
are things that you have to do that we

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,190
mentioned earlier on and then they'll

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,570
recommend products like this nginx will

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,430
deal with things like application

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,140
management and how you get traffic to

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,490
your application you have things like

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,230
open tracing they give you some

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,540
visibility on what's talking to what

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,520
where's your latency and then you have

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,200
things like volt for secrets management

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,030
and all of these things have nice API s

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,250
and Prometheus provides this nice

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,840
adapter to be able to scrape metrics

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,209
from each unique application in your

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,920
stack and then the last box most people

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,120
aren't familiar with that is this new

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,130
project called spiffy

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,660
and what spiffy does is it solves the

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,600
real challenge most people have we're

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,340
all attune to sending secrets to our

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,530
application here's how you connect to

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,240
the database here's how you connect to

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,190
this other thing but the truth is we

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,350
have no identity for any of those

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,330
applications we actually don't know what

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,070
we're sending these things to so things

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,480
like spiffy tried to give identity to

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,350
our applications no matter where they're

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,510
running so once you have all of this you

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,400
start to ask yourself where does SEO fit

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,400
into all of this and just like docker

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,230
and kubernetes the goal is that if do

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,540
doesn't replace those things but it

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,989
integrates with them so that you don't

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,989
have to

00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,879
