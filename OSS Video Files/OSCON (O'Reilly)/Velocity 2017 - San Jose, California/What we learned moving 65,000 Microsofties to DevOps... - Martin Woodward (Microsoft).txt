hi my name is Martin Woodward Martin

00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,459
whoo

00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,740
Microsoft comm is going to send me an

00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:10,630
email if you want to send me some abuse

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,090
on Twitter then at Martin Woodward

00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,280
awesome and Visual Studio comm whack

00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,250
DevOps is where I is where I hang out

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,190
thanks for having me here today so I

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,490
work in sunny Northern Ireland

00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,810
it's a 5,000 miles away I just got a

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,610
phone call as I was about to come on

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,440
stage I've got goats in my back garden

00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,869
apparently that I need to go get sorted

00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,699
out I'm one of these remote workers you

00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:36,269
hear about you know so I've got my

00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:39,789
trousers on today so we're all good I

00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:42,069
joined the company in 2009 through

00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:44,199
acquisition Microsoft bought the the

00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:45,999
startup I was involved in so I went

00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,159
through that whole you know emotional

00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:50,229
rollercoaster of joining a big company

00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,329
having worked in a start-up and got to

00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:55,449
experience what things were like in

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:58,089
Microsoft in 2009 and I've been very

00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:00,909
lucky in that time that I've been able

00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:02,859
to come in and witness three major

00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,510
changes in the culture of the company

00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,920
which has been it's been awesome to see

00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,490
and it's really been a privilege you

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,070
know to work in the company at this time

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,250
so the first shift that we had was a big

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,590
one and I just I work on visual studio

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,729
team services which is our online hosted

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,799
DevOps collaboration tools all the

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,079
things you need to do and that when that

00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,140
came along you know that's a always on

00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,289
cloud service updated several times a

00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,719
day you know it has to stay up we have

00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:36,490
the whole company on it now so if things

00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,530
go down you get phone calls from stature

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,539
and it's not a good times and we need to

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,520
keep the service up and running it's not

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,960
always been that way when I first came

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,759
to the company have actually brought it

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,740
with me we were building shrink wrap

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,789
software like this is how we made money

00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:54,009
we put DVDs into plastic boxes and send

00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,719
them around the world and that gives a

00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,159
very different mindset when you're

00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,409
building the software it's a lot more

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,929
you know waterfalls a lot easier thing

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,759
to fall into worrying about mean time

00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:05,319
between failures is something you do a

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,450
lot because it gets expensive when you

00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,590
need to shred these things and getting

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,850
away and look it's still in the

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,050
shrink-wrap I've never opened it you

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,680
know now we knew the future was hosted

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,329
we knew

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,579
we knew we needed to get towards hosted

00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:21,159
dev tools and we needed to learn how to

00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:24,549
work this way so that's the transition

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:27,760
we've been on here's a picture from

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,439
Daniels story which very much describes

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,790
the journey that what it felt like

00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,069
riding on the back of a fire-breathing

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,109
dragon as we were trying to get this

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,609
software which was always designed to

00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:38,980
work on premise to try and get it

00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:41,709
actually premises so I to try and get it

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,459
to work out in the in the real world of

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,989
the cloud and you know that having said

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,019
that Daniels got quite an idealized

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,609
image of startup life a feel having

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,109
worked in a start-up myself this was his

00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,359
version of a startup journey to the

00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,250
cloud which it's possibly correct the

00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:59,349
thing I don't see on here is when you

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,780
have to keep that bird flying while

00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,639
turning it into an a380 and never you

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,489
know and refuel it at the same time but

00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:11,019
anyway beginnings are easy how give you

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:13,659
that so yeah that whole cloud transition

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:16,030
was something we had to do the next one

00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,599
is you recognize an org chart of some of

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,040
the companies around this area yeah and

00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,650
coming in from the outside the org chart

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,099
of Microsoft felt shockingly familiar to

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,720
me as I was doing in message from Manu

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,510
gonna actually works to put Google just

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,190
across the street and this is actually

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,620
what it felt like you know as an insider

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,389
B were sort of three major divisions for

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,790
the company you had office and Windows

00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,409
and then I was in sort of developer

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,019
tools which is kind of you know this

00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,040
little cousin in the corner and

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,900
everybody had their own systems

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,709
everybody had their own way of building

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:54,030
software and it was quite exciting you

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,260
know it's an interesting thing to do the

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,180
as we were doing this there was really

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,129
not much collaboration and I remember as

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,989
a remote employee during the Windows 8

00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,540
days I actually wasn't even allowed to

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,859
watch videos of demos of Windows 8 I

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,750
wasn't even you know I might look at the

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,609
code I couldn't look at a video of a

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,220
demo of it that's how much things were

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:14,260
there was walls between these orgs than

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,090
no reuse would go and punished so we did

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,810
some analysis and we actually found out

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,970
the other developer time you know most

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,099
of the developer time was spent updating

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,229
the work item tracking software saying

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:26,770
are you nearly done yet which is quite

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,540
fascinating

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,160
luckily SATA came

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,050
we said right you need to pile in and

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,330
you need to actually come in and build

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,830
this software you need to we need to

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,920
that one engineering system for

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,630
everybody to use the final transition

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,270
was that to open-source which has been a

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,610
real privilege now satchi gets a lot of

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,860
a lot of praise you know from the change

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,510
he's had at Microsoft as you can see

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,160
he's gone you know the stock market

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,480
certainly likes him I just want to point

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,290
something out you know that's when I

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,030
joined the company I'm just saying the

00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,800
only thing I've actually can take credit

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,660
for is I did create the github org for

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,560
Microsoft and now we're the largest

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,180
goetaborg

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,830
you know we've got like five really

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,480
major open-source projects lots of open

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,330
source collaboration going on it's been

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,310
a great transition that meant we needed

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,320
to get involved in git and I'll get

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,060
repost gating issues a pretty intense

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,180
that's Linux compared with the software

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,770
I work on compared with Windows yeah so

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,500
we needed to get get working at that

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,570
scale I'll show you how later but may

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,400
majorly what we needed to do we needed

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,320
to do build measure learn you all know

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,450
that we needed to learn how to know that

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,010
we needed to get good experiments we

00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,500
needed to worry about mean time to

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,150
repair which meant we needed to not

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,650
throw things over the wall where you

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,800
know we needed everybody on the same

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,420
team we need to have a live site culture

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,700
if something hurts we have to do it

00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,980
again and again until it stops hurting

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,200
the first time we deployed it took as

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,390
nine months to deploy again the first

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,070
time we went a jille it was six weeks

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,660
sprints and then it was three weeks

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,080
sprints and now we're deploying to

00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,090
production every single day when we're

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,670
looking at customer SLA time we need to

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,490
look at individual customers to see how

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,400
well their systems are performing not

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,410
just the overall service availability of

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,600
entire service what's an individual

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,810
customer experience like does that still

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,430
meet three nines and then finally well

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,530
nearly finally we need to allow the

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,480
smart people to be able to do their own

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,660
solutions we're building the dev tools

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,460
for the entire company we need to let

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,110
them extend those dev tools we need to

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,640
let them come in to our platform and

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,200
build upon it because then they're

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,810
smarter than us you know the old adage

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,580
like the further somebody is from you in

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,720
the org chart the Dumber they are you

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,220
know that's not true

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,140
there's lots of smart people everywhere

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,490
and we need to let them go and then

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,800
finally we need to

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,449
is for the people not the tools we need

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,009
to make sure that our tools are the most

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,349
productive they can be for the people

00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,479
working in them and invest in the tools

00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:56,289
to take them out the way to to make it

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,819
easy for people okay that's kind of a

00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:01,449
preview I'm actually going to be talking

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,650
over in ll 20d later on today and I'm

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,000
going to dig into all the details

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,919
they're actually what we did and some of

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,509
the lessons we learned a bit more but

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,150
thanks very much free time and great to

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,430
see you thank you

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,430
