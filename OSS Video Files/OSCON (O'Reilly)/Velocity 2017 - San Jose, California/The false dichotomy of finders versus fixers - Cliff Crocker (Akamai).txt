Title: The false dichotomy of finders versus fixers - Cliff Crocker (Akamai)
Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: Velocity 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Most tools designed to help you manage your systems fall into two categories: finders, such as monitoring services and log file analyzers, or fixers, such as cloud infrastructure providers or container orchestration. It's up to you to translate information from your finders into actions for your fixers. Cliff Crocker explains how to use intelligent analytics to connect data to actions.

good morning so great to be here

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,610
velocity and Great Debaters speaking

00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,590
with you today my name is cliff crocker

00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,230
and i'm a product leader within Akamai

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,820
I've been attending velocity for all 10

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,099
years now and I'm proud to have made a

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,440
career in performance and reliability I

00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:20,480
love this community and I leave every

00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,760
year feeling more inspired than the last

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,039
however what I've observed in our

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,869
conversations around technology in the

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,240
exhibit halls on these stages in the

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,010
hallway track is that we tend to follow

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,559
a similar dialogue when we talked about

00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:37,700
technology the idea that finding is

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,500
somehow separate from fixing I was

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,020
reminded of this commercial by LifeLock

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,570
an identity theft company by a friend

00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,890
when I was talking about this talk

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,230
essentially there's a bank and a bank

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,489
robbery going on bank robbers run in

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,989
with guns blazing

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:52,520
security guards it's kind of standing

00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:54,440
there all the patrons drop to the floor

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,210
then the patron looks up says well

00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,649
aren't you going to do something so I'm

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,070
not a security guard I'm a security

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,840
monitor admittedly I can relate to this

00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,789
persona for a large part of my career

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,209
I've been focused on one side of the

00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:10,249
problem as a finder we finders are

00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:12,109
represented by technologies focused on

00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,399
efficiently and effectively finding

00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:15,079
problems with performance and

00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,240
availability or other areas of

00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,520
opportunity for optimization this

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,009
includes monitoring availability uptime

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,289
a p.m. log management dashboarding tools

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,749
alerting frameworks all focused on the

00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:28,759
goal of helping you the site owner find

00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:30,679
problems as soon as they happen our

00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,049
primary goals as finders is to reduce

00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:34,789
mean time to problem discovery I've

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,590
related to this category very closely

00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,840
having spent a large part of my career

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,369
in monitoring and testing I would work

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,169
for many organizations and help them

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,889
identify problem areas and hand them

00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:47,389
this golden list of opportunities for

00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:49,009
optimization and enhancement only to

00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:50,569
resurface the next month of that same

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,189
list seeing that they really hadn't done

00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,319
anything month over month over month

00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:56,959
this was continue it's a great business

00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,700
to be in repeat business however not a

00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,809
lot of progress is being made on that

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,999
customers behalf enter the fixer after

00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:06,679
moving to the fixer side I soon found

00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,899
that despite my passion for wanting to

00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:10,429
fix issues the technologies of fixers

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,099
were not always aligned with those of

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,959
the finders specifically feo providers

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,569
content delivery networks tag

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,610
cloud infrastructure seemed to take

00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,920
little-to-no actionable input from that

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,510
of the finder all these fixers have had

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,549
a focus on providing tools and

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,890
infrastructure to help you fix problems

00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:30,110
however there's a tremendous amount of

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,970
work and coordination required in order

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,280
to prioritize the work that needs to be

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,290
done to leverage that technology in a

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,950
way that had the most optimal impact on

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,959
your end users now that leaves you

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,340
sitting here at velocity attempting to

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,720
connect these dots between the

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,389
technologies that find and the

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,879
technologies that fix quite honestly we

00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:51,019
vendors we software vendors this is

00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,700
going to problem we've been guilty of

00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:53,359
enforcing in our chosen fields in the

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,069
community

00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,930
despite the adoption of DevOps

00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:59,000
Automation continuous delivery within

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,569
your organization's that refused to play

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,159
part in this paradigm are these tools

00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,290
vendors and technologists have been slow

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,909
to adapt this new view and there needs

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,420
to be a synergistic relationship between

00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:13,639
these two groups this is why I'm

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,739
ecstatic to be bringing together two

00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,629
fantastic thought leaders onto one great

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:19,519
team as of April this year

00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,500
Akamai a leader in web performance is

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,389
acquired Sosa the leading digital

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,280
performance management company together

00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,470
we're focusing on a new set of

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,159
initiatives and challenges in breaking

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,449
that dichotomy of finders and fixers a

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,519
lot has changed over the last couple of

00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:36,199
years that has made this possible due in

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,609
large part to many of you in the

00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,549
discussions that are coming out of these

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,440
rooms the w3c performance working group

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,479
has worked closely with browser vendors

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,760
to implement timing api's and other

00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,079
capabilities which allow us fine-grained

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,449
visibility and control of our

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,010
applications in the wild meanwhile new

00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,900
standards have emerged for the first

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,970
time in years which are allowing us to

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,750
take huge leaps towards faster and more

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,099
reliable user experiences one of the

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,019
many examples of how we're leveraging

00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,060
these capabilities to provide a great

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,459
experience for your users is with our

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,229
adaptive acceleration offering using

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,909
resource timing data through advanced

00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:13,069
analytics and machine learning we're

00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,169
able to identify critical resources and

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,120
their dependency order with this insight

00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:19,400
we can automate decisions and techniques

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,029
to apply in order to improve the user

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,529
experience using pre connect resource

00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,180
hints we were able to establish

00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:27,800
connections to those external hosts

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,490
including those problematic third

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,530
parties that were

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,389
is talking about we've identified with

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,509
our analytics before we actually need

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,340
them finally we take advantage of server

00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,840
think time and we push resources from

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,470
the edge that we anticipate we're going

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,569
to need for the page this combination of

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,039
technologies both finding opportunities

00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,259
and automating the optimisation

00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:52,000
adaptively results in faster start

00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:54,650
render and an improved user experience

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,120
we are obsessed with this topic and we

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,099
want to hear your thoughts through this

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,020
new family of best-in-class technology

00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,849
we're eager to get to work solving

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,220
problems and having a greater impact on

00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,440
your users please come by and visit our

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,819
booths have a conversation about finding

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,229
and fixing and learning more about this

00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,720
great new team and how we're going to

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,039
adopt these new technologies thank you

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,220
and enjoy the rest of the conference and

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,429
enjoy Tammy coming up here shortly
