hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,609
velocity in fluent in San Jose I'm here

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,960
with Martin Woodward from Microsoft

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,309
Martin how're you doing I'm doing very

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,570
well thank he's been a great show I've

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,070
really enjoyed myself so what if you

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,230
liked about it the level of

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,560
conversations have been fantastic you

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,230
know just talking to people about the

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,150
transition we made in the company from I

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,490
work used to work on a product called

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,359
team foundation server and then we took

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,460
that product and made an online you know

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,949
always on cloud service called visual

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,020
studio team services and we had to go

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,090
for that whole transition of taking you

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,380
know enterprise software kind of because

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,610
it's book very much like an enterprise

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,460
dollar application

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,530
getting it to the cloud and then the

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,079
fascinating thing wasn't actually the

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,730
technological exercise you know the

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,350
classic it actually was a fairly easy

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,980
technology wise even though we went

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,110
straight from an on-premises based

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,430
product to going full pads full platform

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,750
as a service you know breaking out to

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,090
Mike reservist eject properly because we

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,649
needed to scale even though we did that

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,420
the technical bit wasn't the hard bit

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,820
the interesting thing is how we've been

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,040
learning as an organization to become

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,930
live site orientated to become service

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,430
orientated and a completely different

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,360
way of work and it's been a fascinating

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,549
experience report changes and pixels and

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,799
new versions yeah yeah continuously

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,200
continuously or what you know and

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,210
obviously that's where we are now that's

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,970
not where we started you know we did our

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,740
first deployment thinking right we're

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,570
going to be always on cloud service did

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,100
our first deployment and then right

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,439
right Steve an extra you know nine

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,740
months later we find a figure and we're

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,710
on the the delivery software method that

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,030
had been around when we cut CDs and well

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,049
that's where I came back to the history

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,640
I mean that's where a lot of the

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,350
organization came from as well you know

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,990
used to learning it and that's very much

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,119
of a mindset around mean time between

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,530
failures because it's expensive to shred

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,350
CDs and things if you have a ship

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,899
stopping book but now when you're in an

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,130
online service you've got to fully you

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,750
know you should be mean time between

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,460
failure you know you should have a

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,270
mindset that is how do we deliver

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,829
quickly but it takes a long time to to

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,050
know that you should do that and to

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,430
actually internalize and be able to do

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,290
it as an organization

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,359
so we've got to go through that change

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,879
we've gone from shipping every you know

00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:19,920
we then go enter shipping every few

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,750
weeks to the enter ship every three

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,340
weeks so now we're we ship into

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,959
production multiple times a day so

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,810
you're living what you're providing your

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,629
partners yeah and and we provide it to

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,430
customers we we use visual studio team

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,079
services to deploy visual studio team

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,819
services because it's before you know

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:38,219
source control work I'm tracking we

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,290
release management so we use that but

00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,510
not only do we use it ourselves for

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,109
customers you know people with real jobs

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,700
and like us all of Microsoft are on it

00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,950
so we've just been for a big transition

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,919
where we've taken it's now sixty nine

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,900
thousand engineers inside Microsoft and

00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,810
got them on to visual studio team

00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,939
services so going from there proprietary

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,409
build systems practically everything and

00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,299
every organization in Microsoft had

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,219
their own way of doing things and try

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,650
and getting all those people moved onto

00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,000
one cloud hosted system where you're not

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,030
throwing it over the fence to the other

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,479
group yeah yeah exactly where we're

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,680
running it in a proper DevOps way and

00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,900
what's been fascinating about that is

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,699
while they're not part of the team that

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,440
run the service we still have to involve

00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,930
them there's still internal stakeholders

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,400
and you know if you hold up a Windows

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,959
release people get shout here yeah

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
inside Microsoft you know it's kind of

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,859
important similarly with office and

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,209
things and even minecraft you know it's

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,459
a lot people want their Minecraft phones

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,049
yeah minecraft reusing VSDs so you know

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,519
we need to get these out as well so and

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,049
despite what I would say it fills in

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,139
organizations if you're in a big company

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,759
and it always feels like the further

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,530
somebody is from you in the org chart

00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,810
the more stupid they are you know it's

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,519
how it feels and it's not true obviously

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,620
there's a lot of smart people everywhere

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,810
and so we have to make sure when we

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,509
bring them onto the platform we have to

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,040
do a lot of work around extensibility so

00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,139
that people could build plugins and

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,129
extensions and very deep integrations

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:10,769
into the core developer tools

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:13,470
collaboration services so that if they

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,109
wanted something to do work a certain

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,970
way they've got two choices now they can

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,680
send us a pull request because we have

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,320
in a source inside Microsoft now which

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,250
we never had before so any engineering

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,330
group consent

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,890
the poor request to any other

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,140
engineering group if they want to submit

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,390
to Borg or submit a feature I think but

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,370
what we tend to do is we have an

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,200
extensibility model so if the windows

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,750
team really wanted to invest in a

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,800
particular dashboard or a particular

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,860
type of feature or a particular

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,860
integration with their telemetry systems

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,100
and things like that then they can build

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,990
those and we give them the hooks to

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,520
build them in in because that's not a

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,590
feature that we necessarily want to

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,730
invest in for everybody or to send to

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,740
consumers you know singlets very

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,970
specialized but it's your inner source

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,100
are they

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,460
open source tools you know sourced or

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,900
they just all your tools inner source

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,480
the whole of the Microsoft code base is

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,419
now in a source ok so I can go and look

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,370
and grab a piece of Windows yes yeah I

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,560
can write work and what with visibility

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,270
into it or visibility into it I don't

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,010
have a commit right time right cuz it in

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,430
a sauce and that was actually an

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:23,220
interesting mindset change we had to go

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,800
in through with the company because we

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,050
had to go through a point where they

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,700
were used to access to source control

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,760
went full access you just didn't

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,500
exercise it and we're now we're working

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,250
in you know an open source style

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,250
workflow but inside the firewall so you

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,919
are there are restricted read

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,870
permissions but book permissive sorry

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,700
restricted write permissions but

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,500
permissive read permissions right so

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,300
everybody can read the source code I can

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
read notepad source code and figure out

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,970
what's going on figure out what's going

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,780
on figure out what the issue is I can

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,820
submit a pull request to because maybe I

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,470
want to finally add UNIX line ending

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,270
support into notepad you know I can do

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,550
that I can cement that pull request for

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,650
one no actually I've looked at this as a

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,780
hobby you know as you do because it's

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,280
sorted okay yeah exactly why not it

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,780
turns out that that was really hard to

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,729
do and would have impacted a bunch of

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,110
systems and turns out you know the

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,700
reason why they haven't done that is

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,350
because of all the knock-on impacts in

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,630
terms of the way that the dimensions are

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,160
set up it isn't because the team that

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,930
run notepad were idiots it's because it

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,610
was a hard problem whoo go figure you

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,840
know and that's generally the case that

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,300
happens so but we needed this

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,780
extensibility model and the interesting

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,650
thing about inner source this has come

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,509
along at the same time so my only

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,180
claim to fame really inside of Microsoft

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,400
it's such a big company it's very hard

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,229
to know if you as an individual ever

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,210
done anything you know you just a cog in

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,030
your car exactly yeah because you just

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,590
especially the you know glorified middle

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,000
manager you know I mean a delete a lot

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,259
of email and you know make some

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,720
PowerPoint slides but what I'm actually

00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:59,180
really doing the one thing I can claim

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,650
my claim to fame now is I was the person

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,600
that created Microsoft skippable

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,800
clacking to me ran off my credit card

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,150
for a little while and I had to expense

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,590
it you know so I got that set up and now

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,539
with the biggest get or being with the

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,800
biggest open source organization on the

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,810
planet now we've got the highest number

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,330
of contributions we've got say the top

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,830
five opens in some of the top yet five

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,990
of the top 10 open source projects and

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,570
things so it's a very you know very

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,300
active presence in the open-source

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,650
community and that was a huge culture

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,650
change we had to go through as a company

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,660
as well but then seeing this things

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,490
we're learning from learning how to work

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,139
with open source seeing those

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,880
translating to culture changes in the

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,669
company with how we work with each other

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,110
and adopting those collaboration models

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,669
inside the business as well as outside

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,020
the business it's just been a great

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:47,780
transition so do you think that culture

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,300
change has made people people happier

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,090
Microsoft in their job so yes there's

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,740
two things that make people happy that

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,300
being able being able to influence me

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,000
answer you know fix things and the

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,250
applications definitely and working in

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,080
this inner source or opens an open

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,849
source hugely makes them happier

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:11,150
especially open source because we we

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,320
very deliberately set it up so when

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,080
people contribute to open source

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,240
projects on github they do so with their

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,610
personal accounts now we have some

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,099
tooling set up inside the company which

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,380
is open sourced which allows them to

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,960
associate their github identity with

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,030
their Microsoft identity so we know who

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,949
they are as a person and then that also

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,560
allows them to get access to certain

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,150
github repos based on where they are in

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,520
the org chart and things so we have that

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,050
tooling set up and that Salling also

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,789
does things like make sure they set

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,050
Microsoft in their company name so that

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,010
we're transparent about where this

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:48,110
contribution is coming from but the as

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,089
they're doing these contributions into

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,680
github it just helps them you know

00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:53,959
understand how to work and it builds up

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,999
against their personal profile and it

00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,379
makes them you know look at this awesome

00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:59,029
stuff I have done and I work most of

00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,949
them doing awesome and it makes them

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:04,610
feel more successful the other thing

00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:06,709
that they're really enjoying is and it

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,019
was proved there was data in there lady

00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:12,499
stackoverflow survey 2015 Stack Overflow

00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:14,059
survey they basically have correlated a

00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:16,790
happy developer as a developer that

00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:19,519
ships frequently so them so the

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,709
check-in/check-out model is it ship to

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,300
shipping or ticket being having a custom

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,069
you use your stuff not just checking in

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,449
checking checkout blah whatever so that

00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:28,910
doesn't make sense yeah we've had that

00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:30,529
River yeah the actually shipping

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,360
software and getting into custom hands

00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,300
the shorter time your mean time to

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,920
release is the shorter time you can you

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,870
know time for null ship well the thing

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,999
the short of that is that quickie or

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,649
iteration cycles are the happier

00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:45,589
developers are the more likely they are

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,730
to stay with you and so and this is you

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,939
know we've actually got data this is

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,589
what we've kind of known it's fun it's

00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:53,329
so much fun getting people to use your

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,889
software we kind of know that will

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:56,269
actually sort of seen you know actual

00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,639
data that backs us up that which is

00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:01,540
awesome so Martin if if you and I sit

00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:04,220
down yeah next year here yeah

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,649
what would you like to say Microsoft is

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,050
doing even better than your journey that

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,999
you've already been on Wow where would

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:16,699
you like to see the organization next

00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:18,350
year time yeah so we need to get better

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:23,329
at doing open source we're doing a good

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:25,249
job today we're making we set up our

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:28,429
reward structure inside the company to

00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:30,439
make it such that people actually it's

00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:31,339
in their favor to contribute back to the

00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:33,259
open-source community

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,550
yeah because they have to because if

00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,519
they're not contributor it's not for

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,829
karma or whatever it's a pure business

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,689
sense if you're not contributing back to

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,850
an open-source library you're consuming

00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:47,660
then you're forking further and further

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,220
away and it's basically it's like a it's

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,019
an integration credit card debt you're

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,819
building up here and if you don't bring

00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,370
that that if you don't push your stuff

00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,569
up you can't bring that code back and

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,189
then you're not getting the free feature

00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,089
so why we're using open source in the

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:01,189
first place why didn't just build

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,110
yourself you know so anyway we encourage

00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,649
people to do that I like to get better

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,670
at doing

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:09,589
and source generally more making sure

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,540
some projects are very transparent

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:16,579
instant you know ones that we run other

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,689
projects tend to be less involving of

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:19,309
their communities you know the

00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:21,709
publishing under an open-source license

00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:24,709
and they're taking pool requests but do

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:26,990
they have community ownership of it so

00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,329
yet do some more of that and then the

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,540
other area is around in a source there's

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:34,999
a lot more features we can add to make

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,139
the coding experience inside of

00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:40,790
companies more social helping with you

00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:42,379
know learning from the pool request

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,740
models and things that we support within

00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:49,369
visual studio team services making sure

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,889
that it's easier to contribute to things

00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:54,199
making sure it's easy to to take Forks

00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,879
and then to integrate Kobach so one last

00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:58,129
question I'm very curious about this

00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,459
like with your inner sources yes have

00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:03,410
you guys done any Studies on are the

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,879
people who are checking in code checking

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,670
in better code now than they used to

00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,050
because so not where we haven't done

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,179
that that we haven't on our data within

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,179
a source however we have done that with

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,660
anecdotally with open source I see it

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,850
all the time yeah interesting to have

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,850
some rumors yeah yeah yeah yeah we

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,439
should look at their measurements so I

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,449
helped a lot of groups open source stuff

00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:28,490
inside the company and the classic

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:30,230
conversation I have with engineers is

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,300
you know we come into open source oh

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,699
hang on let me just refactor that for

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,899
six months you know any night dude this

00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,300
codes been shipping on eight billion

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,920
devices with ten years then that is it

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,929
not good code oh no no it's great code

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,100
we'll ship it and business hole that

00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,350
because it is against their personal

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,970
reputation as well there's this whole

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,939
emotional thing about letting other

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,860
people see it the other thing that it

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,199
stops people from doing is you know we

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,970
have deadlines we have you have a show

00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,949
coming up you have a release to hit you

00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,329
have a date to hit sometimes when you

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:01,910
get those deadlines you want to like

00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,619
check in you know some code you wouldn't

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,730
normally check in we were to do because

00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:06,019
you know you're going to come back to it

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,610
and then you know you never do what yeah

00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,660
but to do that these two do's we found

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,200
in the code base that I've been there

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,080
for 15 years you know it's it anyway

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,220
so um you do that you can't get away

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,500
without when you're open sourcing

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,080
something because because the community

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,730
when we open sourced a net we don't

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,550
consider think truly open source until

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,750
the Deb's are actually you know when

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,880
they open source it they're no longer

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,530
working in team services they're working

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,540
on github that and that's where they

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,160
work so when they do a pull request they

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,610
do a pull request into the open source

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,410
repository we don't you know that's

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,420
where code reviews happen so if you're

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,190
contributing to dotnet you follow the

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,360
same process as somebody on the dotnet

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,410
team does Roach's how you do open source

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,790
so when they do that they get people

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,980
commenting on pull requests and things

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,860
and they don't want you know somebody

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,270
like so we have you know Microsoft

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,620
obviously huge contributors are not

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,390
matter but Google or a big contributor

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,730
to dotnet now you know Intel or a big

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,500
contributor dotnet Samsung are and what

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,090
you don't want is a c-sharp developer

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,860
you don't a check in a pull request and

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,390
then have John skeet pile in and say

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,350
you're an idiot that's terrible code you

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,090
know nobody would because there's an

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,080
awfully nice guy well you don't want you

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,700
know you've got all these people from

00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,620
Google different companies and from the

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,320
community and you want to check in code

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,580
which is good and so yeah we find

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,830
anecdotally we find people definitely

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,450
consider it a lot more we have the

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,280
instance II what data we can get yeah

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,730
well I look forward that conversation in

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,840
four months

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,840
thank you very much for having me

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,120
