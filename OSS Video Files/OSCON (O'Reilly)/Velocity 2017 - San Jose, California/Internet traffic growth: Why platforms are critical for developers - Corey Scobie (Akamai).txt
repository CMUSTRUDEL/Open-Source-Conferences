	00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,420
I'm so excited to be here to talk to you

00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:05,920
about something that I'm really

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,559
passionate about which is making the

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,869
internet great for developers so the

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,429
story starts with the future and our

00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:14,530
expectations and when it comes to the

00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:19,720
future the internet our expectations are

00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:21,279
truly enormous we crave speed we're not

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,949
we're just not patient anymore when it

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,179
comes to Internet experiences instant

00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:31,210
responses or move on quality is

00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:33,160
absolutely essential we survive for a

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,870
long time without HD but now that we

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,940
have it we can't live without it and the

00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,190
bar continues to be raised once you've

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:44,670
seen your favorite content in 4k there's

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:47,260
no going back it has to scale globally

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,750
more and more people are getting

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,970
connected every single day and more

00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,490
applications are coming online traffic

00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,270
continues to grow at enormous rates and

00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,880
we've got to be ready

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,750
the internet has to work and I mean

00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,960
always

00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,220
there's simply no room for error every

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,810
minute a site app or video is

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,640
unavailable your brand is both losing

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:18,400
dollars and reputation and we

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,350
desperately need security it seems like

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,930
everything is getting hacked there's a

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,700
new headline every single day if you get

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:29,230
hacked you're going to be answering to

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:32,020
your customers about what happens now

00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,090
more than ever before the ecosystem that

00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,030
we employ for our internet experiences

00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:40,360
have to be quick to deploy and quick to

00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,729
change DevOps is driving the new bar in

00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,440
rapid systems integration for internet

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:49,330
applications so the core problem is that

00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,270
the internet was never designed or built

00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,760
for these kinds of characteristics the

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,369
original requirements emphasized

00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,409
interoperability resilience and a strong

00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,990
separation of concerns between the

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,970
infrastructure architecture and the

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,330
applications running on top of it in

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,979
fact some of these limitations with the

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,779
Genesis for the creation of things like

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,779
content delivery networks to begin with

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,400
there is one single entity that can

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,470
deliver on all these enormous

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,680
expectations it's going to take all of

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,720
us together to do that think about the

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,180
challenge of replacing broadcast TV with

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,210
live streaming video at the new standard

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,580
of 4k quality if hundreds of millions of

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,770
viewers switched over tomorrow the core

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,650
of the Internet is short of capacity by

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,500
several orders of magnitude we need new

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,340
technology and new platforms to solve

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,040
this problem

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,660
how about delivering coverage of world

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,810
events to billions of users

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,400
simultaneously we need better solution

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,640
for on-demand events that require

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,420
extraordinary global scale and of course

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,850
there's always the increasingly hostile

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,120
digital threat landscape all of these

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,410
challenges and many more will require a

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,140
coordinated approach for how to fuse the

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,290
infrastructure and software of the

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,640
interne these are the infrastructure and

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,770
software into the Internet of the future

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,630
so the good news is that there's already

00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,390
some great examples of innovations that

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,940
are much more tailored to the needs of

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,430
next generation developers take http/2

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,950
as an example it was a decade-long

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,660
collaboration to evolve the primary

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,080
protocol of the internet and it was the

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,150
first major revision in 15 years but it

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,260
provides many more benefits to modern

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,400
app developers and experienced designers

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,070
quick is another example of a

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,450
foundational internet technology that is

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,890
more closely coupled to the

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,890
characteristics that application

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,410
developers require developers need a low

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,140
latency channel to connect users and

00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:00,489
systems and quick is a path to meet that

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,980
that need the next generation of

00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:05,050
security implementation requires a

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,120
complete reimagine ation of the

00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,850
architecture of certificate authorities

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,060
of transports of integration with

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,610
browsers and of apps and sites the new

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,250
TLS standard is built on the assumption

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,560
that all content will be encrypted even

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,479
things that are public security at this

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
scale will continue to be a significant

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,780
challenge but commitment and

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
collaboration across the internet

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,360
community to make it

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,670
reality akamai publishes us quarterly

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,150
state of the Internet report this report

00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,310
details population and connectivity

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,020
characteristics from around the globe

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,910
from this data it's easy to see that the

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,070
foundational characteristics of today's

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,750
internet is not sufficient to carry us

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,010
forward to the next generation of apps

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,460
and experiences the traditional

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,110
compartmentalization of Internet

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,270
technology and app development will not

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,730
sustain our aspirations going forward

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,770
next gen builders will need an internet

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,860
that's more closely coupled to the kinds

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,420
of experiences they want to deliver a

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,820
platform for modern Internet development

00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,700
the balls in our Court to rise to that

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,320
challenge so I'd like to ask all of you

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,090
to take on that challenge in the next

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,340
couple of days connect with your

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,730
colleagues your friends even strangers

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,080
and take a moment over the next course

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,760
of the next couple days to talk about

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,400
the Internet of the future and what

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,700
you'd like out of it and get working on

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,440
that collaboration so with that I'm done

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,310
but I'd ask for your indulgence for one

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,730
last second today is my birthday okay

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,670
and if you don't mind I'd like to take a

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,380
selfie of me in the crowd so that when

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,720
people ask me what I did on my birthday

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,990
I can tell them I spoke to this amazing

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,990
audience

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,010
thanks so much I won't be able to tag

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,310
you all on Twitter but I'll give it my

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,310
