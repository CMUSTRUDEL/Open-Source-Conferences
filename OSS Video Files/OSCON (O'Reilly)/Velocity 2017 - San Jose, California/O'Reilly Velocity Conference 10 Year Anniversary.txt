	00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:07,319
in July of 2006 I wrote a blog post

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,469
called operations the new secret sauce

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,210
the key line in that post was that in

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,920
the future being a developer on

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,080
someone's platform would mean being

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,940
hosted on their infrastructure and so I

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,980
became fascinated with the way that

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,350
there were people inside modern web

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,960
applications not just code we really

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,529
needed an event like this and that we

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,300
were a community without a home and so

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:37,559
we're here today to start building that

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:41,520
community and hopefully this is the this

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,579
is the 10th velocity conference so 10

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,070
years of telling a story about web

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,500
operations and performance it was this

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,289
great moment in time where we were

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,719
starting to move into the cloud era what

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,879
was once an oddity a few big companies

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,520
that were building these amazing web

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,100
applications is now the texture and the

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,339
substance of our entire digital economy

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,970
so this really new profession was born

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,979
and we really brought together this

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,110
group of people in order to celebrate

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,820
that profession and to help those people

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,210
to teach each other and to learn from

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,229
each other the people who are inside the

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,570
applications of today they are the one

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:26,520
indispensable part of every modern

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,579
business

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,579
