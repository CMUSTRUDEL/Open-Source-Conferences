Title: Real-time AI for entity resolution, Jeff Jonas (Senzing)
Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2019 - London, UK
Description: 
	Entity resolution—determining “who is who” and “who is related to whom”—is essential to almost every industry, including banking, insurance, healthcare, marketing, telecommunications, social services, and more. Unlike traditional AI and machine learning that require enormous amounts of training data, new incremental learning algorithms work out of the box without training or tuning. Then in real time the algorithms get smarter without any reloading.
Jeff Jonas details how you can use a purpose-built real-time AI, created for general-purpose entity resolution, to gain new insights and make better decisions faster.

	00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:08,830
this next one is fundamentally the most

00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,150
important for catching clever bad people

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,369
take a look at ten and figure out where

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,869
it belongs now what most people do is

00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:17,150
record matching you're comparing it to

00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,039
record one and going nope not enough

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,380
info what about comparing its record -

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,990
nope not enough info and what you'll

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,169
find is there's no single record that

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,689
has enough info but if you knew in

00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:31,759
inside of any de one that records one

00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:36,890
two six and eight and you knew all the

00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:41,000
phones all the emails dates of birth all

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:44,989
combined into that one persona you can

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,670
match record ten in there if you can't

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,879
do this you can't catch clever bad

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,010
people because clever bad people never

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,890
use the same name address phone and

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:58,550
passport on every record only the idiots

00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,789
do that we call this entity centric

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,580
learning now what if you delete a record

00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:05,780
like for gdpr

00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,790
right to be forgotten you have to

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,420
unlearn earlier assertions so in real

00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,240
time you have to be able to pop it out

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,620
so if you delete eight six pops out and

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,340
you become uncertain of ten and that

00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,340
pops out as well

00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,750
