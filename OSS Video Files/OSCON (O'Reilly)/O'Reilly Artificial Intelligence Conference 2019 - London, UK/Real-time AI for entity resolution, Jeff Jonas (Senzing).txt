Description: 
	Entity resolution—determining “who is who” and “who is related to whom”—is essential to almost every industry, including banking, insurance, healthcare, marketing, telecommunications, social services, and more. Unlike traditional AI and machine learning that require enormous amounts of training data, new incremental learning algorithms work out of the box without training or tuning. Then in real time the algorithms get smarter without any reloading.
Jeff Jonas details how you can use a purpose-built real-time AI, created for general-purpose entity resolution, to gain new insights and make better decisions faster.
