	00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,099
it's becoming increasingly obvious that

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,990
almost every business has to become a

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,220
technology-driven business in order to

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,660
thrive and data has rapidly become one

00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,050
of the most powerful sources of

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,669
competitive differentiation and as we

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,320
are looking towards more demanding

00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:25,349
applications of artificial intelligence

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,569
in order to unlock the value of our data

00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:29,759
it's important that we consider the

00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,009
impact of these demanding workloads on

00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,800
our infrastructure and other investments

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,660
that we make think millions of

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,300
concurrent calculations happening on top

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,490
of hundreds of terabytes to hundreds of

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,290
petabytes and in some cases that we are

00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,480
directly involved in thousands of

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,400
petabytes worth of data which is why

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,520
it's important that we develop

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,040
sustainable strategies around managing

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,520
big data and scaling artificial

00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,020
intelligence initiatives appropriately

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,150
there are some key principles that we

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,120
need to consider for operational

00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,400
sustainability for instance the same

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,530
consistent view of the data should be

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,620
made available to multiple data science

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,750
teams without duplication so that we can

00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,690
avoid increasing costs unnecessarily

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,640
each team should be given access to

00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,520
their own isolated environments so that

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,409
they can work on different projects

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,570
using different frameworks tool sets and

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,590
libraries but on the same data at the

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,330
same time and during the lifecycle of

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,270
these projects teams will need to have

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,840
access to varying degrees of resources

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,729
therefore very rigid boundaries should

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,460
be avoided between these environments

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,560
and as it was mentioned earlier security

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,630
is of course very important not just

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,970
from a data loss prevention perspective

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,030
but also from the perspective of

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,850
preventing other sophisticated attacks

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,010
that might be impacting the integrity of

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,470
the data in subtle ways poisoning the

00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,460
model development and the training

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,350
process and finally multi cloud platform

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,659
agnostic operating models are becoming

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,090
increasingly important to the world of

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,300
artificial intelligence intrinsic

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,130
security and consistent governance and

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,180
control over consumption of resources

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,750
across

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,349
multiple platforms is vital to continued

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,109
productivity there are many

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,200
organizations that adopt a

00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:31,049
do-it-yourself approach but your point

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,150
of value isn't in your IT departments

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,120
making individual technical and

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,980
component level decisions

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,230
differentiation is found in creating

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,750
environments where you can fail faster

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,939
when you can explore without fear of

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,359
losing too much time and exploring new

00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,500
different learning opportunities and

00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:51,450
where you can accelerate time to

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,909
productivity and time to insight which

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,609
is why many of you start your journeys

00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,780
in the cloud leveraging for instance

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,840
machine learning as a service

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,230
consumption models what we find is that

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,719
due to data proximity and gravity issues

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,060
potentially regulatory or compliance

00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,069
requirements or basic cloud economics

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,840
some of our customers find it

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,000
challenging to scale their error

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,060
initiatives beyond a certain point in

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,549
the cloud and this is why at Dell

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,829
technologies we have developed our AI

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,260
ready architectures these are pre

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,079
validated solutions designed by data

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,239
scientists for data scientists for the

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,180
sole purpose of maximizing time to

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
productivity and time to insight on on

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,560
premises based deployments these

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,409
solutions also integrate with

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,199
third-party ecosystems and cloud

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:47,090
providers to complement a multi cloud

00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:50,180
operating model our solutions are also

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,370
supported by our AI advisory services

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,189
services such as data cleansing use case

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,509
validation or education services for

00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,560
those organizations that might be

00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:04,979
impacted by skill shortage issues if

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,349
you'd like to find out more I'd like to

00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,959
encourage you to attend my colleagues

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:13,319
session Thomas Hanson Thomas will be

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,790
presenting at 11:55 Park suite he will

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,530
be discussing the practical

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,690
considerations that you need to take

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,759
into account when scaling your AI

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,009
initiatives from proof-of-concept to

00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,080
full-on production ization if you've got

00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,230
additional questions my colleagues are

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,550
also available at booth 210

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,590
and we'll be more than happy to answer

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,970
your questions without I'd like to thank

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,940
