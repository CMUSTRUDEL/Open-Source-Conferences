so let's look at texts these days the

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,620
favorite approach is to use some massive

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,440
off-the-shelf model pre-trained on lots

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,369
of data so for example open a I released

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,570
a version of their GPT to model with

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,520
over 800 million parameters but now

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,829
researchers and practitioners are also

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,110
beginning to understand that you need to

00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,110
infuse these models acknowledge or tune

00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,720
them for your specific application

00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,379
domains so the objective is to build a

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,149
machine reading comprehension system and

00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:41,839
just like in self-driving cars where you

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,190
have predetermined levels of autonomy

00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:47,820
progress in terms of machine reading

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,309
will happen in stages so right now we're

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,440
in the simple notification and FAQ

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,559
assistance but over time they'll become

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,359
more personalized and we'll have

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,489
autonomous assistance now we have

00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,210
numerous sessions and texts including

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:07,979
tasks from people in healthcare finance

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,810
media and more now what about pre train

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,030
models for speech there are a few

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,610
reasons why one-size-fits-all speech

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,409
model hasn't quite yet materialized you

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,780
know a spoken language is just not as

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,880
precise as written text and even if you

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,159
have access to the best speech to text

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,630
technology available you often end up

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,439
with a document the sentences that

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,219
contain pauses filters restarts

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,540
interjections and ungrammatical

00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,000
constructs that make it very difficult

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,829
but even with these challenges there are

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,200
many areas where speech has grown in

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,299
recent years for example comScore

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,210
estimates that estimates that by the end

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,130
of 2020 but half of all online searches

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,560
will use voice which is pretty

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,930
remarkable and smart speakers are

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,210
expected to grow by more than 82 percent

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,609
from 2018 to 2019 and by the end of the

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,490
year the installed base for such devices

00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:58,490
is expected to exceed 300 million

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,130
