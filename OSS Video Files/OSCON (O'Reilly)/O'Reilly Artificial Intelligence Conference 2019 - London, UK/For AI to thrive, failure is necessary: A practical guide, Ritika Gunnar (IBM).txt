Title: For AI to thrive, failure is necessary: A practical guide, Ritika Gunnar (IBM)
Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2019 - London, UK
Description: 
	Across industries, AI is viewed as the key to transforming organizations and fundamentally changing the way people work. However, adoption of AI has been slow, and there is a misconception that if you aren’t immediately successful, then your AI strategy doesn’t work. However, the truth is, in order for AI to thrive within an organization, it first needs to fail. Failure allows organizations to rethink and rework how they approach data, processes, and culture.
Ritika Gunnar explores why you need to focus on your organization’s culture and build a data-first approach to shape a strong, AI-ready organization.
This keynote is sponsored by IBM Watson.

	00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,580
in my role over the past years I've had

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:12,179
the opportunity to be able to spend a

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,150
number of a lot of time with numerous

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,460
different clients across every industry

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,320
across every geography and we've had a

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,230
lot of learnings in terms of what does

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,390
it mean for AI to thrive inside of their

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,890
organizations and today we want to be

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,130
able to walk through what it really

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,940
takes but as you can see from the title

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,680
here failure is necessary and you may

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,170
not think about it that way but I'm

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,390
gonna walk you through why failure and

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,870
experimentation is absolutely critical

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,520
to be successful with your AI projects

00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,650
yeah I want to start out by taking a

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,710
look at what most people think of in

00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:53,400
terms of AI we often get a view that AI

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,730
is this mythical magical creature this

00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,560
black box that is going to give you

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,190
instantaneous answers and value creation

00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,450
and drive wealth for your organization's

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,769
how many of your organization's think

00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,020
that how many of your businesses believe

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,950
by implementing AI everything is going

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,789
to be perfect

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,869
many of you right but the reality is is

00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:18,509
that AI is not magic AI is computer

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,939
science and is math and statistics it is

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,159
your domain knowledge and through the

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,289
processes that you guys have implemented

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,130
in your own organizations and through

00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:32,939
mass experimentation a number of your AI

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,670
projects will fail but those that will

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,240
succeed will have a significant impact

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,529
on business and the new business models

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,039
that get created in your organization ai

00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:50,549
will create almost 16 trillion dollars

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:54,090
in the global economy over the next

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,859
decade by 2030 I want you to think about

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,990
that because that's probably one of the

00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,840
most meaningful things that will happen

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,659
in the next decade that everybody in

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,399
this room will be a part of with its

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,000
ability to be able to impact

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,769
personalization and productivity

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,819
artificial intelligence will impact

00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:15,730
every business every organization large

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,370
and small

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,430
regardless of what industry you're in

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,480
and you know many organizations are

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,060
trying to figure out what does it

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,260
actually mean for us to implement AI and

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,230
in a meaningful and an impactful way AI

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,730
in the enterprise is truly about three

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,190
things when we've done a lot of our

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,489
studies we find it's really about having

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,500
better better information to be able to

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,540
have better outcomes and better insights

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,360
to have predictions better predictions

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,880
better automation and better

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,130
optimization let's go into this in a

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,890
little bit more detail when it comes

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,440
down to it those three things are really

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,019
about unlocking the power of data that

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,690
exists data that exists within the

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,780
firewalls of your own organization data

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,120
exists that exists with public data and

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,400
syndicated data whether it's about doing

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,930
better predictions like Experian where

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,079
you're actually figuring out how to

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,470
predict where fraud occurs or predict

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:20,079
false positives or use predictions to be

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,510
able to assume where risk exists in an

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,510
organization whether it's actually

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,090
taking deep knowledge workers like in

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,950
the legal profession where legal Nation

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,010
has actually made the task of creating

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,250
contracts and taking that from today

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,160
what is a multiple day to multiple hour

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,859
process down to minutes allowing the

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,069
actual lawyers within an organization to

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,959
focus on the job that they do best or

00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,239
whether it's like Woodside where they're

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,459
actually taking all the knowledge that

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,430
exists within the technical engineers in

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,630
their organization and they're

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,130
automating the knowledge at the

00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,260
fingertips of even some of the most

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,299
senior engineers so they can be just as

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,440
good as engineers that have been out in

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:08,620
the field for a number of decades these

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,470
are examples of how AI unlocks value of

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,840
data in totally new ways and the last

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,570
example is really taking data that

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,049
exists out there and providing a new way

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,690
to be able to provide cardiac care for

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:27,419
remote regions of impoverished areas

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:29,380
such as India Africa and other areas

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,850
when you take a look at all

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,910
three of those examples of better

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,880
predictions better optimizations and

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,220
better automation it really isn't just

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,260
about the technology artificial

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,720
intelligence is absolutely important in

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,270
terms of the technology and the models

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,730
and what it means to actually create

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,990
better types of outcomes from the actual

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,880
underlying foundational of the

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,820
technology but the difference between

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,280
successful projects and failed projects

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,560
really comes down to the approach on

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,780
these other additional three things on

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,140
what it means to have better processes

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,020
to build a culture that embraces these

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:11,650
kinds of changes and to be able to have

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,090
real value in and around the data let me

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,100
go into that in just a little bit more

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,800
detail and this will also be part of the

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,660
more detailed discussion that we have in

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,490
one of the sessions that we have a

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,030
little bit later today but when you

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,890
think about process AI itself is not a

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,780
thing many of us think if I go implement

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,770
AI everything is gonna be great

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,750
AI actually is an ingredient into

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,690
something that is a better process a

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,270
better application a better workflow and

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,340
so when you put AI components into

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,790
production mission-critical types of

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,520
workloads what becomes essential is that

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,420
you really understand how you take that

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,340
living ever changing ever improving AI

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:57,550
component and how you have visibility

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:00,190
into how a I came to a decision in terms

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,800
of explained ability of that model trust

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,470
of that model transparency of that model

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,780
and the continuous operational change or

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,360
AI ops that is necessary to keep that

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,400
going that's the first component when we

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,480
really think about process what do you

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,670
think about culture it really is about

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,100
driving a culture of continuous learning

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,750
in your organization's one of the things

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,510
that we often talk about is the average

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,030
skills for technology today is anywhere

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:31,000
between two and three years 24 to 36

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,330
months in AI that skills gap is actually

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,760
a lot smaller it's 18 to 24 months and

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,190
when you think about like what it means

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,180
to have a culture that is ready for AI

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:45,270
it isn't just about creating a group

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,289
of data scientists AI is going to impact

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:51,389
every job that is out there and when you

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,310
really talk about changing the processes

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,979
as we talked about that means that you

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,889
have to have a culture that really

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:02,610
enables every person to understand how

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,800
AI is going to impact their job and what

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,190
it means to have not only a tops down

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,389
but a bottom up culture that embraces

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,370
this kind of change because when you're

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,009
talking about processes that you change

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,860
all across your organization across

00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,949
every application every kind of workflow

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,759
it means that you have to have an agile

00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:26,310
culture that embraces learning now

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,139
finally data this is probably one of the

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,349
most important ones because to be able

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,410
to have good artificial intelligence you

00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:36,840
need good data so what does that mean

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,990
when most organizations don't even

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,910
understand where their data is much less

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,099
the data that is actually necessary to

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,550
drive the kinds of AI that is important

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,889
to them so when you think about those

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,560
three things about process culture and

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:55,139
data and the value that you get from

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,870
that data if you take the last one their

00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,880
journey to AI really looks like you can

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,669
apply AI in any one of these different

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,099
areas most organizations are in the

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,990
middle over here and if you take a look

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,849
at it the left hand side are mostly

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,550
workloads that you see they're driven by

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,949
IT organizations usually siloed in

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,870
nature the right hand side in terms of

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,270
having self-service analytics or having

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,610
new business models it's about taking

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:23,370
data and artificial intelligence and

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,750
bringing it to more consumers whether

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,810
that be different parts of your business

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,639
your end clients and therefore the way

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,199
you think about data and the way you

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,500
think about the processes and the

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,510
applications you have are different than

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,370
what you do on the left hand side and

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:44,459
this jump from the left to the right is

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:46,709
a struggle for most organizations not

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,660
because of the technology because of the

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,339
three things that we mentioned you have

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,320
to disrupt the processes that you have

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,510
in your organization you have to disrupt

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,329
that culture and you have to treat data

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,480
too

00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:02,769
friendly so when we think about it you

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,069
can say there is no AI without IA you

00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:08,889
know 80% of data is either untrusted or

00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:10,139
inaccessible or unanalyzed and when it

00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,399
comes down to it

00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:16,059
organizations don't even know where to

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,040
be able to start with that I'll leave

00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:20,649
you with three questions to think about

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,499
the first is when you think about how

00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:25,269
you're applying AI in your business how

00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:28,600
does that align to the top priorities in

00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:31,239
your org how are you building not just

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,699
an AI culture but a date of first

00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:35,889
culture and what are you doing to

00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,899
upskill every part of your organization

00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:41,319
not just the data scientists in your org

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:42,999
this is absolutely critical now if you

00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:45,279
want to understand where to get started

00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,619
and how to really take a lot of the

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,910

00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:53,980
