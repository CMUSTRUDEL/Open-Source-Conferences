Publication date: 2019-10-16
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2019 - London, UK
Description: 
	Across industries, AI is viewed as the key to transforming organizations and fundamentally changing the way people work. However, adoption of AI has been slow, and there is a misconception that if you aren’t immediately successful, then your AI strategy doesn’t work. However, the truth is, in order for AI to thrive within an organization, it first needs to fail. Failure allows organizations to rethink and rework how they approach data, processes, and culture.
Ritika Gunnar explores why you need to focus on your organization’s culture and build a data-first approach to shape a strong, AI-ready organization.
This keynote is sponsored by IBM Watson.
