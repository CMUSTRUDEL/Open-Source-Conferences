Description: 
	It’s hard these days to ignore the attention given to autonomy and robotics. The impact is significant and the reach across the industry is extensive, hitting transportation with self-driving cars, logistics and supply chain with mobile robots, and remote sensing applications with aerial vehicles or drones.
Raffaello D’Andrea presents his vision of how autonomous indoor drones will drive the next wave of autonomous robotics development and growth, highlighting how new applications for this platform are brought to market. From carrying LEDs or costumes as part of a spectacular stage effect to carrying sensors to enable IoT applications in industrial facilities, the applications for carrying lightweight and high-value payloads are numerous. Join Raffaello to see how the underlying core technologies for autonomy and indoor drones can take you from touring with Metallica to scanning barcodes in warehouses.
