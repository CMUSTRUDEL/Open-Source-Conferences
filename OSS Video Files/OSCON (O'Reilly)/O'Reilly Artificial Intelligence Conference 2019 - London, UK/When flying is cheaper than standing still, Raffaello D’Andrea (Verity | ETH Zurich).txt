Title: When flying is cheaper than standing still, Raffaello D’Andrea (Verity | ETH Zurich)
Publication date: 2019-10-17
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2019 - London, UK
Description: 
	It’s hard these days to ignore the attention given to autonomy and robotics. The impact is significant and the reach across the industry is extensive, hitting transportation with self-driving cars, logistics and supply chain with mobile robots, and remote sensing applications with aerial vehicles or drones.
Raffaello D’Andrea presents his vision of how autonomous indoor drones will drive the next wave of autonomous robotics development and growth, highlighting how new applications for this platform are brought to market. From carrying LEDs or costumes as part of a spectacular stage effect to carrying sensors to enable IoT applications in industrial facilities, the applications for carrying lightweight and high-value payloads are numerous. Join Raffaello to see how the underlying core technologies for autonomy and indoor drones can take you from touring with Metallica to scanning barcodes in warehouses.

here is a use case of having an

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,360
autonomous system drone system this is

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,450
very similar to Kiva in spirit and style

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,369
you have autonomous drones that dock do

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,020
autonomous takeoff autonomous landing

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,340
and in this case what they're doing is

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,680
they're flying around the facility and

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,599
making sure that things are where

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,399
they're supposed to be reading barcodes

00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,960
making sure that there are no empty

00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,880
slots or the empty slots are where

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,169
they're supposed to be you can use them

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,080
for inspection you can use them for

00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:35,580
security and the idea is to be fully

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,980
autonomous there's no one flying these

00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,870
things right one of the things that

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,260
often comes up when when I talk to

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,490
people about such a system is is you

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,740
know they always ask well what's the

00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,840
battery life well it doesn't matter it's

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,760
a system for us battery life is a system

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,550
parameter if you put too little of

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,380
battery life it's not a good thing to do

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,660
because you're you're spending most of

00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,550
your time flying to your mission and not

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,260
actually performing it if you put too

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,300
big of a battery on it that's also not

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,070
good because you're basically just

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,420
carrying your battery your payload as

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,840
your battery your vehicle has to be

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,640
large you can actually optimize battery

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,710
life to give you the best operating

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,990
costs for your system because it's a

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,080
system it's not a drone it's a complete

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,760
system that you are creating so what are

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,350
the benefits of doing something with

00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,540
autonomous drones relative to current

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,310
practices collecting data well one is

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,159
very efficient you know you can free up

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,560
people to do high-value things that an

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,869
automated system can do instead there's

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,190
the obvious safety factor right there's

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,690
a lot of things that human do at Heights

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,240
collecting data well you can have a

00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,860
drone do that instead the autonomy

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,979
aspect is huge because you can set it up

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,080
as background tasks you can collect data

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:48,119
on a regular basis and that gives you

00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,700
the insights right how to better improve

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,439
your processes not only can you collect

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,900
data in better ways than it's done now

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,360
but you can do it more frequently with

00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,210
less errors to streamline your

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,380
operations relative to fix sensors what

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,020
are the benefits well you can do it

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,610
dynamically if you have a fixed sensor

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,530
if you if you really need to have

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,569
something that's fixed right collecting

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,239
data all the time then you know you

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,200
wouldn't want to do it dynamically

00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,000
conversely if you only need to collect

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,500
data once a year then you

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,910
don't really need a system like this but

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
there's a lot of things in between where

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,960
you need to collect data on an hourly

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,270
basis a weekly basis even a monthly

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,670
basis and you do it dynamically you put

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,860
the sensors where you need them when you

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,560
need them you can also make the system

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,450
future-proof you don't have to install a

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,570
large facility million square-foot

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,670
facility with a whole bunch of type of

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,670
sensing technology which then perhaps

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,650
becomes obsolete after a couple of years

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,350
instead you're you're changing your

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,530
sensing modalities on the vehicle itself

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:54,060
and as a result it can be extremely cost

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,459
effective here's a typical use case or

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,950
an initial use case let's call it that

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,720
is barcode scanning being able to read

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,610
inventory in a warehouse the back end of

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,650
a warehouse to make sure that pallets

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,989
are where they're supposed to be if you

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,390
look at the cost savings relative to the

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,860
way that it's done right now for low for

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,750
things that just have low levels maybe

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,390
only 10 feet high it's about three to

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,340
five times more cost-effective but as

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,100
soon as you get into facilities and

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,900
warehouses that are 30 feet and above

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,450
you know the you have orders of

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,549
magnitude efficiency gains to be had and

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,560
that doesn't even include the safety

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,980
advantage that you have from such a

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,980
system

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,250
