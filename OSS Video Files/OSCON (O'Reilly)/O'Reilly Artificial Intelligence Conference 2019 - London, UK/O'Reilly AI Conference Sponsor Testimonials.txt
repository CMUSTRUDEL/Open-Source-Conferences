[Music]

00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:14,860
I came to learn about it

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,680
hey I use the future right so everything

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,480
is attractive and every booth that you

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,830
go to there's something to learn

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,750
usually you spend an hour talking about

00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,800
like what is AI what is not and I

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,840
haven't got that question once it's more

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,060
it's gonna details what is now it's mine

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,470
what are you doing with bot services and

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,180
chat box and what are you doing with

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,290
machine learning and what you know what

00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,120
are you offering what are other

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,829
customers doing we're having much deeper

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,500
conversations with customers for example

00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,660
how do I combine natural language with

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,910
text analytics with computer vision to

00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,620
solve a problem and to me that's a

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,879
really helpful sign because it shows

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,160
that the understanding of this

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,850
technology is growing one of the best

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,989
things about this conference is you get

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,089
one-to-one access with so many

00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:57,219
practitioners people who are in the

00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:00,760
weeds for doing the actual ground work

00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:02,320
it's so refreshing to hear that they can

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,120
read their challenges are what are the

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:12,250
emerging trends

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:13,990
I can get a more general sense since

00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,030
about like what people are coming for

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,220
and I feel like everyone seems pretty

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,080
enthused about what they're getting away

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,300
from the conference the keynote sessions

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,800
was made and there's been audiences

00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,510
you're right through the day I mean I've

00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,010
been standing talking to a lot of people

00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,310
I've met people from many different

00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,530
industries ranging from government to

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,690
pharmaceutical and finance and they all

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:41,860
they all have different types of data

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:43,480
but they all have the same so

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,180
overwhelming so much you're learning so

00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,040
exciting I guess see this one I'm pure

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,160
the next conference the next next

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,440
