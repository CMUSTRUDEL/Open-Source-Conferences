	00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,620
so I'm Brian Granger one of the

00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:08,620
cofounders and student council members

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:12,110
of project Jupiter I've been involved

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,690
since the very early days of when it was

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,490
just ipython some highlights of my

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:21,380
research design and development work I

00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,990
have done a range of different projects

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,800
in the Python data science scientific

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:31,609
computing ecosystem PI 0 mq was one of

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,920
the early things we did around ipython

00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:38,480
and Jupiter to create the what has

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,190
become the Jupiter message protocol I am

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,520
the physicist by training so I've worked

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,950
some and sympa on symbolic quantum

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,540
mechanics library and then a lot of work

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,310
and ipython and Jupiter and the more

00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,930
recently with Jake van der plas the

00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:56,720
Altair statistical visualization library

00:00:52,930 --> 00:01:00,140
direction my current work doing spending

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,810
a lot of time on Jupiter lab and then

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,239
thinking about and talking to a lot of

00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,510
people about the main topic of this talk

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,760
namely enterprise usage of Jupiter large

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,130
complex organizations and the various

00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,690
needs they have one of the the big

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,690
emerging needs in particular is

00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,760
sensitive and confidential data

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:23,000
governance and organizational aspects of

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,830
Jupiter as the project is growing these

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,090
questions are becoming really important

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:32,360
and so spending a lot of time on that

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,659
Jupiter's diverse and that's a statement

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,790
of fact today but also an aspirational

00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,909
thing that we want Jupiter to become a

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,190
more diverse and welcoming project both

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,750
for our core contributors as well as our

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,810
users I

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,570
one way that we monitor the diversity of

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,370
our users one among many is to just look

00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,659
at the traffic on Google Analytics and

00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:58,909
when I checked recently the continent

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,820
that's most represented in website

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,979
visitors to Jupiter org is now Asia it's

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,000
not North America it's not Europe so we

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,019
have a very diverse community of users

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,900
and then also thinking a lot about

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:14,840
financial and community sustainability a

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,569
lot of that is fundraising

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,480
but I would say in many respects it's

00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:22,400
not just fundraising it's a lot around

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,450
sort of the long-term picture and

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,239
sustainable responsible fundraising and

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,879
then I'm the one that is more or less

00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,239
leading Jupiter's Enterprise partnership

00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,430
strategy right now a bit of an outline I

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,190
want to begin by talking about the

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,379
rewards and risks of adopting

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,830
open-source software in large

00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:48,019
organizations second talk about the

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,420
characteristics of effective enterprise

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,040
engagement with open source so if you're

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,900
an organization you decided yeah that's

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,630
something we want to do what are best

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,340
practices and in particular want to

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,650
introduce a few mental models that are I

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,220
think helpful in thinking about this

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,900
type of engagement best practices and

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,519
then a bit about how Jupiter as a

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,280
project is evolving to address these

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,560
enterprise usage cases so something

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,879
we're calling Jupiter whitepapers a new

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,310
initiative on sensitive and confidential

00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:19,010
data and then enterprise deployments of

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,350
Jupiter not really in this talk is

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,480
basically everything else that you can

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,970
find here at Jupiter Khan I'm not going

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,569
to do a deep dive into what Jupiter is

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,639
what the notebook is or Jupiter lab or

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,810
the amazing ways that a lot of people

00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,730
are using Jupiter so just a very short

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,340
overview to set the stage for this talk

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,319
so a project Jupiter exists to develop

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,880
open source software open standards and

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,060
services for interactive and

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,849
reproducible computing and the main

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,810
point I want to make in terms of setting

00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:56,209
the background is what we're seeing is a

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,380
phase transition right now between the

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,639
historical sort of usage patterns of

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,799
individuals with or gonna within

00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:08,989
organizations using Jupiter in an ad hoc

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:12,470
manner to the new world of large scale

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:15,950
officially adopted Jupiter deployments

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,570
within these organizations and this is

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,320
happening very quickly a lot of

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,169
organizations are doing this many

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,500
different types of organizations we've a

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,610
lot of us here even a Jupiter con are

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,130
seeing

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,680
about the various data science platforms

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,320
that cloud providers have as well as a

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,890
number of other startups Jupiter's being

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,640
used in data journalism in academic and

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,800
scientific publishing the full range of

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,170
educational contexts ranging from K to

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,650
12 education university education as

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:54,020
well as online education internal data

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,930
science machine learning and AI teams

00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,230
within industry and then large-scale

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,420
scientific collaborations and so this is

00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,670
this is an emerging new pattern that

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,880
we're seeing happen very quickly in the

00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,280
Jupiter ecosystem so I want to talk

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,330
about three rewards and three risks of

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,100
open source adoption first the rewards

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,940
open source software enables disruptive

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,730
innovation when you look at the many

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,380
major sort of software driven tech

00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,860
revolutions that have happened over the

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,090
last few decades you'll typically find

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,550
open source software and open source

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,150
standards played a critical role some

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:42,290
examples the internet net netscape

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:43,880
apache HTTP HTTP server HTML HTTP cloud

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,510
computing so this emerged in the

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:50,630
mid-2000s first with Amazon Web Services

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:54,050
and really Linux was the thing that made

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:57,620
that all possible and one thing that

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,870
you'll notice in the dates here the open

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,770
source projects typically were started

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,680
long before the corresponding revolution

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,810
that they enabled data science machine

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,780
learning ai this has sort of been going

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:15,770
on for the last decade here are some

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:18,500
dates of Python are ggplot2 numpy again

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,900
these projects predate the sort of broad

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
public awareness of data science and

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,830
machine learning by a longtime

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,390
containerization docker kubernetes

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,700
everyone right now is thinking about how

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:35,060
do we deploy at scale using these

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,490
approaches and again in almost all these

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,530
cases there's a time lag open-source

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,910
work begins and then some amount of

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,250
years later

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:47,270
that open-source work leads to major

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,190
changes and how we all work an example

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,630
for my own project with Jupiter and

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:56,420
ipython we began working on the ipython

00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,220
notebook back in 2005 and by the time

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,040
the ipython notebook was released in

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,260
2011 we had already thrown out multiple

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,940
prototypes right so this this is

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,570
something that we could begun working on

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,880
long long ago long before sort of data

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,470
science and machine learning really

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,160
became something that everyone was

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,390
talking about so what does this mean

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,400
organizations that adopt and engage with

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,220
open source have a head start and

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,040
innovation adopting open source software

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,230
is like having an R&D lab with a three

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,600
to five year horizon it's a way of

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,880
looking into the future about what is

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,040
coming next

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,920
next open source software enables your

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,110
business organization to focus on its

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,780
core business hopefully your

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,630
organization does have a core product

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,490
service or mission everything outside of

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,430
that has the potential to be an

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,680
expensive distraction for example if

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,210
you're a financial services company you

00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:25,310
don't want to have to build a data

00:07:53,210 --> 00:08:27,070
science platform the third award is open

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,410
source adoption puts you in control

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:33,760
typically open source projects have a

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:36,140
rich ecosystem flexible use and reuse

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,500
built out around open source software

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,870
projects open source software is like

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,940
the latest set it's easy to build a set

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,490
that comes with the box with the

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,800
instructions but the building blocks can

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,649
be reassembled

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,929
anything you need with this label

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,360
mindset is faster than expensive to

00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:59,529
build you know throw things out combined

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,860
we use extend if you purchase software

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,839
from a vendor proprietary software

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,019
you're really a diversity if they don't

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:12,309
offer the exact thing that you need can

00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:14,470
be extremely painful so one of the risks

00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:16,809
of open-source adoption so the first

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,049
risk is actually the same as the first

00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:22,540
war namely open-source software enables

00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:25,509
disruptive innovation why am I saying

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,339
this risk so leveraging open-source

00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:30,610
software and your organization a head

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:32,259
start to innovation however many

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,959
companies have woken up to find that

00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:37,119
their core product or service is now

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,249
competing with the freely available open

00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:42,489
source software project everyone in the

00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:44,920
world is adopting so it's important to

00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:47,589
recognize that this aspect of open

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:52,089
source cuts both ways and you want to be

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:54,790
on the right side of an important

00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,100
observation that we have for many years

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,339
of working in this area in these

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,889
situation situations open source all

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:04,569
these words so for each of these arrests

00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,269
we're talking about communications

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:09,910
the first mitigation here is don't fight

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:13,569
it if your organization finds itself

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:18,220
with this course embrace that and use it

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:19,990
as an opportunity second you want to

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,089
make sure you have a number of these

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,399
signal on these things so you have time

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:27,129
to adjust you don't want to find out

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,309
long after all of your competitors are

00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:31,329
you realize this can last it's

00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,999
particularly important in these

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:44,199
situations to engage with open source

00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:47,619
projects next as a risk open source open

00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:49,370
source is like an R&D lab with a three

00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:51,950
to five year

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,800
Rison another data plate the Jupiter

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,570
ecosystem Jupiter lab is the next

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,420
generation user interface that we are

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:03,980
building or doing that will replace the

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:07,490
classic notebook and Jupiter lab went

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,550
into beta release in January recently

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,180
left the beta tag behind and so it is

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,180
ready for production

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,430
community consensus and decisions take

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:33,230
time if you have to go to market

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:35,480
six months ago open slowly some

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,890
observations we have working with a lot

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,580
of companies that are adopting open

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:43,190
source it's possible in the short term

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,930
or company or organization to hire a

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,230
bunch of people and start to build

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,850
something from scratch and much more

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,910
quickly than an open source project

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,810
however in the long term open source

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,890
will dramatically help those small teams

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:02,320
and so I think it's important to

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:05,180
recognize timeframes involved mitigation

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,490
if your organization needs to be very

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,230
quickly it's useful to have parallel

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,060
short term and long term strategies

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,940
where the goal of the short term

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,890
strategy but to enable you to get to

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,290
market quickly get in front of customers

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:22,520
and to enable you to transition to a

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:25,580
longer term strategy and then again it's

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,300
helpful to engage with your critical

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,860
path open source projects effective ways

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,140
third race lack of enterprise support

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,820
the communities who fill open source

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,800
software typically do not offer it to

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:46,190
true price support who do you call when

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:47,850
something goes wrong some large open

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,890
source projects because

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:54,500
the vendors that film that doubt but

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:57,780
certainly that is projects so

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,700
mitigations i think the most important

00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,190
one is to hire train and support

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,660
internal experts on critical resource

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:08,070
technologies second engagement critical

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,680
of insurance projects in effective ways

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,440
you'll notice that this last point here

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,300
is a communication point than all the

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,240
risks that I've talked about so what I

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,400
want to talk about now is what I mean by

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,610
effective engagement with all these

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,400
projects and here's where I wanted to

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:30,510
introduce two mental models first mental

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:34,610
model is puppets open-source software

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:37,590
project like a big yard for puppies

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,280
puppies are amazing everyone loves

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,920
puppets

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,020
lots of people stop by to play with the

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,660
puppies to take them for walks throw

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:49,050
them all for them these are like the

00:13:45,660 --> 00:14:00,510
users of the open-source projects a few

00:13:49,050 --> 00:14:03,150
people the maintainers just to keep the

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:07,980
existing puppies happy healthy requires

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:16,340
an a ton of work working in a yard full

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:16,340
of puppies imagine four yard

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,970
contributions to an open-source project

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:32,370
and I want to credit brett cannon who's

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:35,160
at Microsoft this mental model his tweet

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,960
that brought up was pull request can be

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,600
like someone can give you a puppy you

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,030
didn't ask for they mean well but you

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,540
can get but they can forget a puppy is a

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,540
decade

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:51,180
useful mental model of thinking about

00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,920
how the food source projects larger the

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,560
sight of mental model is that a central

00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:00,810
partner so you know confronting it

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,329
brings priceless value to the residents

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,250
of visitors to New York City magically

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:09,029
improving the quality of life for the

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,070
parks 42 million visitors a year it took

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,640
incredibly forward-thinking of long term

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:17,880
investment so most of the current 843

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,390
heaters of Central Park or set aside all

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,459
the way back in 1953 it's currently

00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,800
managed by a nonprofit organization of

00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,339
Central Park Conservancy that is a

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:35,459
relatively new way that the park has

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:47,100
been managed to begin in the current

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:47,850
maintenance cost today it again is

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,070
priceless

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,980
one in terms of the value that provides

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,180
to New York City but second just the

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,230
valuation of the land

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,300
it looked up some stats and land brought

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,660
land value in central Manhattan is

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,519
around a hundred million an acre and so

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,110
the just land of Central Park that's

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,880
around 80 billion dollars and today to

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,610
maintain the park there's thousands of

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:20,250
volunteers that work alongside hundreds

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:23,579
of it important part that I want to

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:27,990
emphasize here is that any attempt by a

00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:30,360
company or another entity to try to mine

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,640
this value of Central Park for

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,130
themselves and an exclusive manner would

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,220
quickly destroyed the park if you could

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,470
imagine a company saying hey we really

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,880
like the duck pond over there we want to

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,880
put those feds in charge of mission

00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,759
so with these mental models of mine what

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,759
are some best best practices first we

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,589
want to talk about maintain errs this is

00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,049
us I mean this word in a very generic

00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:01,119
way in some projects there's a very

00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:03,879
precise meaning about whether maintainer

00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:07,019
is the maintainer of an open-source

00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:09,699
project they're the people who maintain

00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,179
and are ultimately responsible for the

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,579
project

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:16,740
they don't necessarily do all the work

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,740
but they are ultimately responsible for

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,779
responsibilities decision-making these

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,750
often differ by the project's governance

00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:28,179
models organization some of the

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:36,899
activities of maintainer governance and

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:36,899
organizational issues

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,950
[Music]

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,840
it's also important to note that

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,470
open-source maintainer are sometimes

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,830
paid it but are often volunteers in the

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:35,679
Jupiter ecosystem the different parts of

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:39,970
two-thirds typically have a small number

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:43,960
of paving dinners we're small sometimes

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,529
as a small as one person part time other

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,529
parts of the project have multiple

00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,529
painters

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,100
a number of people work on this project

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,380
more or less full-time and then there's

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,880
dozens to hundreds of volunteers around

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:06,130
those containers whatever reality check

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,500
so what I talked about open source being

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,350
like yard puppies there's thousands of

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,870
puppies preparing the top I just like to

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:19,360
be screenshots dear the thing I want to

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,450
look at is the number of both issues and

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,590
pull requests so if your maintainer a

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,230
scikit-learn

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,450
there are currently six hundred and

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,350
eighteen new puppies that people want to

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:35,550
use for each of those you've got to go

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:40,030
and do the code review have discussions

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:52,150
618 all of these have on the order of a

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:54,430
thousand open issues just to exist on

00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:58,390
the maintainer zuv open source projects

00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:01,300
is massive it's astounding so what are

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,040
some best practices recognize that the

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,570
writing of new code is not the

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,360
bottleneck in open source software

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,790
projects all of us who are maintaining

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,250
open source projects we love to write

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,380
new code and the the reason that we're

00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,240
not doing it more is the rest of the

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,050
bigger picture that is also critically

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,060
important so I think the the best rule

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:25,750
of healthy engagement of open source

00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,840
projects in some particular companies

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,370
wanting to engage is begin by actively

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,040
supporting the maintainer zuv open

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:36,130
source projects take time to understand

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,710
the real needs of the projects if you

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,170
wanna your employees to actively engage

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,760
and start working on the project I'm

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,310
recommending a three phase approach

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,210
phase one is to have those employees

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:52,840
start by helping with issues of

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:56,380
commenting on helping to do triage on

00:20:52,840 --> 00:21:00,400
issues and reviewing pull requests this

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:03,400
is a fantastic way to build trust and to

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,960
get familiar with a project phase two

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,510
would be everything in phase one plus

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,350
starting to fix bugs and then phase 3

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:15,020
was everything in phase 2 and 1 plus new

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,020
features and the key thing here is

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,250
balance so even when you if you have

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,860
employees that want that are

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:25,220
contributing to an open-source project

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:27,440
they get trust once they get trust they

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,419
shouldn't just then switch to doing new

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,570
features and abandon all the other work

00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:35,120
they need to continue to participate in

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:38,690
in the other activities that take a ton

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,940
of time for the entire project we're

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,029
working in project Jupiter right now to

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,970
figure out how to encode these ideas one

00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:48,830
of the challenges is that not everyone

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,270
who comes to try to contribute to an

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,669
open-source project is at the same level

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:55,520
and we want the project's to continue to

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,710
be very open and welcoming to people who

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,960
are contributing for the first time at

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:03,980
the same time trying to balance these

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,659
questions so this trust this approach

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,730
will build trust and the maintainer z'

00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:11,000
will go out of their way to help you and

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,350
new features will accelerate the the

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,549
thing that's frightening

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:19,279
to me and exciting about open-source so

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,980
I work a lot on Jupiter lab and we'll

00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:25,520
get a backlog of pull requests requiring

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,190
review and what happens when any of us

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,610
allocate time to reviewing pull requests

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:34,909
is not only do those pull requests get

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:37,340
merged it acts as a signal to everyone

00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:39,710
else in the project that the that we are

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,929
open for business for new pull requests

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,850
to get submitted and it's a bit

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,950
discouraging because we'll spend all day

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,250
long reviewing 30 pull requests will

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:51,679
merge 30 by the end of the next day

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:54,470
there'll be 30 more and this is the type

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,360
of acceleration that happens when open

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,970
source projects pay attention to the

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,500
fact that it's not the writing of new

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,870
code that's the bottleneck right it's

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,899
all the other stuff around it and when

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,460
that other stuff is tended to

00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:09,710
acceleration happens on those new

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,750
features that everyone is interested so

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,840
a key things to avoid I'm going to be

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,789
brutally honest here don't hire an

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,530
open-source maintainer and give them

00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,740
less

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:23,020
to work on an open-source project if you

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,570
want to hire someone who's a maintainer

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,490
of an open-source project when you're

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,340
interviewing ask them how many hours a

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,870
week are you spending on open-source

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,630
don't be surprised if they give you a

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,690
number that's greater than 40 right and

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:40,900
if you want to hire them please give

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,490
them more time right they already have

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,580
too little time to do what they're doing

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:48,730
and if you hire them and give them less

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,320
time you are actively damaging the open

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,600
source project that you're seeking to

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,660
support I can't emphasize this enough

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,720
we've seen this played out hundreds of

00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,730
times in various open source projects

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,610
where contributors and maintainer x' are

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,390
hired by a company and their time dies

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:09,310
off and the open source project suffers

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,560
dramatically this is something we need

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:14,740
to talk about openly and be brutally

00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,560
honest about and I would say I would

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,000
encourage companies to put this in your

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,490
employment contracts so when you're

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,950
hiring open-source maintainer x' put in

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,470
the contract how much of their time can

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,800
they devote to open source software

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,330
another thing is don't mess with numbers

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,970
for example if you tell them you can

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,070
work 20% on open-source that's one day a

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:41,350
week that day that week should not be

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:43,210
Saturday second don't hire a bunch of

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,190
people at your company to implement a

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,500
lot of new features to an open source

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,780
project without supporting the existing

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,090
maintainer x' right going back to the

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,890
puppy analogy this is like saying hey

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:59,050
let's get a massive truck buy a bunch of

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,970
puppies and go deliver them to the puppy

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,310
yard because everyone knows that puppies

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,690
are great right first you need to tend

00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:09,160
to the puppies that are there already

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,230
better yet make sure the existing

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,950
puppies and their maintainer are happy

00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,990
and healthy first so how is Jupiter

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,840
evolving to address these enterprise

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,640
usage cases first we started a new

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,340
initiative called Jupiter white papers

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,220
these are an emerging effort to encode

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,800
and create our strategic initiatives and

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,970
roadmaps that large enterprises are

00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,950
interested in

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,080
the jupiter white paper describes the

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:38,130
specific and substantial areas of work

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:42,130
we are proposing in non-technical terms

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:44,500
the audience for white papers is not a

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:48,190
technical audience these are funding

00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:50,550
funders and business decision-makers who

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,380
are interested engaging with the project

00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:58,330
I'm gonna skip through this fairly

00:25:53,380 --> 00:26:00,730
quickly the the foundation of Jupiter is

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,130
its open community of users contributors

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,990
and maintained errs and ultimately this

00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,510
community determines a direction of the

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,990
project and is responsible for its

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,910
growth and health at the same time the

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,740
sustainability and growth of the project

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:18,520
requires the involvement of

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:23,080
organizational and funding partners to

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:25,450
put it more plainly Jupiter is a massive

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,270
effort and requires millions of dollars

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,400
a year of funding just to keep doing

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,810
what we're already doing right if we

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,400
want to even go beyond that and build

00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:38,080
new things additional funding is needed

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,000
so white papers are designed to be a

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,340
focal point for communication between

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,440
the community and organizational and

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,930
funding partners their way for the

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,380
project to say here's what we'd like to

00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,850
build would you like to partner with us

00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,160
so this is a way for us to find the

00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,720
intersection between this these two

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,210
questions of what is the project

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,830
interested in building and what are

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:03,330
different enterprise partners and

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:08,050
funding organizations willing to fund

00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:11,580
I'm gonna skip this we started way late

00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:15,700
so I'm gonna compress here dramatically

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,590
we also have a new initiative sturdy

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,590
strategic initiative and there's a

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:22,120
number of white papers related to this

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:24,750
around sensitive and confidential data

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,700
and the short of this is that as

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:30,100
organizations adopt Jupiter at scale in

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,700
an official capacity they're realizing

00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:35,830
that much of their data is sensitive or

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,490
confidential in some manner whether it's

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:42,400
governed by legal compliance frameworks

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,740
such as gdpr HIPAA ferpa or it's just

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,840
proprietary company data

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,550
in these types of Jupiter deployments

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,590
this is becoming the norm rather than

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,240
the exception which is interesting

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,750
because Jupiter has grown up in a

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,340
context of open data in the open science

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:03,280
context this is something that we're

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:06,550
really pushing hard on so again we're

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,340
I'm compressing massively I will post my

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,320
slides online so we have a couple new

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,080
grants related this and a lot of new

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,480
work going into Jupiter hub to address

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,240
large-scale organizational deployments

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,670
in a particular sensitive and

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,770
confidential data with that and then the

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,650
other big growth area for us is

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,570
Enterprise Jupiter deployments as we saw

00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,490
at the beginning organizations are

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,690
starting to deploy Jupiter with many

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:36,550
hundreds to many thousands of users and

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:39,730
Jupiter hub which is the part of Jupiter

00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,770
for these organizational deployments is

00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,410
really a set of building blocks that

00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,690
lets organizations create a deployment

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,790
based on their needs and different

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:52,120
organizations have very different needs

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,430
and constraints that include mapping

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,980
complex organizational structures onto

00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,750
compute and data business needs patterns

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,120
of collaborations different

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,310
organizational personas it's not all

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,880
data scientists who use Jupiter at these

00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:08,650
organizations furthermore Jupiter is

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,110
compute intensive and can be very

00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,990
expensive to deploy so it's not any

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,950
common to hear someone a user of Jupiter

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:21,850
say all I need is a p3 16x large

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:24,190
instance with eight GPUs and those I

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,710
think currently cost around 17 grand a

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,300
month so they are non-trivial from a

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,180
cost perspective which is a critical

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,550
thing so this is an emerging need for

00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,920
large organizations to have scalable

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,470
maintainable secure reliable

00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,260
cost-effective and highly customized

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,210
Jupiter deployments that integrate with

00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,490
the rest of their data strategy and

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,190
we're currently investigating ways of

00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,050
serving those users and you can look for

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,260
some announcements in the coming months

00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:55,660
so closing remarks this is an active

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,220
ongoing area of work

00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,950
be developing quickly in the coming

00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,900
months and if your your organization is

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,850
interested in talking with us further

00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,640
about any of these things the Jupiter

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:09,180
whitepapers Enterprise Jupiter

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,680
deployments or your broader open source

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,590
strategy please get in touch with me my

00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:17,560
email address is here and I should also

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:20,010
mention at this point we have a drafts

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,540
of around 20 different white papers

00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:24,820
describing strategic initiatives that

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,110
we're looking at pursuing related to

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,810
different parts of the projects so

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,480
there's a lot of ambitious plans we have

00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,900
and we'd love to talk to all of you

00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:41,689
about those things thank you

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:41,689
