Title: When Jupyter Becomes Pervasive at a University? Fernando Perez (UC Berkeley)
Publication date: 2018-08-24
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	In 2018, UC Berkeley launched a new major in data science, anchored by two core courses that are the fastest-growing in the history of the university. Fernando Pérez discusses the program and explains how the core courses, which now reach roughly 40% of the campus population, are extending data science into specific domains that cover virtually all disciplinary areas of the campus.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
I want to go back for a minute in 1999

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,179
when guido van rossum the creator of the

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,099
Python programming language submitted a

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,590
grant proposal titled computer

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,289
programming for everybody and in this

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,570
grant proposal he stated we compared the

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,210
math ability to read and write software

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,570
with mass literacy and predict equally

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,340
pervasive changes across society and I'd

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,320
like to think that Jupiter is a project

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,000
that not only uses Python and began as

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,189
ipython but that we actually are

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,350
continuing in the legacy of these ideas

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,920
but we are now moving them into a world

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,469
of data so imagine a world were using

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,899
Jupiter is as natural for anyone as

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,930
using email or the web we're data

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,809
analysis computation and principled

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,030
clean robust statistical inference are

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,910
pervasive not just pervasive among

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,559
scientists engineers and mathematicians

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,170
but across disciplines and this becomes

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,649
a common language for society to work on

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,320
our most challenging problems that world

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,850
is not the beautiful and inspiring

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,439
Jupiter that unfortunately has a

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,640
misspelling and uses an AI instead I'm

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,200
talking about this world a little bit

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,659
closer to home for those of you who

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
haven't been to our campus this is the

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,970
UC Berkeley maindou library and the

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,430
iconic Campanile in in california and

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,600
these two photographs were taken this

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,659
week so the top picture is the inaugural

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,890
lecture for a course called data eight

00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,259
foundations of data science and that's a

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,100
lecture with 1300 proximately 1,300

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,780
students if you've been to campus you

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,060
may notice you may have noticed that

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,909
that is not a regular classroom that is

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,060
Zellerbach Hall which is the theater

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,590
were the symphony plays and where operas

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,600
are performed because we don't have

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,079
lecture halls that can fit 1,300 people

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,600
anymore the photograph at the bottom was

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,520
taken last night and that's a lecture

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,219
that I was supposed to be delivering but

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm here playing hooky with you folks

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,229
and that is the opening class for a

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,989
course called data 100 which is an upper

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,930
division course in data science and that

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,070
has now close to 800 students and before

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,320
I go further

00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,480
I want to clarify that this is not only

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,040
happening at UC Berkeley okay this is

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
happening I know that things of this

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,910
kind are happening elsewhere many of you

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,550
are developing similar things and ideas

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,740
and I simply want to think of this

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,810
presentation as a case study of what

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,180
what I am seeing close to me but but I

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,350
recognize that similar developments are

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,840
happening elsewhere and you are

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,340
contributing to those so what is that

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,260
course what is this giant course

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,240
foundations of data science it's a

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,940
course that was developed to teach core

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,340
concepts and inference and computing by

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,250
working with real world data for

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,170
everyone it welcomes freshmen who come

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,480
into campus with no mathematical

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,180
prerequisites other than those needed

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,390
for admission to the University and its

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,160
focus is to try to teach the key

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,640
foundational ideas of introductory

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,590
statistics but by a very computationally

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,560
driven hands-on approach rather than

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,750
proving theorems and proving

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,910
mathematical ideas with probability

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,950
theory or calculus instead these are

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,870
built up in a constructive way with

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,340
computing and because they are

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,770
illustrated using real-world data

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,140
questions of ethical impact and human

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,470
context can be woven naturally into the

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:33,090
development that course is powered by

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,860
Jupiter you can all go right now well

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,140
hopefully a little bit later if you want

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,120
to pay attention for a minute you can go

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,190
to inferential thinking comm and read

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,810
the textbook for the class the textbook

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,180
is called computational and inferential

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,489
thinking it has been developed by

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,310
faculty both in statistics and computer

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,290
science jointly and as you read the book

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,540
and you page through the chapters you

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,780
will see little buttons at the top that

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,620
say interact those buttons allow anyone

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:05,130
to click on them and for a few seconds

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,560
you will get a little spinning logo from

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,090
from the binder homepage and then you

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,180
will be logged in without having to

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,830
install anything into a live version of

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,420
the textbook with notebooks available

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,090
for you to try so anyone in the world

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,290
can not only read but actually work on

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,740
this textbook

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,240
simply by clicking on these links for

00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:27,780
the faculty who are developing these

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,780
materials we've also developed

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,800
at Berkley tools to make it as easy as

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,870
possible to have textbooks that are

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,280
textbooks so that faculty can focus on

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,650
the development of their content and

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,900
simply write markdown files in Jupiter

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,760
notebooks and with one-click have that

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,250
material be available to others as a

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,050
textbook now with this kind of

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,300
infrastructure what we're seeing is

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,000
these become the fastest-growing courses

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,600
in Berkeley's history data eight now has

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,850
something around 1,300 students as I

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,890
mentioned with a long wait list and the

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,860
combined annual numbers for the course

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,920
if we include spring summer and fall

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,870
sessions are close to 3,000 students but

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,060
we're still have we still have large

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,340
wait lists the annual enrollment at

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,410
Berkeley is around 7500 students which

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,840
means once we can meet capacity once

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,370
we're not limited we have no no giant

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,290
wait lists and students who simply can't

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,720
take the course because we can't we

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,830
can't offer it to them it's it's very

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,510
reasonable to think that we'll be

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,300
reaching something like 50% of the

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,840
entire university every every every year

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,950
as those classes go through that that is

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,700
going to set some very interesting

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:41,790
changes now on campus students do not

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,650
have to use the binder the binder tool

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,320
which is kind of a way of demonstrating

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,180
the book has a demo they actually can

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,430
log in with their University ID and

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,410
anyone at Berkeley can go to data hub

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,360
that berkeley.edu and has a server

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,760
available to them via all of this was

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,320
created with the open tools that some

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,290
here and many of you in this community

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,570
have helped developed to give you a few

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,600
quick tech notes on how this works it

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,000
was we run it in the cloud but with a

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,360
with a with a very strong ethos of being

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,340
agnostic to vendors it has run in the

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,260
past on Rackspace it has runs on Google

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,750
infrastructure on Azure it has been run

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,640
on local clusters on campus and

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,860
obviously there is some complexity to

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,870
this deployment if you are an

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,460
organization where you want to do

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,140
something like this on a smaller scale I

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,660
encourage you to look at the littlest

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,450
jupiter hub or talk to you v panda one

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,030
of our core engineers who is here which

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,860
is a deployment that serves capacities

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,550
of say 10 between ten and a hundred

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,349
people

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,780
without all of the layers of complexity

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,490
that are needed for serving an entire

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,159
university and potentially tens of

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,889
thousands of cloud users an important

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,810
point is that all of the system allows

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,220
instructors to customize the actual

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,960
image that they're going to deploy and

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,449
the process is beautiful I as an

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,699
instructor can make changes to the user

00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,379
image that users will be logged in I

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,330
make a pull request to the repo I

00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,159
install the dependencies that I want a

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,680
few continuous integration checks are

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:12,900
made and if everything passes my changes

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,810
go live it's an absolutely spectacular

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,479
way to work I basically make pushes to

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,880
github I check Travis CI and it's live

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,470
for all my students this infrastructure

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,930
allows us to serve students at about

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,389
give or take two dollars per student per

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,520
week which is a very reasonable price

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,490
and an important point is that it opens

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,740
the door for access despite and trying

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,419
to lower economic barriers we do have

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,449
many students for whom we cannot assume

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,159
at UC Berkeley that they own a modern

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:42,599
top-end laptop and that's not an issue

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,370
because they can walk into the library

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,960
they can borrow from the library a

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,940
Chromebook just like they can check out

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,530
a book and we're using that Chromebook

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,150
they login and we provide all the

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,280
infrastructure so in terms of economic

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,669
barriers this is infrastructure that

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,409
really makes a difference I've talked

00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,819
about data eight and data 100 but there

00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,460
is actually a constellation of

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,960
additional educational materials built

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,360
around that that I'm going to speak for

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,529
a moment about first we have what are

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,490
called connector courses data eight is

00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,740
foundational ideas in data science

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,599
fairly generic and applicable to any doe

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,400
to many domains with data sets that

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,610
pretty much everyone can be familiar

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,199
with but on top of data eight these

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,330
connector courses have been developed

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,279
effectively to attach to it and go

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,020
deeper in various direction so someone

00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,969
may be interested more interested in in

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,380
more technical work in statistics and

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:33,180
probability theory someone may be

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,610
interested in algorithms someone may be

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,469
interested in sports analytics cancer

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,599
therapy

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,279
geography legal issues all of these

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,829
courses now take those foundational

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,899
ideas and use data it has a correct with

00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,550
it for students to to broaden their

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,670
knowledge in the areas that they now

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,320
potentially intend to major in and

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,209
there's a second layer of educational

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,820
resources that potentially has had even

00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,590
bigger in

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,230
Act which are called data science

00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,930
modules these are little fragments meant

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,090
to cover one or a few lectures to be

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,310
dropped into existing courses the

00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,920
connectors are new courses whereas the

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,930
modules are meant to enrich existing

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,850
courses so that faculty who may be

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,040
interested in bringing data science to

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,390
their domain but don't necessarily have

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,630
the skills and expertise to develop

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:22,210
entire new courses can say oh I will

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,670
partner with your team and you will help

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,290
me with this infrastructure and with the

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,510
content development on the technical

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,400
side while I provide the expertise of my

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,680
domain saying cognitive science or

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,330
American cultures and we will build

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,340
together a little module that I can then

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,900
drop in to my existing courses and this

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,910
also means that it doesn't require

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,710
modifying the entire curriculum that can

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,050
be put everywhere and so this is helping

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,930
these ideas spread towards the entire

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,260
campus throughout that in April of this

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,810
year

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,990
we had a new major approved in data

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,180
science and if we look at who is taking

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,880
these courses we see a huge part of

00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,350
majors every every every college and

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,360
every divisions and Letters and Sciences

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,360
is represented we have students from

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,310
about 73 majors and with a with a much

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,910
better gender distribution that is

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:12,880
typical in the stem courses on campus so

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,890
I think it is realistic to think that in

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,810
a few years as this wave goes through

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,390
Berkeley will indeed be a place where

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,540
these tools are as commonplace as using

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:24,660
Gmail and what we're seeing and these

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,130
are the words of Sarah Martinez a

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,110
biologist postdoc in bio in microbiology

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,390
molecular and cell biology at UC

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,610
Berkeley we are witnessing a monumental

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,830
face shift in data science knowledge on

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,070
campus our undergrads are extremely well

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:41,800
trained but this is creating a knowledge

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,810
gap were effectively the undergrads no

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,940
more than their faculty and their PI's

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,100
about this and those faculty are

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,070
incapable of knowing how to manage the

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,630
full potential of undergraduate help so

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:57,190
we're seeing this interesting sort of

00:10:52,630 --> 00:11:00,310
inversion of skills how is all of this

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,770
built we didn't have a 50 million dollar

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,020
donation to build this what we had were

00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,820
people specifically professor Katherine

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,150
Carson and historian of science and our

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,520
new dean of data science David

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,590
Koller led a team of mostly

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,540
undergraduate students with whom they

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,490
bootstrapped all of this along with

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,370
staff who have done a lot of the

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:22,640
engineering work and they've constructed

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,760
an organization with that has been able

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,750
to build this with really minimal

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,160
otherwise minimal resources and

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,350
infrastructure Catherine Carson has

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,410
engaged faculty from all across the

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,170
campus and being very very considerate

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,510
of bringing data science to the faculty

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,750
so that they can in their own terms

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:44,000
change how they basically dictate how

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,750
they absorb these ideas and change their

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,270
own teaching having always a mindset of

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,460
respect and inclusion especially with

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,620
the fact that computer science and tech

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,060
in many places but specifically at

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,560
Berkeley it's one of the largest majors

00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,690
on campus one of the richest departments

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,300
it may be perceived as a little bit

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,650
hegemonic or imperialistic by by other

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,630
disciplines and there's been a lot of

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,040
work being done to prevent that by

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,780
addressing it as a real issue that

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,820
rather than trying to hide it and by

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,650
using these students as ambassadors and

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,810
as Catherine says giving them the keys

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,360
to the kingdom and just letting them run

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,890
wild and build things having ethical

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,500
considerations woven into this

00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,270
construction from the start across all

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,740
of these disciplines and with all of

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,340
that she's they've been able to really

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,050
build in a very bootstrapped way with

00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,240
very few resources with a lot of

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,920
uncertainty a very high functioning

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,620
organization that has really that is

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,440
really transforming the university now

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,020
as I said it's not just at Berkeley we

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,450
recognize that this is data that Carol

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,640
willing already mentioned yesterday the

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,590
count of publicly available notebooks on

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,680
github has recently crossed two and a

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,360
half million notebooks and it shows no

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,740
sign that growth shows no sign of

00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,160
slowing down and it's not only us here

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:04,700
in in the u.s. actually our civilized

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,620
neighbors to the north are doing work at

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,750
an international scale where they are

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,760
actually deploying educational

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,910
infrastructure from caetera in the K

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,980
through 12 space all the way to research

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,990
infrastructure available to all Canadian

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,980
researchers in HPC and there's actually

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,990
a talk later today

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,950
of Canadians land on Jupiter where they

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,320
discuss some of this

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,990
work so we really are seeing a

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,240
transformation and I would like to know

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,390
to think about what this means for the

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,460
future where we headed if you teach how

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,160
will you teach when your undergraduate

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,380
students have this new baseline which

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,470
may be above yours in in certain

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,440
dimensions if you do research what kind

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,660
of research will you do when you can

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,070
hire even your undergrad interns come

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,830
with these skills or in your graduate

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,680
students therefore come with this what

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,020
products will you build in industry when

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,840
the workforce that is coming to you has

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,440
these skills on a massive scale

00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,570
and how do we train these students not

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,180
only in data skills but also in becoming

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:11,570
healthy contributors to open science and

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,970
open software development at this scale

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,100
which is a challenge so I don't have the

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,200
answers but I know that with this

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,450
community we will hopefully as Carol

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,830
said by 2023 have some wonderful ideas

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,560
and I'd like to thank you for your

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:27,020
attention

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,020
[Applause]
