Description: 
	In 2015, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration announced the first-ever detection of gravitational waves from the merger of a pair of stellar-mass black holes about 1.5 billion light-years away. This signal, dubbed GW150914, marked the beginning of the era of gravitational wave astronomy; the field has exploded in the three years since, with five more black hole mergers announced, the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to three founders of the LIGO project, and the first detection of a merger of neutron stars in August 2017.
