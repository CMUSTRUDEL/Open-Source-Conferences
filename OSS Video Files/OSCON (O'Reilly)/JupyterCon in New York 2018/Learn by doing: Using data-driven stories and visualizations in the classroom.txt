Title: Learn by doing: Using data-driven stories and visualizations in the classroom
Publication date: 2018-09-20

Description: 
	Learn by doing: Using data-driven stories and visualizations in the (high school and college) classroom
Carol Willing (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo), Jessica Forde (Jupyter), Erik Sundell (IT-Gymnasiet Uppsala)

Interactive content that combines a computational narrative, code, video, audio, and interactive widgets brings high school and college learning to life and puts students in charge of manipulating content and extending their learning. By giving students in the sciences and humanities alike engaging, cohesive content in familiar subjects using Jupyter notebooks, JupyterLab, and the rich Python, R, and Julia ecosystem, teachers can encourage students to develop data science literacy and use their increasing computational skill to build upon their interests.

Using examples from computational narratives, data-driven storytelling, citizen science, and animation, Carol Willing, Jessica Forde, and Erik Sundell demonstrate the value of interactive content and outline ways educators can help students develop data science literacy and use computational skills to build upon their interests. One difficulty for teachers is classroom access to modern computers and the ability to install software on those systems. Carol, Jessica, and Erik explain how teachers can deploy JupyterHub for a class using the “Zero to JupyterHub” guide, Kubernetes, and cloud services. Even if students only have access to smartphones, tablets, or shared computers, teachers can offer engaging content using Binder, which delivers a cloud-based notebook environment at the click of a button.

welcome everybody thank you for being

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,519
here hopefully everybody's having a

00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,349
great day so far and are learning Lots

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,680
and we'll take back the messages that

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:19,530
you learned to everybody else and I want

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,570
to introduce myself briefly I'm Carol

00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:26,070
Willing I love education I work on

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,450
Jupiter hi my name is jessica ford and i

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,929
also am a maintainer at project jupiter

00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:35,579
hi I'm Erik sandal I'm previously I was

00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,559
a teacher and now my work as a date

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,449
engineer but I still consider myself as

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,890
a teacher because my yeah I love it and

00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:47,399
I want to give Eric a special shout-out

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,829
because he is one of our community

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,729
contributors and has done an absolutely

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:58,109
phenomenal job on Jupiter hub and it

00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,149
goes to show like what you can get from

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,679
being dedicated to something and it's

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,010
been really a pleasure to work with him

00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,570
so thank you Eric okay so the overview

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,630
today we're going to talk a little bit

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,759
about the challenges of teaching

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,250
computational thinking then we're going

00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,649
to talk about teaching interactivity in

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,439
computer science using Jupiter notebooks

00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:21,810
we're going to talk also about teaching

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,360
students with Jupiter hub and then how

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,549
to do multi-language global instruction

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,619
using binder and then hopefully we'll

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,719
wrap up and have a good five minutes or

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,820
so for questions because I think that

00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:39,509
would be fun so take it away Jessica

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,920
okay so how many of you are educators of

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,280
one kind or another please raise your

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,079
hand okay so most of you are actually

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,289
probably know about these challenges

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,320
better than I do since I'm actually a

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:55,469
data scientist by training and I am more

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,109
aware of these challenges from working

00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,149
through the Jupiter community but I'm

00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,770
just gonna review some of these things

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,340
that you probably have already seen in

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,899
your classroom experience so typical

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,869
challenges you might experience in

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,819
education is how do you find interesting

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,830
content how do you make this content

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,540
relevant to your students how do we make

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,400
this content

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,659
cohesive how do we bring these these

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,739
things that you already found together

00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:25,420
in a way that tells a story and conveys

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:28,159
this content in a comprehensive way

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,489
oftentimes educators have minimal prep

00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,950
time for lessons and maybe you even have

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:38,560
a diverse group of students who have

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:42,859
different language skills or different

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:47,299
backgrounds or abilities so this is a

00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:50,510
photo of the data 8 course at UC

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,549
Berkeley and so this is what something

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,299
might look like if you're teaching a

00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:57,859
computational course and so adding

00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,930
computational resources to share content

00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:02,930
with these students adds additional

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,930
challenges to the mix and if any of you

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,970
remember your experiences dealing with

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,620
this I'm sure you can familiar with

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,169
these typical challenges but I think one

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,340
of the things I would like to highlight

00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,280
as something for us to think about

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,379
during this talk is just how do we deal

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,569
with getting these computational

00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,760
resources up and running because if many

00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:24,859
of you are familiar environment set up

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,440
even for yourself can be really hard and

00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:30,530
luckily for me I have lots of examples

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,419
from xkcd that convey this in a very

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,329
funny way because to me this is a very

00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,419
painful experience so this is kind of

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,760
sets up the problem that we think about

00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,109
within the Jupiter community and I want

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,180
you all to keep this in mind as we go

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:49,489
along during this talk ok so I'm going

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,530
to talk a little bit about teaching

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,510
middle schoolers and high schoolers and

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,989
also talk a little bit about a workshop

00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:00,650
that I taught the summer and let's get

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:03,500
started so learning and computational

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:08,810
ideas are really the core of what

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:11,810
Jupiter is best at and one of the things

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,229
that Herbert Simon who is a cognitive

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,820
scientist had said is learning results

00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:19,639
from what a student does in thinks and

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,000
only what the student doesn't thinks so

00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,090
as teachers or educators we can guide we

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,550
can encourage but ultimately it's up to

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,000
what the student does

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,160
and for them to be successful and as

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,919
teachers we want to minimize the pain

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,289
along the way because if we have hurdles

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,780
or barriers we're gonna lose more

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:46,569
students at each time some students

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,150
learn from sort of a top-down conceptual

00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:53,289
experiences in their lifetime approach

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:56,349
while others are more driven by the

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:59,949
senses and what's happening around them

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:05,020
now an effective learning typically

00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:08,259
includes both when I plan workshops I

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,169
typically try and go for think about the

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:13,720
audience that I'm delivering the

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:18,090
workshop to you try and find the best

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,620
content that I can find use recently

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,030
mostly Jupiter notebooks but some other

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,819
things as well which I'll talk about in

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:28,330
a minute and then I try and get feedback

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:33,580
after each workshop and then iterate

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,110
enough to smooth out the rough points

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,789
that I might have had that I felt like

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,229
didn't work well with the students or

00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:40,229
they flat-out told me didn't work well

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:46,900
one of the workshops I've done out in

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,690
the community is a series of notebooks

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,479
that have to do with music and what I

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,139
was trying to do was show teachers that

00:05:52,479 --> 00:06:00,099
you can have multi disciplines in a

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:03,759
series of notebooks and I think this one

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:06,009
was eight notebooks and it started with

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,099
like the theremin it embedded some

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:12,130
YouTube videos it embedded some data

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:14,190
science digital signal processing it

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:18,810
talked a little bit about programming

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:22,509
docstrings I used the Rhys plug-in which

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,139
Tom Ian Avila has written and that

00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:29,099
allows you to present from the notebook

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,449
and sort of guided them through that

00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:35,229
some of the other notebooks I had where

00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:38,199
was using music 21 was using

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:43,749
some other Python libraries that let you

00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:47,020
visualize music and I think what I was

00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:51,729
trying to do was combine history music

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:54,340
and computing all together so one of the

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:57,610
things that I said is really important

00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,039
as I look for really good content and if

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,289
I were to do a data science class right

00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,180
now I would probably look to the

00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:08,310
California Academy of Science they have

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,860
a really great open-source content on

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,800
taking data and making predictions with

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,069
it and using it to do citizen science

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,199
but they don't have any notebooks so to

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:23,409
take the existing content which is open

00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,029
source and make notebooks for it they've

00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,879
done a much better job than I could ever

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:31,330
do myself to put together the

00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,930
information and it gives students a way

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:40,330
to use some of the content that they've

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:42,550
provided after the workshop Quan econ if

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,180
you haven't seen it is one of the best

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,360
examples of a comprehensive course aimed

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,759
more at grad student economists

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,620
economics students but also there

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,029
they've got some great tooling around it

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,169
so I encourage you to take a look at

00:07:55,029 --> 00:08:01,539
that and I will will make sure the slide

00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,060
deck is up but later so if you miss a

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:07,719
photo please know that you can get the

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:12,990
information still Jason more some of you

00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:18,189
were in the panel earlier he actually

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:22,149
has taken a classic dynamics textbook

00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:25,060
and put together a really powerful

00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:28,599
visualization for each lesson that he

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,520
teaches and this one unfortunately

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:33,300
Google slides didn't embed gifts well

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,120
but it basically shows you how the

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,310
little wagon car thing rolls along and

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,219
what happens when you have different

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,930
friction or you know if you had

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,339
different sized wheels or whatever and

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,630
he's got some with Springs and some

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:48,910
really cool stuff

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,709
and I think it's important because it

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:55,690
hooks kids or adults for that matter

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:59,230
quickly and then engages them and

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,420
wanting to do additional content all of

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:05,649
the stuff that he does is open access

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,560
which is fabulous and one of the ways

00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:12,220
that I learned about Jason's work was

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,970
probably 2013-2014 I took a workshop

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,889
from him at SCI PI and he had a series

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,430
of notebooks demonstrating what you

00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:25,480
could do with simp I Sai can't learn I

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:28,029
think and PI died which is a Python

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,329
dynamics library and he went through in

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:34,750
a series of notebooks and the the end

00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:36,910
goal was to see how a human being stands

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,819
and balances and went through the

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:43,240
different forces using simpie to do the

00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:45,910
equations doing another notebook that

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,680
added the calculations and ultimately

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:52,930
you got to the end where you had this

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:58,689
lovely animation of the person either

00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:02,410
standing or not I talked earlier about

00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:05,680
finding things that explore students

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,139
interests and some good resources not

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,910
exclusively but those are some good

00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:13,029
resources the gallery of interesting

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,540
notebooks there's some ipython books on

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,430
github there's also a github trending

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,759
notebook search so you can see what's

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,100
very popular out there it probably works

00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,740
better for those that are in you know

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,730
undergrad and grad school teaching but

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:33,399
you know you never know I want to also

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,620
for those that aren't aware PI video org

00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:40,079
is something in the Python community

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:43,839
that catalogs and offers all the Python

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,110
conference videos and both talks and

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,810
tutorials so if there's a subject that

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:53,079
you want to learn more about I highly

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,990
encourage you to look there and the

00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:59,500
Peter Norvig example is actually just

00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,860
kind of fun okay so I talked a little

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,410
bit

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:08,260
the music already the summer I agreed to

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,800
teach a workshop for the epic program at

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,500
Cal Poly and when I agreed to do it I

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,740
said I'll do interactivity in computer

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,680
science what I didn't realize when I

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,330
committed to doing it was the makeup of

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,010
the students that were going to be in

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,980
the class I knew that they were gonna be

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:30,430
middle schoolers and high schoolers I

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,070
knew I would have a two-hour block with

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:37,840
which to teach the workshop what I

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,740
didn't know was 80% of them were Dual

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,790
Language Learners

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:47,590
and a variety of different exposure to

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,260
computer science and I would probably

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:53,140
have like 26 kids in each workshop and

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,860
it was just me so not a whole lot of

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,410
one-to-one initially so I thought really

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,730
long and hard and I was like okay what

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,320
would interest high schoolers and I kind

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,790
of came up with a schedule which was

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:12,610
pretty tight but not as strictly as here

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:16,020
- as the timings here would thing but

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,720
first I talked about the people that do

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,100
computer science and pulling a lot of

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,990
different people from different

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,390
backgrounds who are friends of mine and

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,390
the Python community and just sort of

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,600
showed the students that there are

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,190
people out there doing computer science

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,070
that perhaps had a similar background

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,470
that they had we also talked a little

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,430
bit about the variety of careers that

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,800
students could pursue using computer

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,540
science and they weren't just technical

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,700
it's like okay if your interests are art

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,690
you might really like computer design

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:55,690
game design graphics design and then

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,210
what I wanted to do is get their hands

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,700
on the keyboard as quickly as possible

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:05,530
and let them really go to town so Google

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,820
Doodles there's many of them that are

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,620
interactive so what I had them do is

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,130
take at least two Google Doodles play

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,490
with it

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:19,210
for a few minutes and then as they were

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:21,940
doing that think about the design of the

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,160
doodle what they would change what they

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,520
liked about the interactivity what they

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,490
liked about the game and then at the end

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,290
of it we kind of did like the you know

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,350
shout out okay what did you like what

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:38,470
didn't you like and I was like make as

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,840
much noise as you want and because a lot

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,150
of it has a video audio to go along with

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,670
video and so that was really powerful

00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,550
and that got them thinking about the

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,410
possibilities and then what I did is

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,070
instead of teaching Python

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:58,720
I actually took p5.js which is a

00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:01,750
processing language that is written for

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,820
JavaScript it has an alpha interface

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,880
right now which is like a three windowed

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:12,430
interface that lets them execute code

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:15,850
and right there and see the impact in

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,720
the window on the top right and one of

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,940
the nice things about p5.js is it had

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,960
Spanish translations for everything and

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:28,690
it had built-in examples now remember I

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,810
said we had different levels of students

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,760
abilities so I had to think okay what

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,450
would be suitable for complete beginners

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,370
all the way to potentially kids that

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:42,070
really were already coding in some

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,020
language and so what I would do is I

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,630
would kind of guide them sort of like we

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,090
do at PyCon with some of the tutorials

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:51,460
you know start with some examples and

00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,740
then say okay this is really all I

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,410
expect you to do but if you finished

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,620
that here are some other things to look

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,440
at and try and basically somebody

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,960
earlier had said you know take something

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,720
change the numbers see what happens I

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,300
think it was Rob and his dock and and

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,940
that's what they did and we sort of

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,550
spent like five minutes here on one

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:20,170
topic like maybe shapes five minutes on

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,680
you know colors or animation and they

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,390
learned a lot just by putting their

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,790
hands on the keyboards

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,010
and then I spent some time letting

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,170
exposing them to Jupiter notebooks and

00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:36,460
in particular some notebooks we have on

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,660
my binder org which basically i think

00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,460
jessica is going to talk a little more

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,320
about it later so i'll leave what it is

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,110
but it they don't have to install

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,250
anything so I knew that I needed a

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,010
workshop that didn't require

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:52,060
installation and then what we talked

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,950
about was next steps and by the time we

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,170
were done at three or the end of two

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,300
hours we pretty much had to kick them

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,700
out of the room they were that engaged

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,200
and for those of you that have taught

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,630
middle schoolers or high schoolers

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,910
that's a pretty good accomplishment

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:10,780
it means they really were into the

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:16,000
material and they all left or most of

00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:18,490
them left with you know a link to if

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,190
you're a simple Hugo website that I put

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,260
up that had all the information about

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,380
what they had done and where they could

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,780
find it again that had the different

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,760
projects that kind of named each thing

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,140
as like a project so that they would

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,320
have a sense of accomplishment

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:38,680
as they went through it and I won't say

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,930
it's great content from like a teacher's

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,570
perspective I mean it was good I'm not

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,670
trained as a teacher I've just taught a

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,580
lot of outreach programs for middle

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,230
schoolers and high schoolers but I took

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,610
it as a good sign that they enjoyed it

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:57,820
and they learned stem and now we're

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,590
gonna switch a little bit to Eric who's

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,080
been doing a lot of work with teaching

00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,650
using Jupiter hub and thank you for

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,650
listening to me

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:14,370
thank you so I want to help you

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:18,120
experience beauty rap and what it can

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:20,069
accomplish my binder can accomplish very

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,079
similar things but if you want to have

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,179
persistent storage that the users can

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,350
come back to the same implication and

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,460
have the same files they have previously

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:33,679
you need something more

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:36,720
this is cubes irhab that I've set up and

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,230
this way you can have this many students

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,740
and they can come back work with the

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,179
same files store the files they have

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:50,700
closed it down come back and have them

00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:54,330
all again technical details I'm gonna

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:57,059
leave these things out because when I

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,250
worked as a teacher I wanted this so I

00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:04,230
set it up but it took a lot of time and

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:05,940
I wish that you request instead I want

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,610
my school to have this I want my

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,040
university to have this start a demand

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,020
for things like this don't take it up

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,630
too much on yourself you can try it out

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,520
but don't say oh this I will maintain

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:22,740
this for my school I wouldn't recommend

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,510
it but if you wanna leave a

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,990
recommendation for someone within the

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:31,799
school to do so there are the littlest

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:35,100
you've your hub which is will be run on

00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,900
one machine and you can go to this web

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,929
page and you will get more information

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,450
on how to set this up and there is also

00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,910
the bigger Jupiter hub which is part of

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,700
the serial to youth your hub you ever

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:53,090
need this project and there is a guide

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:56,549
and this guide is referencing there also

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:59,669
now I will go to a demo of using this

00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,919
bigger deployment so after the talk I

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,830
invite you all to try exactly what I'm

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,540
gonna do right now and hopefully I will

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,200
be able to host all of you at the same

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,290
time and you can log in using any Google

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:19,020
account and this is what I will do now

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:20,130
and show you address later okay so I'm

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,500
already logged in so I

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:27,390
gonna log outs to make sure you get to

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:30,030
see somewhat similar thing you visit a

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,800
webpage and you simply press fabien and

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,020
this is the experience I wanted for my

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,590
students because I tried to make them

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,330
install this on their own but since I

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:44,910
was a math and physics teacher in high

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:46,710
school it is not the main content to do

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,350
programming and computational thinking

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,830
so this had to be quick

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,570
we couldn't set this up to handle a

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,990
whole course of it and it would be okay

00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:01,020
perhaps to take that time but this had

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,750
to be a smaller part it had to be quick

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,690
so this is something similar that I got

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:10,080
running for them they log in and they

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:12,930
have access to things if you would do

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,270
this later you will find a folder which

00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,310
says read me you can open it and you

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,700
will find our readme you can open it as

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,770
well

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,040
this is what you will see and I will

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:26,400
show you for demo

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,340
notebooks that I have been made and

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:35,010
let's see let's start with the use PDF

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:39,060
instructions demo so let us not read you

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:42,090
let us not invent everything again let

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,910
us use great educational materials and a

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:48,720
friend of mine in Sweden a teacher has

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:52,500
made a big PDF with a lot of exercises

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,750
to do programming in math so the book is

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,750
called programming in maps but it's

00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:00,780
Swedish though so let's download this

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:07,740
from the notebook downloaded and saved

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:10,440
let's open it wrong folder I will make

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:20,510
this slightly bigger if I can cannot

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:30,990
okay can use PDF instructions

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:33,660
okay and I will open the PDF like this

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:37,230
and what I'm suggesting is that you can

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:42,270
have a PDF next to since this is a book

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:50,390
about programming instructions I'm

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:56,340
trying to drag it okay

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:58,640
I'd like a mouse I managed victory and I

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:01,860
will work

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,380
so the way I'm imagine you could use a

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:07,200
PDF like this is you will take an

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:11,100
exercise look at it read it and for

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:15,150
example on page 27 there are great

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:18,090
exercises so let's use them this is the

00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:21,180
exercise and this is my my workbook and

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:24,530
as a student I could implement the code

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:28,770
that are suggested I should do and voila

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:32,070
and what more can you do as a teacher

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:36,900
using if two notebooks well you can also

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,850
let's go to read me and I made as a math

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,650
teacher I wanted my students to practice

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,480
practice practice on very simple things

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,700
so they don't have to think about them

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,910
for example how to differentiate and

00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:51,330
integrate what are the rules so I made a

00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:55,890
notebook that uses simple and some latex

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,960
to generate stencils and some

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:03,600
instructions and I run all this code

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:08,330
writing a PDF to PDFs were created let's

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,330
look at them generate stencils output

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:18,500
another one here these are the generated

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:21,720
stencils that you can then print out and

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,190
just train train train on the very

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,360
basics so you don't have to think about

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:31,110
it anymore and what do you say a

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,700
solution which these are randomly

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,639
generated so

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,909
make the students they can cheat they

00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:45,809
can they just have their own stencil

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:47,879
okay let's go read me my main notebook

00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,289
that I spent most time with because I

00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:51,389
wanted to showcase to my school that

00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:54,269
this is possible to create great content

00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:56,249
so I put a lot of effort in trying to

00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:58,169
help my high school students that had

00:23:56,249 --> 00:24:02,009
learned about how to differentiate and

00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:04,489
stuff what are the basic concepts or

00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:06,869
which is used in machine learning and

00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:09,389
there is an old riff called gradient

00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:13,830
descent so this notebook contains some

00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:16,679
videos so I hope to make the students

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,940
interested why should they care about

00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,149
machine learning well

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,460
because computers are beating humans in

00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:24,389
computer games they care about

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:31,799
helicopter starting fighting in such

00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:36,600
things and if you have the

00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:39,269
infrastructure to to use a notebook on a

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,029
large scale the educational content you

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:45,090
create has so much more value than if it

00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:47,249
would be used on a small scale right so

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,379
if you are able to scale something up

00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:52,049
you're able to produce even higher

00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:53,850
quality content and this is my best

00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:56,639
attempt on this so far but I've learned

00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,179
a lot since and so I provide some

00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:02,340
structure to create 3d graphics from a

00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,070
mathematical function that the user is

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,649
supposed to define themselves and if

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,869
they do it right they get pass if they

00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:11,940
do it wrong they change the function to

00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:15,239
something that wasn't specified they

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:20,970
fail and can see another output let me

00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:23,009
return this so I so it says begin

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,059
solution end solution there it's because

00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:31,669
this is a teacher version which is

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:33,749
containing an example correct answer

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:38,770
which will be stripped out to the

00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:41,610
students so in this notebook I

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,810
it is possible I think to combine

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:47,010
educational content that is great

00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:49,990
make something even greater and

00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:54,550
hopefully make it available to as many

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:57,000
as possible that is if we can manage to

00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:00,070
select the games that are high quality

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,350
we are able to produce awesome

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,510
educational experience for our service I

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,840
would like to make a shout out to the

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:10,570
producer of these two videos which is if

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,540
you recognize this it's three blue one

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:16,330
brown on YouTube creating the best map

00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:23,800
videos I've ever seen

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:27,340
and okay so if we'd liked to do so you

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,160
can go to user dot SC which is my

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,950
private just have for the moment a

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:39,420
demonstration purpose jupiter dot SC as

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:43,750
in sweden and i would like to now

00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:56,320
introduce yes again to speak about my

00:26:43,750 --> 00:27:02,470
binder so just to show pounds how many

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:05,530
of you have used my band org okay great

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,050
so this is going to be a reintroduction

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:11,170
for many of you to my binder and for

00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:14,440
those who are new I hope that this this

00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:16,420
intro to binder gets you interested in

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,670
putting up content on biter how many of

00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:24,250
you have published a repo on binder okay

00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:26,610
great so this is this is this is a good

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:29,980
audience I guess to talk about sharing

00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:32,980
repositories with binder so binder is a

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:36,730
project that comes out of the Jupiter

00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:40,690
hub team myself and Erik and Karl are

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:43,600
some of the maintainer zuv my of binder

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,880
finder hub is the open source project my

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,010
binder org is the deployment this is

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,020
what the URL rissalah web page looks

00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,870
like

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:56,040
and so we have a form here the form has

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:59,700
the name of a github repo or URL so it

00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:03,030
takes any git repo and we can specify a

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,100
tag or a branch or commit and a path to

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:09,480
notebook file and by clicking the button

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:12,360
launch we end up building a docker image

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,980
of this repository and get we get

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,980
transferred to a Jupiter hub instance of

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,140
this docker image so you binder is

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:26,550
actually a combination of projects it's

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:30,060
a joining of the project Jupiter hub

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,380
which Eric has just shown you and we put

00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,500
a docker how many of you are familiar

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:38,160
with repoed a docker

00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:41,550
okay so we put a docker is a project

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,710
that I hope all of you learn more about

00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,990
it's a project that you can use to build

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,870
docker images off of any git repository

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:55,320
I'm just gonna pause what I'm doing and

00:28:48,870 --> 00:29:00,150
just go straight to the the repo just go

00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:03,530
to the there it's going to the URL for

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:06,030
the documentation this describes how

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:09,240
repo to docker works how these docker

00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:11,220
images are built in binder and this is

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,290
also really useful for anyone who wants

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,830
to make their github repositories

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:19,320
reproducible we have some work on that

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:23,310
it takes standard files such as a

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,290
requirement text or an app text or a an

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,510
environment Yamma and it builds a docker

00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,970
image around this so this is a project

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,980
that is very near and dear to my heart

00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,660
and I hope that you all learn more about

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,180
it but this is one of the underlying

00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,300
tools in addition to Jupiter hub that we

00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:42,090
end up using for my binder to work so

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,220
this is what it ends up looking like and

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,580
I'm just going to take some examples

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,290
actually from the binder ecosystem

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,090
actually I think some of the maintainer

00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,730
czar in the room so thank you for doing

00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:58,050
this I basically took the Google

00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:00,030
Analytics data of popular binders

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,160
I looked for ones that were particularly

00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,680
related to education a lot of our

00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,530
binders are related to teaching people

00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,930
how to use a new set of open-source

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,480
tools so for example we use binder to

00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,950
share ipython with people and say oh if

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,710
you want access to ipython this is how

00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,760
you would use it and there's also

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,130
binders that are associated with

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,540
particular educational content so these

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:25,050
are two examples that are particularly

00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:27,780
popular so I'm gonna go so actually I

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,970
think Alan's in the room thank you for

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,860
this binder I'm actually going to go to

00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:33,840
this now so this is what the repo looks

00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,220
like and we're actually going to go

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,380
directly to the content so this is the

00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:43,470
URL and again thank you for making this

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,640
available because we are all now I'm

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,880
gonna see what this looks like so I'm

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,950
actually now going to this notebook this

00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,440
is a if you're familiar with NB Viewer

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,120
we're using MB Viewer again to give

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,720
people a preview of what this looks like

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,130
and so this is also a Jupiter hub like

00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,780
experience we don't have to install

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:06,180
anything everything is just ready to go

00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:08,610
so if I run everything we have access to

00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,610
the computational tools of my binder org

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,710
and no one has to install anything the

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,990
kernel is totally live and it's

00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:19,770
available to the general public so if

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:22,530
you're so for example we can we don't

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:24,660
have sound oh well there is audio in

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,260
this unfortunately I can't feature it

00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,580
but if you if you if any of you end up

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:33,180
clicking on the same link you would have

00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,040
that same experience so this is very

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,780
similar to what you would see with the

00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,630
Jupiter hub instance the only difference

00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,610
now is that anyone can put any content

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,430
from a github report we're a get

00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:46,200
repository that's available online and

00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,490
use my binder a torque to share this the

00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,260
only thing we need is to make sure that

00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,200
the specifications of the environment

00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:58,020
are enough to run the notebook so I'm

00:31:52,200 --> 00:32:01,290
just going to leave this another example

00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,610
actually that is not in the room as far

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,430
as I know unless there's someone from

00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,140
the Seminole County Public Schools the

00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,730
Seminole County middle school actually

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,950
has put a lot of their content available

00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,019
online

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,600
I wish that they were here their

00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:17,149
notebooks are actually very popular I'm

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,730
guessing that they're using a lot of

00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:23,690
these notebooks to teach middle school

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,340
students I unfortunately have not been

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,620
able to get hold of anyone but this is

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,659
what I've found so far from a newsletter

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,970
that they're using this for sixth and

00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:34,370
seventh grade students and they're using

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,200
this to teach science across the the

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,500
counties middle school system which i

00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,419
think is particularly inciting so thank

00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,940
you Seminole County Public Schools I

00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:49,509
wish you were here I think this is a

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:51,799
really exciting use of binder and so I

00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,509
think so

00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:56,899
one of the things that I would want to

00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:59,990
mention again is that this is part of a

00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:04,399
broader ecosystem of educational tools

00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:06,200
with in the Jupiter ecosystem this we

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,950
are not just the only ones who are using

00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,750
these tools we end up having you know

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,620
lots of different educators here many of

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,379
you are in the room who have already

00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,809
given talks please look through the

00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:19,750
schedule and go to other people's talks

00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:22,129
I think this is particularly important

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,019
some of the other things that are coming

00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:25,639
out of the Jupiter ecosystem that I

00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:30,889
wanted to feature as an interesting

00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:33,110
alternative is IBL education is also has

00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:35,330
a project called Jupiter viewer ex-black

00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,899
which is an alternative if you don't

00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:42,379
necessarily want people to be running

00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:46,460
computation on Jupiter hub instance this

00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:48,649
leverages the open EDX platform which is

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,070
particularly useful for MOOCs and then

00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:54,110
they're also using NB grader which is a

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,570
project that's out of the Jupiter

00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,580
ecosystem and modifying it to be used

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,679
for open EDX as well which is

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,360
particularly interesting as it doesn't

00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,070
require you to deploy your own

00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,830
computational resources so if you don't

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,540
necessarily want to be using binder or

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,550
do your own binder deployment or put

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,109
things up on binder this is another

00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,169
interesting alternative

00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:20,629
please find lorena and her colleagues to

00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:23,100
learn more about it and again i think i

00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:26,150
think this is where we can start taking

00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:30,600
test questions and start concluding

00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:32,360
please get involved we we love

00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,590
contributions we want to be able to

00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,610
continue this conversation with all of

00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:43,130
you some ways to get hold of us is we

00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:46,050
have get er this is a chat forum for us

00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:48,620
we have two channels there's the Jupiter

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:52,770
hub channel which is for discussions

00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:55,020
specific to Jupiter hub we also have a

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,940
binder channel so if you're interested

00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,810
in putting up your own binder deployment

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,540
or putting things on binder you know

00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:06,140
feel free to chat with other

00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:10,220
contributors or maintainer x' that way

00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:13,710
we also have mailing lists there's a

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:17,130
binder hub mailing list and a Jupiter

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:19,800
mailing list and to deploy your own

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:23,250
Jupiter hub we have instructions from

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,770
zero to Jupiter hub and if you want to

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,560
deploy your own binder hub we also have

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:35,010
instructions on binders read the docs

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:36,870
page and I think this is I think that

00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,520
this starts to get the conversation

00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:44,250
going about various tools for using

00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,070
Jupiter notebooks this is this is

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,630
Carol's lovely slide if you have

00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,910
anything else to add with this Carol I

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:54,110
think I think this is this shows how

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:56,880
much we love our community and how much

00:35:54,110 --> 00:36:00,270
their Jupiter community has been able to

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,670
use Jupiter notebooks to do very

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:05,580
interesting and exciting projects and

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:11,310
education so please let's keep the

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:15,210
conversation going and in terms of other

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:18,630
people we want to mention the San Diego

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:21,510
Python group we want to thank send our

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,030
thanks to them Demba Ba gave a great

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,920
talk last year and has been doing really

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,490
great work and Jupiter notebooks for

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,010
education we also have this pronounced

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,950
okay go okay

00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:36,380
it's okay go and Annemarie Thomas

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:41,660
Carroll also mentioned Jason more and

00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:45,890
quant econ project Jupiter again we are

00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,390
particularly involved with and are

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,170
thankful to the rest of the members of

00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,490
the community including all of you and

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:55,160
we also are particularly thankful to

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,290
people who contributed the content that

00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,609
we were ended up featuring in this these

00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:04,940
slides and again as I said this is these

00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:06,530
are some of the members of our team this

00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:11,020
is not necessarily a comprehensive to

00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:13,460
everyone but this kind of shows the the

00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,700
some of the people you might see if you

00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,070
go and find us on git or github

00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:24,140
hopefully we'll be able to maintain the

00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:25,730
conversation that way again these are

00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,700
what these are additional ways for you

00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:33,170
to get hold of us that I just went over

00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:35,840
and I guess we can we can keep talking

00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:42,530
from here so thank you

00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:42,530
[Applause]

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:59,400
questions awesome stuff

00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,290
great thank you so much for other

00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,570
contributions one of the themes that

00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,890
kind of kept recurring was language it

00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,300
was really cool to see notebooks in

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,990
another language I'd never seen that

00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,040
before but then like you know the

00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,050
children with English as a Second

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,060
Language that's what I'm very interested

00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:18,690
in it how do the computational

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:21,450
narratives kind of facilitate or grease

00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:27,500
the wheels where language falls short is

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:30,240
there some benefit yeah I mean obviously

00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,610
you would like content in your native

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,620
language that's not always possible but

00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,750
when I was doing traveling around Asia

00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,640
and speaking at different Python

00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:44,280
conferences what I was finding was a

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:47,940
huge usage of Jupiter sometimes you know

00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:52,670
the computer code and whatnot is more

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:55,410
Universal or math is fairly universal so

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,790
it was not as much the language barrier

00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,190
it was maybe more of a language barrier

00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:02,400
when I was in Taiwan and they had one

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:06,270
track that was in Mandarin or Taiwanese

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,370
I can't remember and Google Translate

00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:11,190
like we had the video up so we could

00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:13,460
like look at the slide deck and it

00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:17,010
actually did a really good job

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:20,070
surprisingly but yeah I mean it would be

00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,300
great to have like language plugins and

00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,950
things like that and I think with

00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,590
Jupiter lab that's a possibility down

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,780
the road and you know much like in the

00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:31,680
Python community we have contributors

00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,780
that are doing that so unfortunately we

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,350
ran out of time let's give a round of

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,350
applause for our speakers

00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:54,320
what was Elizabeth's question just out

00:39:40,310 --> 00:40:08,180
of curiosity but we do keep privacy of

00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:09,130
yeah yeah that's something we're

00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:15,230
thinking about

00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:16,880
definitely something that's like thank

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,950
you for coming awesome

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,400
please give me around applause for to

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,400
