	Learn by doing: Using data-driven stories and visualizations in the (high school and college) classroom
Carol Willing (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo), Jessica Forde (Jupyter), Erik Sundell (IT-Gymnasiet Uppsala)

Interactive content that combines a computational narrative, code, video, audio, and interactive widgets brings high school and college learning to life and puts students in charge of manipulating content and extending their learning. By giving students in the sciences and humanities alike engaging, cohesive content in familiar subjects using Jupyter notebooks, JupyterLab, and the rich Python, R, and Julia ecosystem, teachers can encourage students to develop data science literacy and use their increasing computational skill to build upon their interests.

Using examples from computational narratives, data-driven storytelling, citizen science, and animation, Carol Willing, Jessica Forde, and Erik Sundell demonstrate the value of interactive content and outline ways educators can help students develop data science literacy and use computational skills to build upon their interests. One difficulty for teachers is classroom access to modern computers and the ability to install software on those systems. Carol, Jessica, and Erik explain how teachers can deploy JupyterHub for a class using the “Zero to JupyterHub” guide, Kubernetes, and cloud services. Even if students only have access to smartphones, tablets, or shared computers, teachers can offer engaging content using Binder, which delivers a cloud-based notebook environment at the click of a button.
