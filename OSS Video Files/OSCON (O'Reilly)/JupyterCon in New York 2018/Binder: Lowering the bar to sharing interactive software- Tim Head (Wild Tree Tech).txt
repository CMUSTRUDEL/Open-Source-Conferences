Title: Binder: Lowering the bar to sharing interactive software- Tim Head (Wild Tree Tech)
Publication date: 2018-09-20
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	The Binder project drastically lowers the bar to sharing and reusing software. Users wanting to try out someone else’s work need only click a single link to do so. In addition, preparing a Binder-ready project is much easier than having to support many different platforms and for many projects involves little additional work.

Tim Head offers an overview of the Binder project and explores the concepts and ideas behind it. Tim then showcases examples from the community to show off the power of Binder. Three pieces of software power Binder: repo2docker, BinderHub, and JupyterHub. Using an example repository, Tim walks you through the steps required to make a repository Binder-ready and details what happens when a user launches it. At each step, you’ll learn the role that each of the three software components play and how they interact. And since Binder is a project created by its community, Tim shares pathways for getting involved with the community and highlights plans for future developments and features of Binder.
