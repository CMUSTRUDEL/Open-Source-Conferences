Title: Binder: Lowering the bar to sharing interactive software- Tim Head (Wild Tree Tech)
Publication date: 2018-09-20
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	The Binder project drastically lowers the bar to sharing and reusing software. Users wanting to try out someone else’s work need only click a single link to do so. In addition, preparing a Binder-ready project is much easier than having to support many different platforms and for many projects involves little additional work.

Tim Head offers an overview of the Binder project and explores the concepts and ideas behind it. Tim then showcases examples from the community to show off the power of Binder. Three pieces of software power Binder: repo2docker, BinderHub, and JupyterHub. Using an example repository, Tim walks you through the steps required to make a repository Binder-ready and details what happens when a user launches it. At each step, you’ll learn the role that each of the three software components play and how they interact. And since Binder is a project created by its community, Tim shares pathways for getting involved with the community and highlights plans for future developments and features of Binder.

	00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:09,720
I have a very easy you would think job

00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,420
to do now because I get to talk about

00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:16,200
something I work on that I like working

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,670
on and that people Lyle love using so it

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,490
should be very very easy to talk about

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,760
this and please the crowd the one snag

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,100
to this is most of this is probably not

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,930
my work because there's a large team of

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,109
people who work on binder and all the

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,290
things related to it and you want to you

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,239
know the weight on my shoulders is to do

00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,250
them justice and all the work and time

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,969
that they've invested so this makes it

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,340
for me a very hard talk to give so

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,829
before I told you what binder is which

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,930
is a you know into one sentence version

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,670
that you can tweet is binder is a tool

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,289
for sharing notebooks with other people

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,620
but if you want a more detailed version

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:02,129
of what that means we have to go back

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,280
about five thousand years in history to

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,130
when humans first started creating

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,850
libraries and you will hopefully see by

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,770
the end of the talk why that is a useful

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,020
excursion to take and don't worry we've

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,950
all managed to come back to the present

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,140
in time for the drinks reception so

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,040
5,000 years ago the sumaré people who

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,590
lived in modern-day southern Iraq

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,350
started writing down who is trading with

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,869
who and stories about the history of

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,689
their people on these clay tablets and

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,479
collecting them in what we would call a

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,000
library and so five thousand years ago

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,040
we already realized that writing things

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,500
down so that other people can find them

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,340
and read them we can share them with

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,990
each other is a useful thing to be doing

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,570
so it was quite difficult back then

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,390
because these clay tablets you know it

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,460
is very dense text on it you had to wait

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,280
for it to be you know not too wet but

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,329
not too dry and then fit the whole story

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,349
into it it's kind of thick so it's

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,580
probably quite heavy as well but people

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,950
thought this was a good idea a good

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,860
thing to do and they built libraries

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,310
that are key

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,770
can now discover and what I find amazing

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,660
is they're kind of thick they write on

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,120
the front and then you store them in

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,940
shelves like this with the writing on

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,440
the front next to each other and then

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,480
you can't read anymore what's written on

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,140
it so what do you do you write on the

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,820
thick side of it a title for it and if

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,430
you ask me that looks very much like a

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,430
book already know about 5,000 years ago

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,560
so I thought that was interesting so

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,030
then we invented paper then we invented

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,220
the printing press so we could make

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,590
actual books like we've recognized them

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,690
now libraries changed a little bit they

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,850
started looking like this and you can

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,590
now express much more complicated ideas

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,600
because you're not limited to one page

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,770
you can have lots of pages in a book in

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:08,320
about the same volume as one clay tablet

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:10,330
and now people also realize that so I

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,220
don't know what came first but producing

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,890
a book was kind of expensive so you

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,080
would limit access to it to get into a

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,940
library back in the olden days you had

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,640
to prove that you were you know a

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:26,290
gentleman and scholar and you had money

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:29,230
to buy your way in so this controlling

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,209
knowledge you know if you're slightly

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,920
more cynical than you think this is an

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,920
attempt to control the knowledge not

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,150
just to protect the books yeah so then

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,170
you know books became cheaper and

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,700
cheaper and there was more and more

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,620
knowledge and we now have fantastic

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,170
modern buildings that look like this

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,750
that house libraries we let

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,970
schoolchildren go there and lend books

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,310
and feed them to their dogs so that they

00:03:51,970 --> 00:04:00,700
can claim that they couldn't do their

00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:03,340
homework and when I was a student I used

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,110
to go to the library quite a lot but I

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,420
wasn't going there necessarily because

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,269
of the physical books they had I was

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:14,049
going there because he had to read

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:17,290
articles and digital versions of books

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,330
so then you know now the library can

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,330
store infinite amount of knowledge

00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,810
because a PDF doesn't take very much

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,810
space

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,740
but fundamentally they're still storing

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,409
the same kind of thing it's still a page

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,319
still a piece of paper even if it's a

00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:38,509
webpage or a PDF and then the next thing

00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,009
that happened if you look at this

00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,840
article that you might want to read

00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:47,569
about a topical sciency society related

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,979
issue most of what you see on this page

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,449
actually has nothing to do with the

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,240
content of the article it's just

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:55,340
different ways of logging in so that you

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,349
can read it

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,750
so now libraries are doing two things

00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:01,490
they curate knowledge so they pick for

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,620
me what is interesting and what is not

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,550
so interesting but they also broker

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,830
access to these articles which in some

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,190
sense is what they have been doing for a

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,479
long time as well and so the next

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:19,340
problem is modern-day

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,379
ideas now I would claim are too

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,740
complicated to be expressed on a piece

00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:26,690
of paper even if it's a web page you

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,490
know a piece of paper here is something

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,550
which is static you have some kind of

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,130
texts and pictures on it but you know

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,419
it's fundamentally the same thing as a

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:41,169
clay tablet and what do I you know to

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:44,810
give you an example of why I think it's

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:47,659
important to think about this is imagine

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,690
all I could use is words to explain to

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:53,210
you a law of physics so Newton's third

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,940
law and if I can only use words to do

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,449
that then it would read something like

00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,219
this

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,139
the third law states that all forces

00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:03,379
between two objects exist an equal

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:06,379
magnitude and opposite direction if one

00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,169
object a exerts a force FA on a second

00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:11,719
object B then B simultaneously exerts a

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:14,029
force FB on a and the two forces are

00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:16,789
equal in magnitude and opposite in

00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:18,979
direction so there's a lot of text it

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:22,310
takes a very long time to read and it's

00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:24,110
probably not super precise either so if

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:29,300
you're a physicist you might have lots

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,699
of questions about what exactly this law

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,669
entails so in physics then we use a

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:37,540
different medium we don't use words we

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,900
use maths and this has to

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:44,950
good advantages one of them is much

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,070
shorter so f sub a equal minus F sub e

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,230
is the same amount or I would say is

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,050
even more information in that long text

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,910
and it's definitely much more precise so

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,100
different physicist wants to know

00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,740
exactly what you mean if you show them

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,140
this equation there will be much happier

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,970
than if you show them the text and I

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,250
think the same applies to modern day

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,600
ideas everywhere else you know

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,710
especially in fields like machine

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,290
learning or data science and journalism

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,450
if you just show me the text about what

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,690
you did I will still have a lot of

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:24,160
questions I need much more than just a

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:27,970
text so then you could say well is paper

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,880
obsolete and this is a headline or the

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:34,680
the teaser picture from a article

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,940
published in the Atlantic written or

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,740
co-written I think by some of the

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,480
Jupiter people where they claim that

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,670
indeed the scientific article is

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,710
obsolete but I think you should take a

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,750
moment to think about that kind of claim

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,330
because there is a bold statement after

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,930
all paper has been the market leader in

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,030
information transmission for 5000 years

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,860
so if you want to put that out of

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,390
business you better have some good

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:06,640
examples so if we want to go beyond

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:09,670
paper then let me show you an example

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,960
about this so this is a research article

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:17,860
which came out in July 2018 and it

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,940
discusses an idea about machine learning

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:24,790
and if you want a very high-level I'd

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:27,760
like summary of what they're doing they

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,730
have images like this little image here

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,470
and they want you to be able to ask

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:38,770
questions written as text and give you

00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:39,400
answers about you know what you're

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,370
asking

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,950
given that image so in this image they

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,820
asked how many large metal cylinders are

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,200
there in the image and the answer is two

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,880
and

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,440
you know that might not be super

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,290
interesting to you but if you are

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,850
research into in machine learning if you

00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,740
read this whole paper you will still

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,630
have questions no it's not enough just

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:07,540
after the paper so luckily the authors

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:12,340
published all their code on github and I

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:15,460
think that's the equivalent for most of

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,040
modern science of what maths is to

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,140
physics is this is really what they

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,410
actually did and if you have want to

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,020
know exactly what they did when they

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,840
write you know we took images and

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,760
rotated them then going and looking at

00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,770
their code is probably the way to find

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,200
out what they very you know actually did

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,720
so what we want to do if we want to

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,300
understand their paper and make progress

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,060
on building on top of it or reusing it

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,880
or even just understanding it for

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:50,140
understandings sake we need to run this

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,510
code and who here wants to attempt to

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,840
download this code and install all the

00:09:52,510 --> 00:10:02,200
cutting-edge research libraries required

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:04,540
to run their code anybody know how long

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,260
do you think I will ask you several time

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:11,020
frames in a row now so how long do you

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,240
think it will take you to reproduce like

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:25,810
one figure from their paper one day

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:30,280
anybody two days one week less than one

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:39,010
day anybody yeah but you see this is a

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:41,320
large amount of time and you know it

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,230
should take it should take seconds maybe

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,720
minutes to try at least reproduce what

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,910
they did because most of the time if you

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,740
have to set aside a whole afternoon a

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,960
whole day you're going to put it on your

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,240
to-do list and this is what I like to

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,360
call the list of things to do when I

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,950
finally have spare time again and that

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,740
already tells you when you will get to

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,240
it essentially never

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:12,630
so luckily there is a tool called binder

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:15,210
they will let you click a link and if it

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,310
all works we will be able to reproduce

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,290
their figure within a few seconds so

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,080
what just what did you just see you saw

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:26,660
a spinner and while that was spinning we

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:30,300
pulled the code from github built a

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,400
docker image for that code stuff the

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,190
code in it launched the docker image

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,830
somewhere in the Google cloud set up

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:42,570
some proxy routes so that in my browser

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:48,060
I can see the notebook that is in the

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:50,400
github repo and I can now run it so now

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,770
I have to spend a little bit of time or

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I spent a little bit of time ahead of

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:59,430
the talk figuring out which parts of

00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,250
this code are actually interesting so

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:06,680
you see here they give the the code to

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:11,960
reproduce figure one and if you run it

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:15,930
you will get figure one and it even

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,930
prints out the answer so now maybe in a

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,700
few minutes if we add back in the time

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,950
of reading the code and trying to figure

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,930
out what actually what what part of it

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,110
we need to run and within a few minutes

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:33,180
we can reproduce that figure and even

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:35,250
cooler is we can now go and say well I'm

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,340
interested in rubber cylinders because

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:44,940
who cares about metal cylinders and we

00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:48,420
can rerun it and apparently there's one

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,190
rubber cylinder in this image so now as

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,230
somebody who's interested in machine

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,020
learning and you know don't doesn't

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,270
believe any research when they say

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,310
anything in their paper and things here

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,050
you just cherry picked that example I'm

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,660
already much more convinced that this

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,150
works now and maybe if I am in the

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,790
business of finding rubber cylinders and

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,040
images I'm now thinking well maybe I

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,080
should investigate this kind of this

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,240
project further because I can show to

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,810
myself that no you can i reproduce their

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,870
figures but

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,240
can also do small modifications and now

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,490
it's worth spending hours and hours and

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,000
days figuring out how their code really

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,830
works and I think that is why just

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,720
having a piece of paper these days is

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:40,080
not enough for communicating scientific

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:43,080
ideas to people and that is binder know

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,200
the magic behind you being able to click

00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,570
a link and having it run in your browser

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,330
without having to set up anything this

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,920
is what binder does and ideally this

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,630
means you don't actually see very much

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,010
of binder because you will get a link

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:01,770
that you click and then you get a

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:04,170
notebook and that's it so an alternative

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,380
title for this talk would have been

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,930
running other people's code and that if

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,620
you ask most people they will not

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:16,860
complete the sentence like this so this

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,130
is an xkcd comic I think purely about

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,080
figuring out which version of Python you

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,440
might or might not have installed on

00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,450
your Mac so you know if you can draw

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,750
humorous comics about just one

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,940
executable imagine what it looks like if

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,770
you have more complicated stuff so there

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,510
are several approaches you could take to

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,280
trying to make it easier to share work

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,770
you could take what I call the IT

00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,140
department approach where you say okay

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,880
we decide all tools you are allowed to

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,830
use what version of them is locked down

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,080
you cannot install anything new you

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,050
can't uninstall anything either

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,150
that's a deal burr there and that's

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,250
quite you know as a big corporation

00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,930
that's a potentially reasonable approach

00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,490
to take because all of your employees

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,900
will have exactly the same tools and

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,560
they can send code to each other and

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,400
they will fix that problem as the

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,130
disadvantage so if you want to do

00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,459
cutting-edge research you probably want

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,050
to have like the latest and greatest of

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,730
whatever tool you want to use and you

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,410
don't want to have to ring up your IT

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,180
department who will say oh yeah we'll

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,940
have to audit it and then come back in

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,110
six months time and you like well I

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,230
don't have time for this

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,240
so in research much more frequently you

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,500
have the Wild West approach where

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,620
anybody or everybody chooses what they

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,450
do without any coordination with others

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,450
and then the problem is you need to

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,280
exchange emails for weeks on trying to

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,040
figure out which hidden variable

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:46,030
somewhere allows them to run their code

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,310
and stops you from doing this and one

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,550
solution to this problem is that you

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,770
ship everything how you build a

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,570
ginormous virtual machine and tell

00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,580
people yeah just download this 20 gig

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,040
thing and then you will be able to run

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,230
my code and then unsurprisingly not very

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,790
many people do that so you can do maybe

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,920
a little bit better with something like

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,900
docker then you only send a 10 gigabyte

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,610
image to people but you know you

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,680
probably still need heavy lifting

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,530
equipment like this so if you're

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,740
interested is I think the biggest

00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:20,410
lifting boat or ship in the world and

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,180
it's you know submerse is itself and

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,890
then floats underneath the drilling

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,220
platform and then it lifts it out and

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,540
transports it around the world so

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,140
approximately that level of heavy

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,270
lifting you will need no so there's

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,330
another way which I called IKEA manual

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,360
approach so I send you a manual that

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,020
instructs you on how to construct the

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,540
environment in which the code runs and

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,480
the IKEA manual can be followed by most

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,730
people in the world to build

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,410
surprisingly sophisticated furniture

00:16:51,730 --> 00:17:00,700
even though none of us know anything

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:03,040
about building furniture so in you know

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:06,040
back in the computer world then this is

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,260
called docker files which i think is or

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,750
in binder we think is the best approach

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,480
of how to share with other people how to

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:18,100
construct the environment in which to

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:22,000
run your code so there's one problem

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,490
with docker files there are text files

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,220
so you write the commands you want to

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,650
have executed in them so crafting good

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,890
docker file requires a surprising amount

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:37,780
of skill and expertise that most people

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:40,240
don't have and also the I wouldn't say

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,140
it's correct but a very good way to

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,870
install a tool called less is

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,150
these six lines of code in your docker

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,860
file and not very many people know that

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,590
you should probably write all of this

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,810
and certainly most people wouldn't wipe

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:58,050
all of this every time they construct a

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,580
docker file so in some sense that is

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,130
like writing down stuff on clay tablets

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,740
in principle it's possible to write you

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,900
know worn piece on clay tablets in

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,350
practice you're probably not going to do

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,770
it so how did that paper do it how

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:17,090
they'd binder perform that miracle and

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:19,920
if you have very good eyes you can see

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,590
that there's nothing special in this

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:28,350
github repo there are no files in there

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:31,350
that you wouldn't normally find there so

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,480
the tool we use to build these docker

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,610
containers for you is called repo -

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,130
docker and it does exactly what the name

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,580
suggests it does takes a repository and

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:43,710
turns it into a docker container and

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,300
repo to docker runs and builds

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,970
containers and it does what a human

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,120
would do so step one it clones the

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,980
repository then it analyzes the

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,990
repository and it looks for files that

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,440
he recognizes so in this case there's an

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:02,370
environment llamo and that describes the

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,180
dependencies of the project and reporter

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,400
docker knows what to do with that file

00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:12,000
and what other things that new needs to

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,150
do in addition to just having that file

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,090
there so in this case it runs condor

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,460
install and then it runs jupiter

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,340
notebook and if you do this you will get

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,680
a jupiter notebook if the people who

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,680
authored the repository cooperated a

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,480
little bit so if they don't put all

00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,620
their dependencies in the environment

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,350
yamo we will be out of luck but if they

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,790
share link with you that they say just

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,590
click this and it will work and it

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,390
doesn't then it's very clear who has

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,590
some homework to do no you just email

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,480
them back and say it doesn't work

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,310
whereas normally when they send you

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,770
instructions and it's completely unclear

00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,300
or most of the time they will claim that

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,040
you can't follow the instruction or you

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,630
didn't follow the instructions correctly

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,050
and you have to go no no no I really did

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,420
it you know then

00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:02,020
have a meta argument about how to get

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:05,020
their stuff from it a nice thing about

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,790
repo tadaka is we constructed it so that

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,250
it understands what you're already doing

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,200
and is a little bit like in a magic

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,210
trick when I said there's nothing

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,460
suspicious about this repo you already

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,680
knew that I was going to tell you that

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,750
actually there is

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,750
so repo tadaka understands lots of files

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:25,420
that specify what dependencies to

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:28,920
install that people are already using so

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:31,150
requirements dot txt environment llamo

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,350
require in all caps

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:37,840
if you speak Julia it also has a few

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,340
files that we had to invent ourself

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,470
because we couldn't find something

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,140
somebody else was already using and it

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,720
makes us a little bit sad but there you

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,370
go it also has an escape hatch so if you

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,630
really know what you're doing or you

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,700
think you know what you're doing and

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,890
you're special then you can put a docker

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,480
file there and it will just build it but

00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:00,790
most people find they don't actually

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,980
have to do that so back to sharing so we

00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:06,670
can run repo to docker with a link to a

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:09,100
URL on our laptop and that will do

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,690
exactly what I showed you so you need to

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,240
exchange emails which are a little bit

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,980
like this to which when I read it I go

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,390
down really I need to install docker and

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,610
then this other tool that I don't know

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,500
and you know all that so the question is

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,540
can we make it even easier maybe just a

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,580
link you can click and the answer is of

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,680
course because this is what binder is

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,330
all about so I will not click it again

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:34,960
because it will do exactly what it did

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:38,620
before so binder is looks like this if

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,570
you go to the front page of it instead

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,470
of following a link somebody else gave

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:47,800
you and there you type in the URL of a

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,050
git repository so it says github but in

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,630
the meantime it supports any kind of git

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,420
repository if it's hosted on get lab if

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,160
it's a gist if it's a git server

00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,880
somewhere

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,160
I think bitbucket things like this and

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,110
then you specify which branch or which

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,410
tag you want to have in your link and

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,159
you can you can specify what filed to

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,259
directly

00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,669
for them and it will generate a link for

00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:14,739
you and it will also generate the

00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:16,840
markdown and the rest for you to make a

00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:18,639
restructure text and make this beautiful

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:24,190
badge that you can then put in your read

00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:25,809
me yeah so when somebody follows the

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,129
link they will see a spinner like this

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:31,899
and then hopefully they will see a

00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:35,590
notebook so how is it put together well

00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:37,929
we have Jupiter hub which you have had

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:42,489
the chance to listen to men talk about

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:45,249
just in the previous no two slots back

00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:47,549
or if you missed it then you can watch

00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:51,210
the video recording on the way home we

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:53,590
come so Jupiter hub is a multi-user

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,720
notebook server we combine that with

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:59,039
repo to docker which builds images

00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:02,590
on-demand and then we use kubernetes to

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,059
orchestrate all of these containers and

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:08,159
if you want to talk more about all these

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:12,759
technical things then find me afterwards

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,399
so one other thing the binder team does

00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,940
is operate a website called my binder

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:20,200
dough org

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:23,859
which is our public demo of a binder hub

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,049
and if you want to know how we do all of

00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:27,700
the operations around that you should

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:30,789
have watched you v's talk at five to

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:35,950
twelve or if you missed it you can watch

00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:39,009
the video so the nice thing is that with

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,950
both repetitive docker and my buying a

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:43,960
binder hub and my binder dog you are not

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,210
limited to Jupiter front ends you can

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,080
use our studio if you want to and do our

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:52,749
shiny boquete apps at mode basically

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:59,019
anything which is a web app you can

00:23:52,749 --> 00:24:01,989
probably make work in Winder yeah you

00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:03,789
can even make webpages so this is the

00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:06,340
documentation for a Python library

00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,169
called Spacey they have little bits of

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,529
code snippets in their documentation

00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:14,019
that they let you run directly from

00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:16,210
their web page and you see the output of

00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:18,519
running that bit of code and you can

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:22,250
edit it and like play around with it and

00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:25,850
this is backed by my binder org

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:31,400
so you don't even in this case see that

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:34,370
binder is involved okay so now you know

00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,230
about what the project does you've seen

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,330
what it's good for now I'll talk about

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,960
the people in the future of the project

00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,640
a little bit so this is a picture that

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,980
shows some of the people who contribute

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,390
to the project because as I said at the

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,630
very beginning there's actually a large

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,790
number of people behind this project and

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,200
not all of them are on this picture

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,630
because this picture only captures

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,910
people who somehow leave a trace in our

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,200
github history and there's lots of

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,350
people who do things which are not

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,390
captured in the github history and we

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,120
would love you to join us so you can

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:12,020
come and chat with us on get get er you

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,640
can file issues on the repo you can make

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,770
pull requests and change it if you want

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,500
to if you're very brave you can make a

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:22,910
pull request to the github repo which

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:26,380
does the operations of my binder dog and

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,810
you can change what my binder dog does

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:34,990
yeah so I would welcome you to join us

00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:52,010
in running this so now the question is

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:57,560
362 is what almost no maybe maybe I I

00:25:52,010 --> 00:26:00,440
think actually is bigger so now 362 is

00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,930
the number of unique github repositories

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,340
launched in the last seven days on my

00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:08,960
binder Hawk and I looked it up and we

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,600
all had a little guess on how big that

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,540
number would be and none of us guessed

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,810
this big so I find that very impressive

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:21,050
and he makes it very hard to show you

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:24,590
who is using my binder org because there

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:26,870
are 362 things to choose from and even

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:30,440
if you spend an hour looking at a lot of

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:33,679
them you still don't make you a lot of

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,460
progress another what I find very

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,980
amazing things is this

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,279
a map of the world and if you set the

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,770
timeframe to 80 days winder visits

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,860
almost every country that Google

00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,289
Analytics recognizes as a country so

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:55,020
there's a few countries missing places

00:26:49,289 --> 00:27:01,200
like I think Chad Eritrea Cuba North

00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:03,480
Korea the Vatican the South Pole I think

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,289
is also missing but otherwise we cover

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,260
basically all countries in the world in

00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:12,870
just 80 days and I find that is just

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,240
amazing because if you set it to more

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,340
than 80 days we get pretty close to a

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,960
complete map where everything is blue

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,029
some of the countries only have a few

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,510
launches but still is pretty amazing so

00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:29,279
now is the the showing off part there's

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:34,289
been one point two million binders

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:36,360
launched in 2018 so far and that is

00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:38,880
missing some people who turn off

00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,760
JavaScript or otherwise opt out of being

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:47,640
tracked so we don't count them we launch

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:49,620
around 50,000 binders every week and you

00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,870
know it would have been great if in time

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,789
for this talk the trend from last week

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,679
where was over 60,000 would have

00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,549
continued but somehow it looks like that

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,919
was a fluke

00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:02,909
and we don't know yet who was who was

00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,919
responsible for those extra 10,000 yeah

00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:07,169
so these are some of the so what I did

00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,760
then is I went in our Google Analytics

00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:12,690
and I said okay from the state of New

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:16,830
York in the last 30 days who used my

00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:20,279
binder and there's people from I don't

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:22,289
know see you and why crest or high-res

00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:27,000
this is high school students learning

00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:29,250
about remote sensing there's the onion

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,820
region Office of astronomy they're

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:36,120
somewhere in South America the Flatiron

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,669
Institute the Coolridge initiative I

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,360
have no idea what they do somebody who

00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:45,860
has a book about doing math with Python

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,400
yeah Spacey I already mentioned they do

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,160
natural language processing

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,440
supercool a few weeks ago somebody who

00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,600
runs a internal workshop for Microsoft

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,340
employees came to us and said we have a

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,460
hundred people in the audience they will

00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:03,040
all launch binders simultaneously what's

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,990
going to happen and we said well a

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,930
hundred does kind of at the limit of how

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,400
much we allow per repo so maybe you want

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:14,530
to make two repos but otherwise it

00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:19,870
should be fine yeah so that's quite cool

00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:22,000
so I think we can make a claim that

00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:25,200
going beyond paper is something we need

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,210
and that maybe my binder is part of this

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,600
solution of how you make it possible for

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,440
people to access things which are not

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:40,900
just a piece of paper at home or you

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:44,170
know anywhere in the world really yeah I

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:48,220
will I'll just you know hammer the hot

00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:51,010
point home that today's ideas I think it

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,760
just inadequately communicated to people

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:57,810
if you just have a piece of paper and

00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,550
libraries have always been about

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,260
curating and spreading knowledge so

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,600
really the fact that it's not a

00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,990
paper-based thing anymore is not a

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,380
problem and what I think would be super

00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:15,640
to happen is if there was a binder hub

00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:17,740
in every library because now anybody who

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,410
has access to the library can do quite

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,600
sophisticated things with computers and

00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,940
that otherwise maybe they don't have

00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,610
access to because if you think about why

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:31,330
if you look at the countries that use my

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:34,270
binder a lot they are primarily sorted

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,570
by population but then there's a heavy

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,820
bias away or towards countries we're

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:43,150
giving away free compute like we do is

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:46,270
actually a huge deal there's lots of

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:49,030
universities who who use my binder dog

00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:51,190
for their programming courses and if you

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,390
look at how big their classes are it

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,360
would require quite a lot of

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,700
infrastructure to give a computer to 80

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,220
different students simultaneously but we

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,770
just give it to them for free because we

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,140
have the good fortune

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,240
having the Moore Foundation give us

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,880
money to run this kind of service for

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,200
the public so yeah if you ask me what is

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,240
binder doing in the future

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,880
we're going to try and get a binder hub

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,900
into every library so that everybody in

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:23,370
the world can you know understand ideas

00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,470
of modern-day life and is not stuck and

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,500
they're doing that and so there's one

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:32,670
more thing before you can leave which is

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:35,700
you should go to this short link right

00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:38,610
now and in exchange I will show you a

00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,250
graph that you can access yourself it's

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,960
completely open

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:47,550
now it shows you how many user pods are

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,320
running currently and the exercise is

00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:52,910
going to be to try and make a blip on

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,290
this graph and I've spent I've spent all

00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,690
summer giving this talk with

00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:00,060
increasingly bigger audiences to make

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,310
sure that I would not be very worried at

00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,170
all standing here telling an audience of

00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,920
I don't know how many people to

00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:10,820
simultaneously launch a binder and make

00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:15,510
a upwards trend on this and not also a

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:25,560
cause a outage on my binder so with that

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:26,790
thank you very much so so we have nine

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,950
minutes for questions which means

00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:31,740
there's no reason for you not to type in

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,380
the bitly link so we can go back at the

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,590
end and ask lots of questions in the

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,590
meantime

00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:02,580
so we're trying to find out who we can

00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:04,800
ask to fund the cloud bill trying to

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,370
find out who to talk to who can make the

00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,650
cloud bill go away because it is in the

00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:14,070
grand scheme of things I think right now

00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:16,470
costs about $40,000 a year so it's not a

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:20,310
huge amount of money but it's also more

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:23,580
than we can like collect by sending a

00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:25,170
hat round and every talk we give the

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,360
other thing that I think is often

00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,470
ignored in the sustainability but you

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,210
know especially when we talk about money

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,520
is how much it actually costs off

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,790
somebody sitting on guitar or carrying

00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,980
around a phone to respond to an outage

00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:41,310
because once in a while my binder does

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:44,300
go down and that's a much bigger amount

00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:46,050
of money that we need to find and yeah

00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:50,090
we're working on it

00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:52,650
what can you do to advocate for it I

00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:55,890
know send people our way who would like

00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,750
to donate so we get our move on in being

00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:01,220
able to accept that kind of donation I

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,220
think that would be a good thing to do

00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:33,159
so it is super for workshops because you

00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,890
give your attendees a link to click and

00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:39,890
that's it if they have a tablet you know

00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:41,870
that works the problem is we don't

00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,340
provide any persistent storage for

00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:46,909
people so they need to remember to

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,500
download everything at the end and then

00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:50,360
in principle at the end of the workshop

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,570
they can click on the link again because

00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,100
my binder is hopefully still running so

00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,370
as long as you host your material

00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,950
somewhere publicly and continue to host

00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:05,860
it then your attendees can keep using my

00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:09,080
binder until we've run out of money now

00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,490
and maybe more seriously than the

00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,800
answers they could use a tool like

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,380
creeper to docker maybe to then also run

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,600
it on their laptop or depending on how

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,370
complicated is to set up all the tools

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,170
you need you could give them

00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,970
instructions how to set it up without

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:52,240
having to use something like we put a

00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:56,180
docker so yes but not on my binder dog

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,540
if you run your private binder hub then

00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,730
it's not scary for users to type in

00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,310
their passwords and then they can type

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:07,250
git push to push it back to wherever it

00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:09,290
came from there's no UI yet we're

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:13,700
basically waiting for Jupiter lab to

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:16,520
make a nice UI for that and then yeah

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,260
but on the on the public my binder we

00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,570
really really really don't want people

00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,760
to type in any credentials some people

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,090
seem to do it but we really think that's

00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,090
a bad idea

00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:53,970
yeah yeah so these guys from the Pangaea

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,670
project they set up their own binder hub

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,200
and they give you even more

00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,609
computational resources than we do so

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,060
you can launch I don't know how big a

00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:05,369
cluster you can launch on-demand but

00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:08,490
yeah it looks exactly the same as my

00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:25,859
binder doubled but I promise it's a

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:27,900
different one so here we go so it needs

00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:31,790
kubernetes you need to have a

00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:34,440
communities cluster the requirements of

00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:36,180
for that kubernetes cluster the features

00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,640
it has to have they are much lower than

00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,290
if you want to set up a Jupiter hub but

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,560
you need to have a company just cluster

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,660
and then there's a there's a guide that

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,700
if you have a droopin kubernetes cluster

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,700
how you can get your own binder hub

00:37:51,430 --> 00:38:00,339
ah no so you can really use requirements

00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:02,170
txt internally we use mini Condor to

00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:04,420
provide the Python executable in

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:08,530
reporter docker just because that's an

00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:12,490
easy way to install that but yeah you

00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:16,380
can use you know if you're using our den

00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,380
Condor doesn't come into the game at all

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,940
okay you first

00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:47,320
so we have an example about how to get

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:50,940
data into your binder and it gives you

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,440
several options amend you read that in

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,830
principle you can make your docker image

00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,250
as big as you want in practice we would

00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:03,010
prefer you to make it semi small ish and

00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,349
if you have very large data sets stream

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:08,410
them in as you process them so there's

00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:11,890
an example in here for I think G ot for

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:14,109
something on how to take really big

00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:17,650
datasets and stream them into my binder

00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:20,609
dog and if you have another example

00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,609
please contribute it

00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:48,990
so if you don't so it will only my

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:53,940
binder de org will only you use public

00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:56,309
git repositories as a source so now your

00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,760
question is if nobody knows that git

00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:02,460
repo exists and nobody knows the URL is

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,579
it still private I don't know but we

00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,349
don't we don't have a registry no we do

00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,710
have it no okay the short answer is it's

00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:13,920
public who is that because the the

00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:15,599
analytics data is largely public so if

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,030
somebody wanted to they could look

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,069
through all the binders that recently

00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:43,309
been launched and they would find yours

00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:43,309
and yes yes yes that's good yep

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,440
so

00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,830
so we don't do oh wow so the short

00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,970
answer on the thing is I will go to the

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,890
reception so if you have more questions

00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,810
find me there

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,510
the answer to you is we don't do

00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:12,810
anything special but I would personally

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:15,540
love it if somebody invested the time to

00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:17,550
make Jupiter the Jupiter notebook or

00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,240
Jupiter lab or any of the other notebook

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:23,520
front ends easier to use from a mobile

00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,150
device which doesn't have a keyboard I

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,150
would love that if somebody did it thank

00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:33,909
you very much

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,909
