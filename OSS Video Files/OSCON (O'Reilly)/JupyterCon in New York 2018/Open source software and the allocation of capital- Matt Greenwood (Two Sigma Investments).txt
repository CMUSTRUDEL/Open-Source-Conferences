Title: Open source software and the allocation of capital- Matt Greenwood (Two Sigma Investments)
Publication date: 2018-09-20
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	As the world grows more dependent on a shared open source software ecosystem, we all must consider who shares the responsibility of keeping that infrastructure healthy. In his 15 years at data science and technology company Two Sigma, as well as his service on the board of TS Ventures, Matt Greenwood has had to think deeply about how to most efficiently allocate capital to open source software (OSS) to best support the companies’ various lines of business. Matt shares four ways of engaging with open source—funding OSS startups, paying for OSS contractors through trusted consulting companies, hiring OSS engineers in-house, and building a consortium with committed stakeholders—covering the costs and benefits along with examples of Two Sigma’s experience with each. Matt focuses on the fourth point, highlighting how partnerships with real teeth, like his work with the nonprofit NumFOCUS, have been the most effective in terms of continuity, risk mitigation, and scalability.

	00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,349
over the last couple of years 2 Sigma

00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,780
has tell you a little bit about 2 Sigma

00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:15,849
round Abed 2 Sigma has developed a

00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:19,529
fairly robust open-source program and in

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:23,400
in talking at length with Travis and

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,099
Bryan and others I realized that our

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,660
open source program is kind of different

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,630
to what goes on in the industry

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,760
and I thought it would be useful to talk

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,890
a little bit about how we landed where

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,480
we landed with our open source program

00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,680
and what we think companies and industry

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,250
should bring to the open source

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,180
community and you know specifically we

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,360
want to bring something that's

00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,460
complimentary and you know in

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,980
partnership with the open source

00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,020
community so so that's kind of what I'm

00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,570
going to talk about today now I

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,310
apologize but the focal length of my

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,799
eyes happens to be kind of more or less

00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:07,299
exactly the the podium so my I may well

00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,060
be kind of lifting up and down my

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:12,429
glasses all the time so so really the

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,109
goal of the talk is really to leave

00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:16,299
those of you in industry and especially

00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:18,340
those amongst you who are decision

00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:22,509
makers with kind of some ideas of why

00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,429
and how you should support OSS and how

00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:28,840
to do that in a way that's mutually

00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:32,200
accretive to both sides along those

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,149
dimensions of growth benefit profit and

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:43,990
really strengths aligned strengthens the

00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:45,579
underlying key overlaps between the tech

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,579
industry and and the open source

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,960
community so before I do that I should

00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:58,329
kind of tell you a little bit about Who

00:01:49,960 --> 00:02:01,299
I am and who 2 Sigma is so my name is

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:03,490
Matt Greenwood and I work at 2 Sigma R

00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,380
as the chief innovation officer I'm

00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,350
really part of two distinct fairly

00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,270
distinct worlds of the company one is to

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,860
Sigma Ventures that's our venture fund

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:18,940
it's a classic venture capital fund

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:22,260
where we invest in companies at the

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,900
intersection of kind of Big Data and AI

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,180
classic seed and Series A and on the

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,970
other hand my my role within the company

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:35,170
is to run a group that we call modeling

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:38,560
engineering that that designs and builds

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,900
and maintained the tools that all of our

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,480
modelers need to derive value from the

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,640
world's data so there was a bit of a

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,290
mouthful but first let me I should step

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,090
back and tell you what 2 Sigma does for

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,420
those of you who don't know so 2 Sigma

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,540
is a technology company in the

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,520
investment management business and

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,170
fundamentally we use science and

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,320
technology and data to find value find

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,330
economic value in the world's data so we

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,970
have a large number of what we call

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:13,209
modelers in the company who think all

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:17,140
day about ideas that might move liquid

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,450
or illiquid markets and then they take

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,870
those hypotheses and they test them and

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,870
a 2 Sigma that means they find datasets

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,489
small to large but kind of small is in

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,350
the order of probably hundreds of

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:34,120
gigabytes so kind of large to large

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:36,040
measure many people here and they test

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,080
those hypotheses and if those hypotheses

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,650
statistically speaking stick to the wall

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,420
then we will trade them and the

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,220
organization that I run modeling

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,170
engineering builds all of the

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,209
infrastructure needed to support those

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,440
modelers so those modelers of what

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,170
everyone in this audience would call

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,900
data scientists and one of the problems

00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,670
that we want to we really seek to solve

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:04,360
is to make the the the transformation

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:07,180
from kind of brain to trade as as as

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,519
easy as possible there's a huge amount

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,739
of kind of cognitive interference if you

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,239
do data science on things you don't

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,220
really want to think about like how do I

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,430
set up my spot cluster and how do I turn

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,919
on some box in AWS and which language

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,229
which toolkit and all of that is really

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,599
peripheral to the question at hand which

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,910
is does the weather in New York move

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,890
liquid markets or some other

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,200
hypothesis that you might have we have a

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,900
phrase right inside to Sigma and we call

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,340
it conversational research we want our

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,710
modelers to really have a conversation

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,690
with their data to understand more about

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,990
the data and more about their hypotheses

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,510
and be able to get from idea to trade in

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,390
as little time as possible because

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:51,910
cutting down that time or enriching that

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:56,590
conversation eventually allows profit

00:04:51,910 --> 00:05:00,040
for us and support for our for our

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,620
investors many of whom are pension funds

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,190
and endowments and large large

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,750
organizations so that's what 2 Sigma

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,670
does and that's what I do at 2 Sigma but

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,830
my my my interaction my my involvement

00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,500
with open source goes back well over 20

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,870
years I worked at IBM in the 90s and I

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,570
was part of the first task force to

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,790
grapple with open source so these were

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,650
in the days before you know I don't know

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,460
it's kind of prehistoric to what we have

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,910
now and I was involved in many many many

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:38,760
discussions about kind of who what and

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:41,530
why to open source software and

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,500
frequently found myself explaining to

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,970
executives at IBM the important quote

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,480
which I'm going to quote like a hundred

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:53,470
times you know free as in speech not as

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,210
in beer to explain really try and

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,120
understand what open source is all about

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,190
so many of the ideas that I have today

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,640
many of the ideas that kind of came into

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,900
this us this this talk and what we do it

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,810
to sing we're really informed by that

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,660
time and then by spending time during

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:18,580
startups I was in Silicon Valley before

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:22,390
I came to to Sigma so here we go

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,220
so I'm not going to tell you about why

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,900
you should inverse an open source so if

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,870
you're here I'm making a tacit

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,690
assumption I'm taking it as axiomatic

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,260
that you already agree that we should

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,210
support open source software in fact

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,340
today you can't really get away without

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,150
it right just about everything that we

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,700
do in the world

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,890
fairly shocking relies on some aspect of

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,500
open source software and part of this

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,960
talk will be grappling with the hidden

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,360
costs - what that means to an

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,710
organization so instead this talk is

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,300
really about how I think about

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,490
allocating resources for open source

00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,070
software and how really does a large

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,920
tech company invest in open source

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,300
software effectively and derive value

00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,440
from the investment so I'll be talking

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,410
about some different ways we've gone

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:13,360
involved and use some examples from the

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:16,150
last couple of years so actually let me

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,280
kind of begin at the very very beginning

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,070
before we get to this slide so a to

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,340
signal we are voracious users of open

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,230
source right it's far easier to use

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,270
things that other people have done than

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,670
to build it yourself that's like that's

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,520
an axiom in business right if you can

00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:37,060
get it cheaply or freely why not use it

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,640
so by definition we are voracious users

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,270
of open source every company is and as I

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,860
said you simply can't be a real company

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,390
without being part of the landscape of

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,100
open source or real technology company

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,770
and ever since the inception of the

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,740
company we've used and given back to

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,880
open source one of our earliest members

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,680
of the company one of the founding

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,920
members of the company is a core

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,140
contributor to nebby SD but as we grew

00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,240
our platform and solve the really hard

00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,570
problems that we have we wanted to find

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,270
a way of helping the community with some

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,990
of our key what we consider our key

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:17,440
innovations so the modeling engineering

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,570
team as I said his goal is to build a

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,940
platform for these modelers or in this

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,160
parlance here we're here to build a

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,010
platform for data science and that

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,660
platform that we've built over the years

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,540
includes a multi language polyglot

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,070
notebook a way to discover datasets and

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,650
environment for building and testing

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,570
models easy access to scalable and

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,400
distributed compute and then the ability

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,910
to publish and collaborate with peers

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,520
and a key component of that platform was

00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:48,280
a notebook called pica which I announced

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,740
here last year has become an extension

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,440
to Jupiter call or set of extensions to

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,050
Jupiter called bkx and so I think it's

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,790
worthwhile

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,740
just diving you know just a little bit

00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,959
below the surface to kind of explain to

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,670
you the problem that we have that we

00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,640
wanted to open-source just to kind of

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,440
give you an idea so you can you know

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,940
anyone who wants kind of more than three

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,290
minutes of this can check out my talk

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,060
from last year where I spoke about this

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,190
for half an hour about why we came to it

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,769
but really what we see is that there are

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,630
kind of a four cornerstones to a any

00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:19,670
kind of data science platform the first

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,910
is you have to be able to find the data

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,140
which is fairly difficult even nowadays

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,810
then you want to do some data analysis

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,300
and modeling with partners who often

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,300
don't speak the same language of you you

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,190
need that to be computed right so but

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,560
you don't want to know like no no one

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,899
really wants to go to AWS and provision

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,820
machines maybe some people do but like

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:43,100
it's not if I'm in the middle of a data

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,959
science problem I have no interest in

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,670
provisioning a spark cluster so I need

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,130
that to happen kind of magically behind

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,720
the scenes and then finally and kind of

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,180
most importantly I need to be able to

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,579
publish that in a way that everyone can

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,470
understand it and actually everyone can

00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:00,470
replicate it right so this is kind of

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,120
maybe a step beyond open source software

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,910
this is about kind of open source

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,240
science right so how do we do that and a

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,100
to Sigma that's really important because

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,440
the models that we create are little

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,779
pieces of research we need to be able to

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,910
replicate that research not just to

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,640
check that our assumptions are still

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,950
correct year after year but also because

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,600
people move on and when they move on

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,700
they leave their research behind and I

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,079
don't want models that are potentially

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,570
providing millions of dollars to my

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:32,270
investors to be kind of left ownerless

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,440
or you know at the worst and maybe at

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,209
the best someone has to kind of

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,380
replicate all the research I want to

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,600
kind of be able to push a button and

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,000
still be convinced that all the research

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:49,160
is there and be able to understand how

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:53,089
the previous researcher did it so so

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,649
those are the four four parts so we did

00:10:53,089 --> 00:11:01,040
this kind of very specifically and very

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:04,010
intentionally because we wanted to bind

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,300
in a kind of very freeing way that's

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,620
kind of

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,780
a little bit of an oxymoron but we

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,330
really wanted to give all of our

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,910
modelers the optionality of working the

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,560
way they wanted but bind them within a

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,440
framework and an infrastructure that

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:21,580
engineering controlled so part of it is

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,460
discoverable data inside inside Jupiter

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,470
X so you can analyze the data sorry take

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,630
that back I'm on the wrong slide here so

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,060
you can browse through datasets and drag

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:38,350
and drop them straight into your Jupiter

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:40,570
notebook you can run analysis in in many

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,260
languages bigger had many many more but

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,570
at the moment bkx supports a JVM

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,530
back-end and so we've got kernels for

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:53,410
groovy Scala closure cotton and Java and

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:55,750
SQL and magics and Auto translation that

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,220
allows you to run multiple languages in

00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,260
the same notebook and seamlessly

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,990
communicate between them and this is

00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,900
actually way more useful even for a

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,490
single person than you might think as an

00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,440
example I was looking at some research

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:13,210
recently that I did eight years ago

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:18,430
okay so I'll I'm going to take a little

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:20,770
dig here at numpy so I did a research

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,420
eight years ago in Java and I had this

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,450
piece of research in Java that I was

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,160
replicating in Python and at one key

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,560
portion of the research was the ability

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,350
to rank so there are five different

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,140
ranking functions ranking as you do to

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,550
take an ordered set of elements that are

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,770
essentially weighted and then you want

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,020
to map them onto some unit interval with

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,300
respect to a distribution uniform cache

00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,580
or whatever it is so there are five

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,760
different ways of ranking in numpy and

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,730
scifi and pandas and none of them

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,490
matched my ranking function and I didn't

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,260
know what to do until I realized I

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,750
remember that we have a JVM kernel so I

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,220
was literally able to cut and paste the

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,580
java code that I've been running to

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,890
ranked next to a tab I was were actually

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,210
I think I was running Jupiter lab I'm

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,970
not sure either that or just two

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,740
different tabs and I was able to kind of

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,230
feed the same vectors through to kind

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,320
understand actually what what my version

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,860
of ranking did it was wrong but it

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,110
doesn't really

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,959
you still have to be quantitatively

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,519
correct even if it's wrong so it's it's

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,130
kind of useful even if you're a single

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,570
person to have these kernels more than

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,510
that what we've done is we've built an

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,250
integration into Apache spark right in

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,380
the browser so assuming you have your

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,540
class that this is this is kind of step

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,589
one of n steps right eventually you just

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,839
want to push a button and everything

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:46,269
gets done for you but at least without

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:47,920
leaving the tab you can have some kind

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,300
of control over your spark cluster and

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,180
this is a way of just abstracting away

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,970
the computation and then of course all

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:58,089
of the juicy things that you like that

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:02,320
matplotlib gives you kind of but not

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:05,110
really very very dynamic plots and

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,579
visualizations and most importantly the

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:12,700
ability to plot dynamically datasets

00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:15,310
that kind of are on a nanosecond update

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,529
or you know very very very very large

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,380
data sets in a way that doesn't just

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:23,260
overwhelm the browser so that's the the

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:27,730
widgets and then so so those are the

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:29,860
kind of things that we we deliver and so

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,170
you see that we have kind of very big

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,420
eyes we've sold a problem that we really

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,930
believe is not unique it's for the whole

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,390
world

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,310
my solution of this furthermore if I

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,310
give it to you doesn't impinge upon my

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,070
ability to make money I'm happy for you

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:48,670
to have the same most of the same

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:51,250
platform that I have we solve

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,290
potentially different problems and in

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,930
any case I believe that I solve problems

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,310
with something that's kind of better

00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,529
than anyone else that's why we make

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,930
money and so I'm happy to give away

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:04,959
portions of the platform to allow other

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:11,320
people to get more mileage out of their

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:14,199
problems so we have big eyes and we kind

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,820
of got there all of this is is not

00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,980
vaporware it's all out there you can go

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,089
and download it we're like 45,000

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,180
downloads or something I checked this

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,880
morning which is small but we're we're

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,860
just starting but really a data science

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,500
platform this scope is really no small

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,530
undertaking and we can't build it alone

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:36,400
and one of the fairly scary things was

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:39,550
the list of digital infrastructure that

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,310
we fundamentally rely upon in order to

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:46,300
get this platform out and it's growing

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:49,500
and it's really way more complex to

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,810
create a great open source project

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,370
nowadays than it was five years ago

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,800
without relying on some really large

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,630
platform and we kind of take it for

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,170
granted of that large platform is just

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:06,130
there like the Sun tomorrow morning I

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,990
get up and pandas will just be there and

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,270
to a certain extent that's true because

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,240
it's open source you can always get the

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:16,330
source code but if you pull the number

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,090
of lines of code in the kind of data

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,830
science stack of Python that's an awful

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,370
lot of code to look after if there's no

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,650
one who's looking after it for you so

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:31,990
it's digging a little on that so we rely

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:37,570
on this huge infrastructure but how kind

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:39,850
of how solid really is it so on the on

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,730
the Left I'm not sure whether I think it

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,990
came from nunn focus or I came from the

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,060
non focus angle report right so on the

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,820
left is pandas and it's it's a great

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,910
visual I know if it's wares or Jeff

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,339
being crushed underneath the pandas but

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,670
it's it's got a lot of downloads 27

00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:03,580
million code base of 267,000 the lines

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,050
were 703 contributors over the years but

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,020
there are really only ten core

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,990
developers and guess what one of them is

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,300
paid 20% time one of them is paid 10%

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,500
time and eight and not paid for the time

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,280
that they spend

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:22,120
delivering updates to pandas so like

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,160
that's okay right permit me to be a

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,930
businessman right like that's cool I'm

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,930
getting money for nothing like that's

00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,640
that's really good but there's a huge

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,980
risk that I'm taking on because this

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,270
thing doing it for nothing and tomorrow

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,150
they might decide to do something else

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,450
for nothing it's the kind of the the bus

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,370
on the back right and so that's that's a

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,740
real problem for an organization

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,500
to depend upon I heard recently and with

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,780
the other with my other hat of the

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:54,480
startup that there is some company

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,480
offering insurance on your open source

00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,400
depending on your open source

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,630
dependencies sounds good right like you

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,210
give me a hundred thousand dollars and

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,820
I'll kind of guarantee and then I'm

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,660
suddenly I think I'm like but wait what

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,920
are they hedging with it has it it's

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,360
really good when the money is coming in

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,990
but when you have to pay like whatever

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,720
what is it what are they going to do so

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,160
so people are thinking about it so if

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,630
you look at pandas and you compare the

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,860
30 million downloads and the seven

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,300
hundred people and you see that there's

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,380
only ten core developers they're not

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,260
being paid for their work you kind of

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,270
call a finger like this is a problem

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:35,220
we've got to think about and it's easy

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:40,600
to see that the current situation is

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:43,390
unsustainable especially as a company in

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,130
the finance space my raison d'être my

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,470
whole business is really all about

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,630
understanding one thing and that's risk

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,100
I mean let no one tell you it otherwise

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,380
in fact all of life is just about

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,270
understanding risk because the better

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,950
you can quantify your risk and the more

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,440
accurate you can be about understanding

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,960
your risks the more risks you can take

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,559
like that's just kind of definitionally

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,420
so and so you know i would love to jump

00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:08,830
off in one of those squirrel suits of

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,170
one of those high mountains it looks

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,970
really cool but like i don't understand

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,910
the risk there so i'm not going to take

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,410
that jump and we like to think that we

00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,570
understand the risk because maybe we're

00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,240
all developers and I've banged out code

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:24,670
and Python in my life not really any

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,170
good but there are hundreds of thousands

00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,450
of lines of Perl littering around the

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:32,950
company that I wrote once upon a time

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:35,740
that people still curse me for but our

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,540
job in the finance space is really to

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,610
measure and understand risks so that we

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,050
can take better risks and get hopefully

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,500
better rewards because that's what it's

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:47,470
all about so how how do you measure risk

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,220
in an open-source environment this meant

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:54,310
to go to the next slide here we go so

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,820
part of it I don't I don't dance like

00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:59,540
this

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,460
sometimes they no not today so part of

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,560
it is really understanding the full

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,850
stack of technologies you use and we

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,260
don't even do that right most of the

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:11,480
time how often did you do import food

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,620
and you know don't have food okay

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,270
can't they install through and then I'm

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,580
sitting there it's like okay checking

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,500
dependencies and they're like oh I'll

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,950
need five hundred and sixty gigabytes to

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,320
install the dependencies like okay I got

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,940
that space we see this list and it's

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,710
like oh but some of these the imported

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,170
dependencies and I'm like I go and get a

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,880
coffee 15 minutes later I come back and

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,570
400 things have been as well I have no

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,610
idea what they are and you know there's

00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,190
there's some amazing development going

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,510
on to make sure that I'm not kind of but

00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,130
I'm integrating the appropriate

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,900
dependencies and I have everything at

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,130
night one nice environment and I can run

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,220
multiple different versions different

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:52,100
like it's actually pretty cool we've

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,960
done a good solution kind of a lot of

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,570
good working kind of keeping dirty

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,330
things out of our site but they're still

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,130
there there's still dependencies and so

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,110
part of this is really understanding the

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,140
technologies you rely upon and that

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,850
doesn't just stop on the code but you

00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,210
have to kind of dig a level deeper which

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:14,960
is those dependencies that I'm relying

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:17,360
on what are they relying on like am I at

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,340
the bottom of my dependency tree is that

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,920
like some project that some high school

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,630
and Finland wrote in his spare time that

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,810
someone picked up an ounce of dependency

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,240
a core dependency to my system that's

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,400
trading and it works as long as it works

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,560
and I remember once I was talking to a

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,880
muddler at work and they had something

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:40,340
and I said you know I'm deploying a

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,550
black box for you they just wanted to

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,940
know like I really we should probably

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:49,280
have a look inside it but you know we're

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,920
very concerned about IP a to Sigma so

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,700
you know it's a long conversation in the

00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,290
answer he gave was it hasn't broken yet

00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,300
so it's okay and I said really like

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,880
that's that's the level of risk you want

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,790
it's all good it hasn't broken in

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,010
production you know history is replete

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,740
with exactly that kind of a statement

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,150
it's ok until we lose a new

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,610
and then we were in trouble right so

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,130
that's it's important to understand the

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,870
people behind labor code and as we saw

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,179
with pandas many many open-source

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,309
projects even the huge one to maintain

00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:24,530
by just a very small group of people and

00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:26,690
if a core developer does move on to

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,970
something else the project is at serious

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,080
risk Jeff isn't here he said he was

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,750
gonna be here but I'll take a digger

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:39,770
Jeff like what what version of pandas

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:42,380
are we had zero point zero what do you

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:48,260
know point zero point two three like

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:54,770
I've even start with that one he said we

00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:57,340
start 2011 it's a long time and Jeff is

00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:00,590
an amazing guy where's has moved on he's

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:03,320
he's able to transfer but many you know

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,750
there are oh there are very few big

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,370
open-source projects that have been able

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,170
to another one here has been able to

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,260
actually transfer appropriately it's a

00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,850
it's a hard thing to do because many of

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,280
these key successful open source

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:21,020
projects are bound up with the people

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,750
who created them so we have kind of

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,970
orphan risk we have changes in project

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,790
methodology right so you know pan you

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,800
know taking too much on the Python Panda

00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,320
stack but like project is going on one

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,760
way you get new core diverted core

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,040
committers they decide they want to pull

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,309
the project another way many of the

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,970
projects that we have are kind of

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:46,220
organic growth the rate of change of

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,080
projects can kind of go up and down

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,380
depending on how people excited our or

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,940
whether they're in work or out of work

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,040
governance around open source projects

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,170
really never actually gets to critical

00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,300
mass until the people running on a

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,559
project realize that crap we've got 10

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,720
million downloads we should probably

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,200
have some governance about like how we

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,670
roll things out and so all of these you

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,490
kind of have to factor into your

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:13,610
thinking if you are in business so as a

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,580
good as an example this is one of the

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,980
favorite examples that I have Python 2

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,500
to Python 3 right advertised for what

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:26,500
like five years

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:28,990
ten years maybe long time right 2003 we

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:34,270
already had Python three right at 2000

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:37,150
and what 13 14 we well we still have 2 7

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,850
& 2 a glittering littering 2 Sigma so

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:42,070
this had huge ramifications are 2 Sigma

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,990
right we didn't even start off as a

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:48,310
Python shop right because I'm a Perl guy

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:50,020
and that old but by the time we came to

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,180
kind of decide to convert the Python to

00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,490
2 by 3 we had a hundreds of thousands of

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,710
lines of Python written and you know no

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,300
like 2 to 3 is a great script when it

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,240
works but when it doesn't work there is

00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,700
hours and hours a job over migration of

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,920
maintenance Bergeon burden of things

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,690
that actually people in business or

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,570
maybe people who aren't engineers kind

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,380
of don't understand what do you mean

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,600
you're going to spend six months

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,310
upgrading from Python to to Python 3 or

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,550
you know that's a that's kind of a nice

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,170
could be even more than yeah so tell me

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,140
about this Python thing well isn't open

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,430
so wait it's free you relied on a free

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,120
piece of software and now you were

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,740
incurring man months of work to upgrade

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,930
was that really a good decision yeah I

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,990
mean it probably was but it's still an

00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,370
explanation that you have to make so

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,990
explicitly understanding the risk of

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,030
migration and maintenance for a change

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,660
like this are really crucial for

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:45,070
companies who use open source software

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,620
so we've kind of thoughtfully and

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,350
intentionally invested a rather large

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,200
amount of time and brainpower into

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:56,050
planning a robust open source

00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,140
organization at 2 Sigma and Julius spoke

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:06,700
this morning about it maybe she did and

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:09,010
to grapple with ideas like this so so we

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,810
had kind of many many many meetings over

00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,090
the years for 2 Sigma I joined 2 Sigma

00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,460
2004 were you immediately start almost

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:17,320
immediately started talking about it but

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,040
you can see it took us about 8 years to

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,230
kind of figure out

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,360
Parvati's when I joined we were a

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,590
startup and startups don't have the

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,070
luxury of thinking about things like

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,960
this but by the time 2008 9 came around

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,590
we were a real business and so we can

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,419
start really thinking about what

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:38,000
means to give back and we kind of wanted

00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:39,799
to try and create some kind of process

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,500
that we were we're a heavily regulated

00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,909
industry we're very kind of secretive so

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,890
what do we do in the early years in the

00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:48,380
early years we spend a lot of time a lot

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,850
of effort and a lot of energy talking

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,289
about something that I'm going to talk

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:55,700
in about three slice time so I'm what

00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:56,990
I'm talking about now too but we

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,690
eventually develop this open source

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,760
process now add to Sigma we have a kind

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,590
of very key understanding of a process

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,450
right so kind of really you should only

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,360
introduce a process if it kind of lowers

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,980
cognitive overhead like if the result of

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,049
having a process is I need to think less

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,120
then it's good if it's not then forget

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:17,330
it we shouldnt have this process and for

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,090
us the ability to allow our developers

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,700
to produce open source to give back the

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,590
open source project is a big overhead so

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,350
we're a regulated industry and there are

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:30,169
all sorts of questions when you sign

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,450
with two Sigma as you do probably with

00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:34,010
many many organizations when you sign

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,580
your employment agreement actually

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:40,100
everything that you do belongs to Sigma

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,870
even when you're a hyung so one question

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,230
is well I'm at home on the weekend and

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:49,909
I'm doing a totally you know I'm like

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:51,770
hacking away at my Alexa and I just want

00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:54,169
to put it on github and like just let it

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,730
be open source how do I let my people do

00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:58,250
that really easily I want to kind of

00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:01,159
give up my rights over the weekend no

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,950
problem how do I allow people to give

00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,200
back to open source projects where they

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,070
don't belong to us so we are effectively

00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,210
giving up any kind of rights to the

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,340
patches that we're going to make we want

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,740
to do that proactively and intentionally

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,320
and how do we kind of take something

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,000
that we own and say actually here it's

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,220
for everyone those are actually really

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,380
difficult questions probably Fanny

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,270
company but all the more so if you're in

00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,070
a regulated industry and all the more so

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,350
if you're in a secretive part of that

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,419
regulated industry so we spend a lot of

00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:35,559
time working with our legal teams

00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:39,470
firstly to understand the open source

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:42,169
the open source kind of map and with

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,210
marketing to collaborate to to really

00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:45,500
minimize any kind of risks

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,420
as we begin to put our open source

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,880
contributions into the world we

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,410
formalized this approval process we

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,090
thought long and hard about bringing

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:57,050
people from the company together to

00:28:53,090 --> 00:29:00,860
approve in a lightweight fast but still

00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,450
kind of protective fashion and then we

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,260
also have what we call an open source

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:08,720
thread at the company where that thread

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,510
owns the open source strategy and

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,890
community engagement because it's very

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,270
difficult if you're really going to

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,760
engage the open source community you

00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,310
can't do it half-assed there is nothing

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,190
worse than an orphan page you know go to

00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:24,320
some you have any Goldman Sachs people

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,080
here okay so you go to Goldman Sachs

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,990
this github page you see GS collections

00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,850
and kind of not much else and you've got

00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,040
to think like so what do you what image

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,480
are you trying to show that some guy

00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,640
really wanted to open-source his

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,500
collection so you let him or her but

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,390
otherwise you kind of don't care and

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,460
it's really important and one of the key

00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,600
lessons for us when we were doing open

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,070
source was kind of looking at other

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,690
companies and you know some of them were

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,150
really impressed if Netflix for example

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:59,330
has a really impressive and robust open

00:29:50,150 --> 00:30:04,040
source persona on the web so so we kind

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:06,200
of started things up in 2012 2013 2014

00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,120
along the way we found things parts of

00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,530
our infrastructures that we really

00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,060
wanted to open source so we open source

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:16,130
beaker which was the precursor to bkx

00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:19,100
way back in 2013 that was the kind of

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:22,460
pick any big satellite cook Flint waiter

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,710
these are all really cool open source

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,040
projects and I urge you to visit our

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,360
github page to kind of find out more

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:37,790
about them but they're all around that

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:40,430
kind of data science platform so so this

00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,800
is a slide that we was inspired by the

00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:45,290
Mozilla the Eclipse Foundation about

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,910
kind of valuing effort so the deny I

00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,400
don't think anyone's in the deny anymore

00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,650
right maybe there are people who kind of

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,090
take open-source but kind of don't

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,580
really think about it they just kind of

00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,630
but really you're kind of all or almost

00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:00,220
always in the use

00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,610
so two Sigma's founders had really

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,950
strong ties to the open-source community

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,380
and we were very immediately in the use

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,130
and in the contribute really holy moley

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,170
okay

00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,790
contributing community and we wanted to

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,880
kind of move up that value chain and

00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:18,730
most importantly you'll see two things

00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,890
firstly going up that value chain gets

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,780
harder and harder with each step so

00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,640
those kind of loops are meant to show

00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,430
the activation energy to get from one

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,440
step to another at the same time as you

00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,210
approach open source involvement from a

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,760
strategic kind of business driven

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:39,490
direction your hidden risk decreases so

00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,770
stage one was kind of use open source

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:48,520
and we do liberally all over our data

00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:50,470
science platform Stage two is contribute

00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,110
to open source so this we started off

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,860
slowly we we gave patches back

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,810
anonymously right at the very beginning

00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,850
over the last couple of years we've

00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:00,910
become more active and this is a picture

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,450
of Lee Lee Jin who is an Apache aero

00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,920
committer

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,540
and a flint pushed out flint which is

00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:12,820
our open source time series that runs on

00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:14,830
spark but he also worked with the spark

00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,080
team to get the pandas UDF featured in

00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,400
the sparks 2.3 release and there was a

00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,460
blog post about that I think last

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,070
October substantially improving UDF

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,750
performance and usability and I'm

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:28,210
incredibly excited to announce that he

00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,910
is ace now a spark core contributor so

00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,170
it's kind of really important for us not

00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,660
just that we're involved with the

00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:36,130
community but we're putting really good

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,620
people because we hire great engineers

00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:41,380
into positions where they can help drive

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:44,070
and influence the community and I'll be

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,910
fully you know I'll be fully open

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,260
influence the community four things that

00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,500
we need to do because we need to get

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,500
stuff done

00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,880
so this is

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:02,330
so we're now we're all partners in crime

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:05,270
but we kind of need to be more than

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,400
weekend hackers and we firmly believe

00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,120
that to be model citizens we need to do

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:13,760
our Sheriff leading and what is that so

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,030
the conundrum is how do you gain as a

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,950
business by giving something away that's

00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:21,230
kind of really the conundrum and the

00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,210
answer to that is if that's the way you

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,220
think then you're not evaluating things

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,770
carefully you're missing out on pieces

00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,360
that you're actually getting back that

00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,330
are really valuable to you the

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,800
intangible elements and as we came to

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,309
open source these it was not without

00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:40,040
fairly raging internal debate but we

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,350
eventually did and it was a phenomenal

00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,750
thing I came to meet I flew out to

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,760
California to me for an and oh it was

00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:50,230
like last year or something like that

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,880
on the back of beaker which is the the

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,290
notebook that we had built and it was

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,730
kind of amazing to sit down with

00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,160
Fernando and have him have a real

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,020
discussion about notebooks and to

00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,030
realize that he kind of knew who we were

00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,320
and what we were doing and polyglot he

00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:06,380
was kind of fairly impressive that's

00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:09,710
like oh this is fairly cool like we kind

00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:12,290
of suddenly moved from being part of to

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,149
helping to lead and that really cemented

00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,740
our push from beaker to be correct and

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:18,919
really becoming part of the Jupiter

00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,750
ecosystem so the next stage the next

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,600
obvious stage is kind of collaborate

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,540
right so this is the pandas core

00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:31,540
committers they were this is last last

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:34,460
month I think last month in Austin

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,980
working on a dev sprint and kind of

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,780
what's cool about this where's work for

00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,940
two sigma until a couple of months ago

00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,280
Jeff who's in the bottom left works for

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,780
two sigma and the rest of the core

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,490
committers and so not only do we have a

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,869
seat at the table one and a half are

00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:51,320
called where's an alum right so one and

00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:53,270
a half seats at the table but we kind of

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,520
bought the tables we pay for the beer as

00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,320
well and so you can get a lot of benefit

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,869
by bringing something to the table

00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,730
besides human beings which is real

00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:06,740
capital which is something that we have

00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:09,800
to give and maybe it seems not nice to

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,630
say this but like a lot of money for the

00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,880
and around the table is just not that

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,760
much for a big organization and so we

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,670
can afford to really help the community

00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:26,330
in ways that are actually really

00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:27,580
beneficial to both sides so I got like a

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,680
minute left

00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:33,110
COSO Stage five the last one is the

00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,060
opportunity to redefine I'm on a mission

00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:37,400
to redefine data science and you can

00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,990
look up my talk from last year to

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,580
understand kind of what I think it's

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,830
about actually not data science is about

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:46,480
as I said earlier open source open

00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:49,580
source science if you think about it

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,440
that opportunity only comes along if

00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,150
you've got all four stages and when you

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,390
get to this fifth stage when you have

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,830
the ability to help really drive not

00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,730
just the open source community but

00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,340
through the open source community

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,530
everyone they touch then I think that

00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:08,270
the benefits are you know very very

00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:10,300
tangible so some thoughts on how but I

00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,530
think I've covered most of these already

00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,720
which is good because I got about 20

00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,120
seconds left I think in terms of cost

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,450
functions and the key point that I've

00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,430
made earlier is if you think that you're

00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,380
paying and not receiving you've got the

00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,000
wrong cost function so it's really

00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,730
important to kind of think through all

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,400
of the costs and all of the embedded

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,970
benefits and if I push out a piece of

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,980
open source that five people are doing

00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:40,160
so I've given up the ability to own it

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,260
but if it's good I get 500 people work

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,080
on it for free like that seems like a

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,910
win to me right so there are some

00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,160
intangible benefits and tangible

00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,630
benefits and then there is some you know

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,120
monetary costs that you have in

00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:55,040
supporting the organizations but it's

00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,400
important work there's no question about

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,570
it

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,110
we are only going to get from here to

00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:01,640
there by by everyone bringing to the

00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:03,500
table what they can bring and one of the

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,920
things that organizations can bring is

00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,050
real capital not just capital in terms

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:17,030
of dollars but capital in terms of

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:18,950
humans as well so so our first foray so

00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,720
we're trying to you know find out the

00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,420
best place on this our first forays we

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,130
were wandering around this

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,710
kind of desert now we're kind of more

00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,630
focused on on the maximum and hopefully

00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,640
we will be throwing lots of parties and

00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:35,170
so what do we do we've hired engineers

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:38,260
in-house so Darien sitting in row three

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:40,990
Jeff's not here Phil these are cool

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,790
commuters on panels Jupiter lab and

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,260
Legion as I said earlier so one thing is

00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,470
to hire engineers in-house and have them

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,060
work on those open-source projects but

00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,740
the thing is they're sitting next to

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,810
yous so they're kind of soaking in the

00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,840
atmosphere they understand what to

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:58,270
sigmah really needs and those things

00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,890
will eventually find their way into the

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,160
core products that that way we're

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,110
helping them we're helping them build

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,570
we've hired consultants so that's an

00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,370
easy way of kind of pushing your bugs up

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,530
the list you know I hate to say it but

00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:15,940
if you want something done money speaks

00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:17,320
louder than anything and we had a really

00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,660
interesting conversation it's not

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,610
probably for now because I'm getting I'm

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,740
getting the looks but where's was part

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,940
of two sigma he's no longer part of two

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,620
Sigma we should go and read his blog

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,870
post it's a phenomenal blog post about

00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:31,560
why he started the lamps we're fully

00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,670
supportive and we helped him start that

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,080
startup we're very excited about where

00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,790
he'll go and where he'll take arrow and

00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,400
why he actually needs to be on his own

00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,230
to do that and then finally there are

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,450
things like grants and fellowships that

00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,440
we have never given but that's another

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,660
way of getting involved with the

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,580
community and of course the overarching

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,320
one is to build a consortium so we're

00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,540
very proud to be members of Nunn focus

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,460
and to kind of through now focus really

00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,920
fun to everyone and really try and help

00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,360
them focus in a way that I think many of

00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,340
the people around the table don't have

00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:03,280
which is bring kind of strategy and

00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:08,680
business sense and real governance and

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:16,870
kind of helping out key key key projects

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:18,970
so finding a balance it's really all

00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,770
about kind of balancing it up

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,920
understanding at every point your risk

00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,270
and finding the way through both your

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,550
organization because it's going to be

00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,840
hard and also through the various open

00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,940
source community to kind of find the

00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,430
balance of not overwhelming the

00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,680
community on the one hand but

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:38,670
being helpful and trying to work with

00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:41,070
them and then of course we're back it's

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,060
freezing speech notes in there all right

00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:49,000
thank you very much

00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:49,000
