Description: 
	One of the defining features of Python is its flexibility: it can be used interactively, and it can also be used as the principal development language for large standalone applications. While this flexibility is a major reason for Python’s popularity, it also presents a unique challenge for library authors, because the wants and needs of interactive users often conflict with the wants and needs of application developers.

Scott Sanderson explores how interactivity can and should influence the design of software libraries, details how the needs of interactive users differ from the needs of application developers, and shares techniques for improving the usability of libraries in interactive environments without sacrificing robustness in noninteractive environments. Scott uses Python in his examples, but the general principles are applicable to any programming language that supports both interactive use and standalone application development.

Topics include:

How the needs of interactive users can diverge from the needs of application developers
Ease of typing versus clarity of behavior
Robustness versus error forgiveness
Tolerance for global state
How to make your library’s functions and classes work well with Jupyter
Interactive documentation
Completions
Custom display formats
IPython Magics
How to organize modules to be discoverable in interactive sessions
