Publication date: 2018-09-20
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	Jupyter displays a rich array of media types out of the box. M Pacer explains how to use these capabilities to their full potential, covering how to add rich displays to existing and new Python classes and how to customize the way notebooks are converted to other formats. You’ll learn what MIME types are and how to use them, explore Jupyter’s display mechanisms and protocol, and dive into nbconvert. These skills will enable you to make beautiful objects with Jupyter.

Topics include:

How to enhance the display objects and classes in the notebook
By adding metadata to any output via IPython.display
By adding custom repr methods
By using updatable displays
Libraries that enable new kinds of displays, including:
vdom: A Python library for React-like declarative layouts
display_xml: A Python library for displaying highlighted, indented XML
How to convert notebooks into custom objects using nbconvert, which allows:
Hiding prompts and code cells to show only the output figures
HTML where you can toggle whether individual code cells are visible
PDFs with support for non-Latin alphabets
