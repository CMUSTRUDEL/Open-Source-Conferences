	Containerizing notebooks for serverless execution (sponsored by AWS)
Kevin McCormick (Amazon Web Services), Vladimir Zhukov (Amazon Web Services)

Kevin McCormick explains the story of two approaches which were used internally at AWS to accelerate new ML algorithm development, and easily package Jupyter notebooks for scheduled execution, by creating custom Jupyter kernels that automatically create Docker containers, and dispatch them to either a distributed training service or job execution environment.

This session is sponsored by AWS.
