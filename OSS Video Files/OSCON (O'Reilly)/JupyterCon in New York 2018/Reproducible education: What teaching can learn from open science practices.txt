Description: 
	Reproducible education: What teaching can learn from open science practices
Elizabeth Wickes (School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)

Slide decks are often considered a universal currency in higher education. They are passed down over time to new instructors, given to students who missed class, and generally treated as the sole piece of writing necessary to deliver a lesson or class. Their universality does not mean they can fully replicate the educational experience, particularly in a technical context. The semester/quarter educational cycle creates a constant demand for reuse of not only oneâ€™s own lesson materials but also lessons crafted by others.

As practitioners of open science begin to migrate their educational material into platforms like GitHub and release them under permissive reuse licenses, the possibilities of reuse begin to align neatly with reproducible science practices. (And the challenges that instructors reusing materials face happen to be very similar to those of researchers attempting to reuse data or complete replication studies.) Tools like the Jupyter Notebook provide an excellent platform to combine narrative instruction and code in a single document. This narrative can be written for readers and presenters, making it valuable for students as an independent educational document and a basis for rerunning a lecture. Harnessing their rendering features, Jupyter notebooks stored in a public repository like GitHub can now be stored with additional documents, metadata, and provenance information. The benefits of this approach include:

Project management features support normative practices like submitting a pull request and filing an issue, and they can be handled with direct links to the lesson material in question.
Common items, such as syllabuses, project directions, or lesson documents, can live behind a static notebook link, so instructors can make small changes without having to go through the full republication process within their course management software.
Commit tracking gives instructors, administrators, and students a transparent view of when changes were made.
Spinning up for a new semester can be as simple as importing notebooks into a new repository.
Changes made to a lesson notebook can be reviewed as diffs, making it easier to tell where a colleague or other instructor changed your materials over the course of the semester.
Elizabeth Wickes explains how open science practices can be used in an educational context and why they are best facilitated by tools like the Jupyter Notebook. Along the way, Elizabeth shares pointers and suggestions that are relevant to both formal (e.g., academic) and informal (e.g., internal training, documentation, tutorials, etc.) educators from any domain. While Elizabeth offers a short overview of common open science practices and perspectives, the focus will be on Jupyter notebooks as the primary medium for lesson development and publication.

	00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:06,340
so I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,470
reproducible education and when I use

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,330
reproducibility in this sense I have a

00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,950
lot of different senses I think about

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,330
Jupiter in kind of a different way

00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,170
because I use it in kind of a different

00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:21,669
way my first training was really sort of

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:24,429
an open science world and so I use that

00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:26,919
philosophy in how I organize my

00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,119
educational artifacts so I'm gonna be

00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:32,770
talking a lot about what we as educators

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,489
can learn for open science practices and

00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:40,629
open source practices phone is on my

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:42,250
arrow key oh there we are okay so to

00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:44,590
give you context because I think I teach

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,960
maybe a different population than what

00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,370
people what you all might be doing I'm

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,469
also like suddenly intimated by the

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,910
audience in this room so who are my

00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,989
students so I teach at the School of

00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,379
Information Sciences at the University

00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:58,690
of Illinois urbana-champaign we are not

00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,980
in the CS department I am very literally

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,300
on the wrong side of campus with them

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,500
the vast majority of my students are

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,890
masters of Library and Information

00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,360
science students of those students 95%

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,580
of them are will be considered what you

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,950
might call pure humanities so English

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,070
literature most of them have never even

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,260
seen HTML before so this is what I teach

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,770
them in terms of the context for this

00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,550
class

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,550
it is foundational programming in Python

00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,320
now the MS and information management

00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,060
students that's a newer programs there's

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,530
a fewer students most of them came into

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,740
the program already knowing how to code

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,960
so I get the few who don't they are

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,760
there as sort of their data science

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,080
track students so they're taking my

00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,490
classes kind of a pre data science

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,630
program and then I have sort of

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,180
scattered students from other

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,950
departments my class is a grad level

00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,530
class so I get doctoral students from

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,040
other areas who need that cs101 but for

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:57,700
research purposes our classes are pretty

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,910
small but one knowbut but two rows of

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,770
these little hearts is about one section

00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,930
you'll also note that I have taught most

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,120
of my students online and I actually

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,450
prefer teaching in the online version we

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,640
have a synchronous sessions and I run my

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,790
online synchronous session exactly the

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,010
same as I run my own camp

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,530
session I used the same materials I

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,079
changed my prompts a little I say like

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,120
type in the chat box instead of raising

00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,849
your hand but otherwise everything's

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
exactly the same I prefer the hat and I

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,549
would love to talk to you more about

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,579
that um but that's not the focus in this

00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,950
talk I was given the choice for this

00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:35,989
fall you on campus or online I chose

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,909
online because I love the online

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,439
students and working with them how I

00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,950
used Jupiter I'm not gonna cover all of

00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:46,010
these but Jupiter might not be the first

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:49,700
thing that the students see in class but

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:53,569
Jupiter is everywhere in my class and I

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,879
could not do my class without Jupiter so

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,849
my class Steve you brought our context

00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,260
so a 16-week semester first week and

00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,290
last week are the only classes I have

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,669
slides everything else every 14 weeks in

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,669
the middle of that everything is live

00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:12,049
coded there are no slides whatsoever

00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:13,879
everything is live coding so in the

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:15,230
class I write all my own material I

00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,549
don't use anything from the but we have

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,129
a textbook but nothing comes from the

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:20,900
book everything comes just for me

00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,519
because I have you can't find a

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,859
programming book for library students

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,840
for Humanities it just doesn't exist it

00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,379
existed in the 1970s but apparently we

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:34,069
can't have nice things anymore so I

00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:35,750
don't know why but I work out examples

00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,159
that map to the homework I used some

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,349
well labels I try to use the best

00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,019
practices as I can there's a lot of

00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,729
education jargon in here but I can't say

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,470
everything is pretty normative jargon

00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:48,680
for the education community so if you're

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,060
looking stuff up later I want I do want

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,090
to talk a little bit more about the last

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,430
two so everything that I make is up on

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,040
github all of these lectures are written

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,699
in Jupiter and they are all public on

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,260
github for students I really I have a

00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,870
strong focus of having students have

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,609
their own installations for this because

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,949
many of my students are graduating or

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,299
doing this as like a one-off class

00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,549
because they're working professionals

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,139
and they need it for their job and it's

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,530
really important for me that they have a

00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:21,409
Python they can take home with them also

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,570
I have no resources so I do not have a

00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:25,550
postdoc I do not have the TAS that I

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,240
have are there for grading not for like

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,970
spin up a server for me

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,100
right I have I am just me and I have no

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:38,729
money either so I don't do any fancy

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:41,250
things my goal of this talk is the to

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:44,460
argue that Jupiter what did I step on

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,220
okay ah allows educational content to be

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,830
stored and really common open-source

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,720
workflow tools which means we can use

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,770
those workflow tools to migrate other

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,870
content in which makes it a better which

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,000
I also argue is a better place to store

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,500
those materials so like having an 11

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,690
page syllabus in markdown

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,830
instead of an 11 page PDF for example um

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,380
reproducibility means much more than

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,570
just working the repo right if you

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,599
attended the like why I hate notebooks

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,550
talk earlier yeah it's more than just

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,680
can i download it can I access it it's

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,060
like can I actually make anything or run

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,909
on my machine my argument about Jupiter

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,710
is that it is a right once teach

00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:31,710
anywhere kind of technical writing

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,210
platform and that's how I treat it and

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm going to be unpacking that statement

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,740
in later slides so the problem alright

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,300
so what's my problem my solution but the

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,099
problem is slide decks and other

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,440
educational artifacts that kree create

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:46,680
along the way so slide decks are

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,590
irreproducible education right uh who

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,990
has been ever just handed a slide deck

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:56,340
and they were like you're cool now right

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,500
and you're like yeah I can be that's the

00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,639
nature of this relationship um they're

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,990
really different the problem is slide

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,300
decks is they're really difficult to

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,889
carry the context through right you all

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,110
know who has been to a conference where

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,719
someone was reading a five page paper to

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,599
you and you're like oh next time this is

00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,520
fun they're also really annoying to

00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:16,139
teach from if you're doing a live demo

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,909
because you're escaping and you're all

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,349
tabbing and then I'm just getting like

00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:21,870
really mad and the students are like

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:23,370
this screen is exploding in front of me

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,190
and I can't take notes because what am I

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,080
looking at anymore um and they're not

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,960
enough to write a full narrative like if

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,710
someone can give me a single slide in

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,779
thirty two point font that accurately

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,449
explains a for loop to a student who's

00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:41,580
never used a for loop before would like

00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,880
that single slide

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,030
for loops require paragraphs to explain

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,410
and time to explain um

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,870
now slides are just not meant for these

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,210
activities so we shouldn't be treating

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,910
them as like my course as represented in

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,100
slide decks um and yet they're these

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,630
academic commodity like I'm being asked

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,580
to deposit my slide decks for this talk

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,400
as if that is representative of the

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,980
content that I am speaking to you about

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,630
separating code from examples links it

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,130
really hard to piece content back

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,120
together on the fly as you're presenting

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,510
as well

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,160
cooperation is rough now I don't want to

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,530
say I know what a reproducible education

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,470
looks like right I don't know what that

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:26,160
endgame is but I think that's a place

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,810
you can start heading towards so what

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,290
happens when you have an open science

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,890
person me who is handed a bunch of slide

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:42,000
decks and said make your work kid that

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:44,040
was me a couple of years ago right now I

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,890
understand the meta context that I am

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,240
putting this slide of how it slides and

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,610
a slide deck and presenting to you with

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,190
it so there's a certain amount of rage

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:58,590
like please don't give me a slide deck

00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:00,540
for code no um when I just rust rated at

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,450
this we're frustrated with very clear

00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,600
explanations as to why were frustrated

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,430
and how to fix the problem which is the

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,130
worst way to be frustrated it's the

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,020
hardest way to be frustrated it's easier

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,380
if you can just say like oh man I don't

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,720
know why right um because open science

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,150
is a really infectious philosophy we

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,220
don't just want to like make our data

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,960
set out in the wild so other people can

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,420
check our p-values it's so much more

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,040
than that and once you start adopting it

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,990
it becomes too much more than that in

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,760
your professional life we want all of

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,110
the data to be open in public we want

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,660
the code to be reusable we want our

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,370
publications to be open access we want

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,650
all of the research artifacts that we're

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,740
making to be preservable over the course

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,480
of our career and reusable for us in 20

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,980
years and three institutions later and

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,120
reusable for the students that we're

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,550
going to teach in 20 years who are

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,830
probably not born yet at that point um

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,230
now I just want to take a moment respect

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,480
your IRB and humans

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,700
privacy don't publish human subject data

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,410
please and do not give crap to people

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,030
who can't publish their data because

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,680
sensitive data is real and can we all be

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,730
respectful of each other for a moment

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,960
and yeah okay

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:13,190
tangent over and also we all open

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,490
science people all eventually have to

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,550
teach something right and but we can't

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,650
turn off this perspective okay so I'm

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,430
gonna do a quick question here you can

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,780
only answer once

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:29,510
who here has is like an educator right

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:34,310
like you have lecturer or professor in

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,960
your job title okay hands down remember

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,260
you can only answer one who here has

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:43,400
trainer or training or teach in your job

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,170
description somewhere all right cool

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,980
hands down who's ever been thrown an

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,320
intern that you had to train up okay I

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:57,860
hands-on who didn't answer who didn't

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:59,120
raise their hand to any of those I was

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,800
true but wait okay

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,360
no that's a really good point I did not

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,670
design a good multiple-choice question

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,460
there it was not it was mutually

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:13,540
exclusive but not complete so we all

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:17,210
have to train and teach at some point

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,760
and if you're if you follow open science

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,340
practices or open source practices like

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,710
you can't just turn off that philosophy

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,230
of put it all on github because you want

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,660
to UM you want your workshop content to

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,700
be public you want your talks to be

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,470
shared and open you want your course

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,810
materials to be open and usable and

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,180
interesting to everyone you want that

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,250
content not just to be viewable but nice

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,340
looking to people that want to look at

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,530
it right and you desperately want to use

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,870
the organizational tools you've already

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,460
you've gotten used to in your own

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,400
workflows now there's always exceptions

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:55,190
not everyone wants to write I have a

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,570
massive I don't know how I feel about oh

00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,060
we are because if I have to pay for

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:02,420
babysitting to write materials I would

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,340
like some money it's like that's really

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,630
hard for me I'm still juggling with my

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,430
own viewpoints on that so there's always

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,810
I do

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,550
make everything I can't public but

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,640
there's always exceptions to these

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,500
things so context from my approach and

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,220
how I sort of run the materials for my

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,500
class I wanted to do something better

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,540
than the slide decks I was given it was

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,660
like in an emergency basis so it's

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,029
everything's kind of forgivable um but I

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,410
am the sole technical support for my

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,209
students if I make them do something

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,940
that's not that's something other than

00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:36,190
like logging into your email it's on me

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,750
to help them and I usually carry like

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,890
between fifty and sixty students a

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,959
semester um and I need to maintain the

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,260
classroom standards from my lecture I

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:49,180
hold myself to extremely high standards

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,190
for the quality content that I present

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,510
and have my students do because I know

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,050
the horror stories they have been

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:57,730
through before I also strongly want to

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,330
keep my students in their own comfort

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:06,880
zone because I want to keep novelty to

00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:08,410
what is only necessary right um uh I

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,529
want to use as much as supported by

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,770
others as possible and again I'm my own

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,660
support as well I don't have a buddy

00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,300
next door who can help me with DevOps

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,940
stuff if I can't do it it can't be done

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:26,589
for me like I am my own support person

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,209
so for example I could spin up my own

00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:30,130
LMS and support everything in a

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,990
beautiful way or I could use the one

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,850
that is supported by the eight people in

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,650
my building whose sole job it is is to

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,990
make that thing work and help me with it

00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,510
so I picked my pedals because I only

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,130
have so much bandwidth um I also hate

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,230
making anything simple turn into a

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,330
fifteen minute process so for example

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,970
updating my syllabus in that old PDF

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:52,709
form in LMS involved tracking down the

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:55,839
word file on my computer making an edit

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,270
dumping that out to a PDF going into my

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,459
LMS uploading it and deleting the old

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,010
version like a two-step process I can't

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,810
just like update a file I also have a

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:08,230
strong aversion to following bleeding

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:11,800
edge tools because of all of the above

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,200
right things move underfoot all the time

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,170
and I don't have a whole lot of time to

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,510
update materials even just like over the

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,030
spring and summer and

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,550
Conda and PyCharm tweaking how you

00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,430
install things and change stuff that's

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,680
like 20 hours of human labor for me and

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,050
my TAS to test that across all of the

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,130
different kinds of machines and get

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,500
everything updated get all the

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,660
screenshots updated just that small

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,210
tweak has a massive amount of labour so

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,790
as things are updated and change or the

00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,620
community shifts away from something I'm

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,320
on the hook to keep those materials up

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,970
to date and I just simply don't have the

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,620
bandwidth so it's not because I think

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:54,390
that the thing isn't cool it's certainly

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:57,090
cool but like I cannot deal um I like to

00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:00,840
refer to Jupiter as a fuss list glue for

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:04,250
writing lessons so I cannot imagine

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,600
writing what I do without Jupiter I

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,120
cannot imagine teaching without Jupiter

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,410
even though I don't actually teach with

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,430
Jupiter in the classroom so the caveat

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,990
here this is for writing I don't I have

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,390
novices the purist novices you can

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,300
imagine never seen code before never

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,370
written code before I had to take 20

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,490
minutes to explain what I mean by script

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,210
here kind of novices so I don't think

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,220
for them

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,720
Jupiter is appropriate as a first

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:38,130
platform on day one um

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,010
how so how can I get rid of the fuss

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,170
right I hate fussy things and I say this

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,000
as someone who types in Dvorak on an

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,070
aerco docs keyboard so but that's for

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,350
accessibility reasons right like there's

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,460
a feature I have a feature need the bad

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,750
keyboard and that layout solves right um

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,370
so lectures what a lectures have they

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,650
have human words they have code they

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,680
have images and memes sometimes rarely a

00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,780
table splitting up the human words and

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,360
code as you're writing and developing

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,860
all makes it really hard to retain those

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,430
contextual connections like I've tried

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,040
writing just in markdown but like coding

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,660
in one thing and writing in another

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,250
makes it really hard to go back and

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,660
forth and constantly be copying and

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,900
pasting because I can't test as I'm

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,880
going as I'm writing writing in one

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,790
program and coding in another just

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,340
strongly breaks my focus but enter

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,020
Jupiter right I can keep it all in one

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,769
to me it's an all in one environment I

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,369
can

00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:37,109
I can code I can test that code and I

00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:38,789
can format it all in one and in one

00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:41,249
window for example if I was writing a

00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:42,599
short lecture I work out the big example

00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:45,089
that we want to be going through in

00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:46,709
class so like I'll just open up a

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,209
notebook and hit I have a special key

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,159
mapped to shift-enter so I'm just like

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,649
whacking on that for a while to getting

00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,629
a bunch of bunch of blank cells I'll use

00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,939
that bottom chunk of the notebook to

00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,379
fully develop out this short piece of

00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,409
code that we want to put together and

00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,299
then I'll go back to the top and

00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:06,689
describe how I did it and eventually

00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:09,749
meeting myself at the end right

00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:12,209
my focus stays on track because if I

00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:15,389
realize oh I forgot to talk about that

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:17,549
or oh I mean I'm missing that I can go

00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:19,799
back up update the code update the words

00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,809
and go back up to the top of the

00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,939
notebook kill the kernel and run all the

00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:27,299
way through again with my shift enter

00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:29,099
button and check that I haven't broken

00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,899
things along the way and that everything

00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:32,369
still makes sense and I do find things

00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,619
that I missed right because you can get

00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:38,279
you can eat your own tail very easily in

00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:40,319
Jupiter in the cell environment and what

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,759
I produce along the way as I'm writing

00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,069
at the speed of my writing is

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,350
production-ready right it's all in

00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:49,499
markdown being rendered I don't have to

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,019
fuss with it other than proofreading

00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:53,100
like so for example it's 8:50 5:00 in

00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,929
the morning and I'm making the

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,639
last-ditch effort to finish up the

00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:59,669
context and the updates for the lecture

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,789
that's at 9:00 a.m. I can save commits

00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:05,189
push and run downstairs and by 9:00 a.m.

00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,659
and I'm in front of the classroom the

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:09,179
students can load up the notebooks on

00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,799
their laptops and it looks good and hits

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,919
the hair and I don't have to fight with

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,110
anything

00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,669
Jupiter is also this platform glue as

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,589
soon as I start using Jupiter that means

00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:22,259
I can use github nicely because it

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,809
renders nicely and conveniently out of

00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:29,070
the box so the world of version control

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:31,730
opens up oh I can ditch this 11 page PDF

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,779
hellscape and put it all in markdown

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,840
this was actually really really

00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,129
convenient because I made a bunch of

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,230
changes to my syllabus over the summer

00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:42,000
all my ta was out on her internship and

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,649
when she came back in it was like oh I

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,230
need to review my changes with you oh

00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:48,540
but I wasn't taking notes on

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,490
but I was tracking my changes right so

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,250
all I have to do was open up my diffs

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,590
and review those gifs with her I'm

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:58,020
saying all I had to do because that's at

00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,190
least a normative behavior and not it's

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,260
something that we're both very used to

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,570
because it is it can be a demotivational

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,050
phrase there so the markdown can go in

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,340
there so ditch text in PDF datafiles can

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,040
also go in there because again for the

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,600
data files I care about knowing if I've

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,000
made a change so I can get rid of that

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,890
change and also nothing's over 100 Meg's

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,780
so it's not a bad thing it works pretty

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,640
well also the universe of project

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,250
management tools that I'm already used

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,400
to working with open up for this class

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,950
so I can use issues and I can use pull

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,660
requests so instead of being for the

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,760
past two years I've been like my one

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,950
person dictator over this little ship of

00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,330
mine this semester we have a co

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,520
instructor who's teaching parallel

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,230
sections using my materials and between

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,700
the two of us we have three TAS two of

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,290
which two are experienced with materials

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,520
so I can use them for more things so now

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,990
all of a sudden I've gone from one to

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,790
five and so on Monday before I left for

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:55,050
this because my first class that I teach

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,880
is on Monday night next week I was

00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,100
making frantically making like 30

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,470
different github issues for them to work

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,820
through this week we're down to 15 I'm

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,310
very excited for that with only a little

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,270
bit of data to Sunday so I can do more

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,650
and work flat I'm already used to so I'm

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,630
gonna get back to this right once

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,970
teach anywhere kind of perspective I

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,010
have where notebooks have the

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,980
flexibility to look like you're running

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,500
a script like you're running an idle or

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,660
you're running in a cell right so no

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,420
matter which platform you're teaching in

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,450
and I've taught in many you can write a

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,910
notebook that works for that so now

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,210
remember I write my lectures in Jupiter

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:39,870
that I literally prints off scroll over

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:43,080
with a red colored pencil and haul

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:45,780
around with me in the room I am live

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,930
coding inside of pycharm and building up

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,210
a script from there I am NOT in Jupiter

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,270
or if i--if please no one ever just

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,460
evaluate cells for two hours because you

00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,970
will hurt my body I had to experience

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,240
that

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:06,679
so this means I can write a lecture once

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,200
in a one notebook and almost bring it on

00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,289
give me an IDE to teach in and I can use

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,210
that lesson without a problem so if

00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,470
someone is like I need to bring you two

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,690
I need to bring you in to teach a

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,210
workshop but we use this thing cool

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,760
bring it I can use these materials for

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,130
that you do have to be intentional about

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,770
how you create the materials but it

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,029
gives you the freedom to use Jupiter for

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,490
what it can be and it's kind of a

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:33,710
publishing perspective but teach you I

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,440
should check my time um wherever you

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,039
need to be right without having to fuss

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:44,299
and change as you go Jupiter has this

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:47,360
problem of looking very linear very x2y

00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:49,429
very directional but we know that coding

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,429
is not that way coding is very iterative

00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:56,029
and very loops I don't start like what's

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:57,590
the take a 30 line script which line of

00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,679
that script was the very first one that

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,899
you wrote or you may have altered it

00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:06,770
right if you sort of backtrack the

00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:08,750
history of that code now the import

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,220
statements may have retained remain the

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,929
same but after the import statements

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,370
like you go back through and you're

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:16,220
gonna have start with a chunk and you

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,770
build prequels and sequels after that

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,840
chunk and you're building in circles and

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,010
going and you're not building in a line

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,260
um

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,630
and so you're able to have that

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:31,399
flexibility of showing how a script is

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:33,110
built up in its natural environment okay

00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:36,230
so what this is actually look like for

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:38,450
me again I have a focus on trying to use

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,909
things that are free things that are out

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,070
of a box work all the defaults if it's

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:45,350
fancy like I went through three laptops

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,600
and Latin in just last summer because

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,820
things kept going weird so the idea of

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,470
installing 500 widgets to make it's a

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,029
reasonable experience is just not

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,649
something I need to put up with I did

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,529
recently add a spell checker widget

00:21:54,649 --> 00:22:00,250
otherwise that is the sole thing that I

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,240
have added on other than stock Jupiter

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,279
so what are things that I make I have

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,929
Jupiter notebooks a lot of them I have

00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,940
lots of markdown all over the place I

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,200
have github repos and I have stuff in

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,250
the learning management system which I

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,030
will here by then see

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,940
yes so the new problem with this system

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,920
is I've split things back up right so

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,110
instead of was complaining first that

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,750
like my context and my human words are

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,640
split from my code words I'm gonna sort

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,800
of fix tonight with Jupiter but now I

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,000
got content in the LMS and I've got

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,830
content on github um but it's okay it's

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,850
it's a little bit fussy but is its diva

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,770
Bowl um

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,110
so Richard it all live and we're gonna

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,420
talk about that so what does a lesson

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,300
notebook look like rough outline is

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,370
admin announcements your essays due

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,860
today or to tomorrow or whatever kind of

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,250
stuff an instruction to the topic like

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,480
why do for loops exist in the world

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,970
reference information like what is a

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,790
small pattern what is the rubric of a

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:01,280
pattern look like for a for loop some

00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:04,460
small worked examples again tearing out

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,440
as much as I can so it's just the most

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,170
minimal version of each kind of core

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,310
pattern so they can see how things go so

00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,540
there's like four different kinds of

00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,940
loops you might want to do and I have

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,490
four very small but worked examples for

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,200
each and then in the bigger chunk of

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,150
class so that's about the first hour of

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,040
a two-hour block the final hour is

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,890
usually one as much as I can

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,530
real-looking world problem using data

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,420
right so these are library science

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,450
information science students majority

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,640
most of them not from stem so I have

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,740
stripped out math from this class the

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,410
most most we do is calculating a mean so

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,690
we're using data real data but mostly

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,420
text and banging it around to answer a

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,550
real research question and we can do

00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,470
this in a week and basically day one of

00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,470
actually coding because python is so

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,090
flexible and so I will take them through

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,280
I start with the research question I

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:58,160
introduced the data and then I step them

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,470
through the problem solving of soap

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,230
making that little script to solve that

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,360
problem and then some final conclusions

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,070
at the end and that's my notebook and

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,860
they diverge a little bit but I have

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,540
fourteen of those they're usually about

00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,640
twenty to thirty pages printed off

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,910
designed again for two hours slots these

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,950
take me from an empty notebook to front

00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,620
of the classroom about two to three days

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,270
to write if I had to write these split

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,730
between applications at

00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,620
day or two from that because I can write

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:31,120
so much more efficiently inside this

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:33,530
platform where everything is executable

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,240
the big caveat about these notebooks is

00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,070
they're written for me as lecture notes

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,690
as a thing to be sort of read and not

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,020
necessarily executed I do have

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:44,000
executable code in there I use these as

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,910
lecture notes who literally print it off

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,500
for me much of the content is cleaned up

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,380
for students to make it kind of readable

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,300
I've been truly transforming them to

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:57,800
kind of look instinct like a book

00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,590
chapter kind of experience so here's

00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,880
what some of it looks like right so now

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,290
the text is a little small I don't

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,670
intend for you to read the text on the

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,090
right just to get a sense for how it

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,130
looks

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,710
this is just pure markdown in here and

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,020
that's a giant block of of code in

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,450
markdown the formatting and marked on I

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,400
uses headers lists of various types

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,890
inline code and code blocks and that's

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,780
it I have sort of banned myself from

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:24,790
using tables because if I'm using a

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:27,380
table I'm doing fact dumping on them and

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:29,780
I would rather introduce it in context

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,550
fact dumping is not helpful the only

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,590
time I have used it really is sort of

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,270
like here's some reference dumping that

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,750
you want to use later don't try to read

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:42,290
this right now I use code blocks for

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,330
pseudocode or basic rubrics or when it's

00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:47,210
a small example that's not actually

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,740
moving a solution forward right it's all

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,390
fine if you give me a block of code

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,520
that's gonna give me an error because

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:55,850
you want me to see what an error looks

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,310
like but if I'm not really really clear

00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,320
about that no student executes sit then

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,810
all hell breaks loose and I get the

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,950
world's worst emails from that because I

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:09,620
haven't caught it so um executable code

00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,400
it will often look like this which is

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:16,070
very sort of console like so I have like

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,940
human sentence code human sentence code

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,370
now this does break the train of thought

00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,750
looking at my time here this does break

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,670
the train of thought of the student a

00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,590
little bit and it can make it hard if

00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,510
they're kind of reading it to get the

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,730
gist and they're not actively typing

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,200
along with it it's hard for them to know

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,970
what the endgame should look like so

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,950
that's when you but the flexibility of

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,990
the platform is you slap

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,490
the endgame there and say like and when

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,860
you're done typing this all in it should

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:46,480
look like this and have this output and

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,830
I repeat results and it's fine right

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,789
because these are meant to be sort of

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,799
static documents and not workbooks I

00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:56,029
think it's okay to make that distinction

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,600
this really strongly matches how I

00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:01,789
present so I type in a line doing them

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,159
like the three steps to live coding type

00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:05,419
in that line talk about that line and

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,159
type in the next one talk about the next

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,480
one so each one of these little pairs

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,840
might take about five minutes to

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,159
actually get through presenting more

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,559
minimally so what does it look like when

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,940
I'm super time crunched for something or

00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,100
if it's like a one-off and it's not

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,799
worth trying to like write paragraphs I

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:25,100
will write put the block of executable

00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:27,049
code in there and then at the end or

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,200
bottom beneath it I will have just a

00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:31,909
list of the facts things I want them to

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,380
notice so this is both useful for me as

00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:35,570
an instructor because I will probably

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,519
take 30 minutes to present that block of

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:41,870
code up there and walk them through

00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:44,690
writing that in and I will go then once

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,690
I've wrapped up on it grab my notes and

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,250
go through this line by line reminding

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,799
them and talking about each one of those

00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,450
individual things this is also helpful

00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:56,090
for students after the fact because this

00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,820
well this seems like a small example to

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,950
a novice there's a lot going on in here

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,389
and there's a lot of detail that

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,970
remember they're still learning how to

00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:07,130
look at code I'm still learning like

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,380
where do I put my eyeballs on code and

00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,059
so there's details they will not pick up

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,700
on and that's why we highlight it like

00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:16,070
that's why we teach them these things

00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,480
and so if we don't highlight them well

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,679
think like well why can't you see you

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,880
like of course it's Knobble and

00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,279
interesting that there's like a slash

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,559
there and they're less like it looks

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:27,950
like Python what do you want

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,779
oh no and that's be explicit right and

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,669
then I had like a small activity in here

00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,909
and so this whole thing that's like 45

00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:36,769
minutes worth of a workshop right there

00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:40,039
okay sometimes I do fun stuff emoji bar

00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:43,190
charts are my favorites in here so this

00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:45,260
is some visualization of the Raven this

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,600
is so different emojis for different

00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,140
words for each stanza for example on

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,760
stanza 11 their word

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,550
or appeared once and the word Raven

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,140
appeared four times so this is fun

00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:58,210
data visualization you can do out

00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,310
fighting with Matt pot Lib or you can

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:05,280
kind of do in a standard library so it's

00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:05,280
super fun with the poop emoji - the same

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,260
worked on files giant syllabus it's a

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,840
totally reasonable way to track a giant

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,790
block of text and it's also have a time

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,500
stamp so if I ever get pushback from a

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,250
student about a policy and when it was

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,360
put in I can say like well I committed

00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,180
that change in before the semester

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,310
started so I'm not sure why you thought

00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,990
that didn't exist or if my

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,150
administration asks like in which

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,340
semester are cool

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:36,040
which semester disappear like when did

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,840
you start having his policy I can track

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,410
the history and say like yep I put it in

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,600
then you'll note I don't put everything

00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,940
in the public github like my cell phone

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,890
number I do not put in the public github

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,320
repository I do keep that in the

00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,900
lockdown LMS and that allows me to take

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,210
that gatekeeping of the LMS to just our

00:29:52,900 --> 00:30:00,490
students into a feature rather than a

00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:03,100
problem in there okay so I keep one

00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,530
repository per semester so students have

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,640
one link to bookmark I do need to clean

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,290
things up so I've sort of got an

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,390
explosive number of files in there now

00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,670
once the semester is over though I stop

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,160
making changes and that's important

00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,720
because students will reuse these I've

00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,390
had several students that just after one

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,480
semester with me get Python oriented

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,650
internships and I had ran into a student

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,260
in the hallway who was saying that she

00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,820
was going back to her she'd never coded

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,910
before and got a Python internship and

00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,070
it was going back on a multiple times a

00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,200
week to her lecture notes for that

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,270
semester to refresh on a review on what

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,710
was going on and if I had been changing

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,540
them underfoot the information she

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,850
needed wouldn't be there anymore or I'd

00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,440
have been in a different place so they

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,080
will reuse it and it's important to kind

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,970
of keep these artifacts but you can also

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,700
sort of diff and see how things have

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,730
evolved over time now the question that

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,530
I'm currently wrangling with is import

00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,580
versus fork I have been importing

00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,920
because I didn't want to be limited to

00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,320
how many times I can import and it has

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,200
turned off that I don't need it

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,420
once and the disadvantage of import

00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,570
means you can't just pull in the

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,670
previous changes and so particularly a

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,770
transition from fall to spring there's a

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,140
lot of overlap of developing and there's

00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,610
if you actually wait to like okay my

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,860
last lecture is delivered now now I'm

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,880
gonna panic develop the spring doesn't

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,260
is not hot

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,190
there's because there's like one or two

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,480
weeks of actual work time and so dealing

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,020
with this can kind of concurrent

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,190
development can be a little bit rough

00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,840
also if I'm making policy changes for

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,730
the next semester and I write those

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,770
before the first semester stopped I

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,450
don't want to put that in the current

00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,970
fall semester syllabus I want to put it

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,320
in the next one okay so transparent

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,720
feedback is also really important to me

00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,820
so during lab time students can come in

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,500
and say like you know for that lecture

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,230
that example it wouldn't really helpful

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,310
if you said X first instead of last and

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,900
I can said cool

00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:59,730
let me open up a github issue around

00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:01,830
that we do our private repository with

00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,870
solutions their code their text it makes

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,670
sense to track it and github we use it

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,460
for all semesters so I can kind of see

00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,210
how things have changed in the learning

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,580
management system

00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,380
I've got assignment things and the

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,090
lockdown content and in the github I

00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,470
have all the public things and you're

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,150
probably thinking like well the reading

00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,330
lists could probably be public I mean

00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,280
you're right but it's easier and less

00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,500
fussy for the students to have all of

00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,360
the assignment stuff in one place they

00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,610
are in their comfort zone in the LMS all

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,290
of their assignments are listed there so

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,420
I don't want to split those up under

00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:36,720
this sort of arbitrary distinction of

00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:38,670
public versus lockdown coordination is

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,800
still hard but I rather have transparent

00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,810
coordination with timestamps then

00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,940
completely opaque coordination that's

00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,010
also still hard the various problems

00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,310
we've had with this is the solution

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,760
files got committed in once the Jupiter

00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,040
diffs

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,780
sort of at least stock out of the box

00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,870
instead of github need more shell um

00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,420
tons of PRS it's really hard to work

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,800
through because yeah we need to work in

00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,020
that kind of communication and etiquette

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,850
and inside of our own team um and I

00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,560
definitely blew away a lot of changes my

00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,890
TA made when I deleted the repository

00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,240
because I misread the timestamps but we

00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,920
had a backup for the stuff we really

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,470
needed so that worked

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,300
um setting up for a new semester the

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,000
importer for kit changed names and dates

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,740
and you're kind of done all right like

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,550
and then you can start working away at

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,710
the new content for that next semester

00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:32,340
secondary benefits for students I'd like

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,320
to go with exposure for comfort and then

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,450
dial in the novelty of actually doing

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,600
the thing I think it's really important

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,980
sort of this like I work I do stuff with

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,800
maker spaces and I think the maker space

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,210
osmosis factor like just listening to

00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,680
people talk shop for a year about

00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,960
something about 3d printing for example

00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:52,440
it's really helpful then when you want

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,990
to do your first 3d printing um so well

00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,060
they're not directly using github they

00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,260
are navigating to github to get their

00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,970
materials they're learning what the

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,850
interface looks like they're starting to

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:05,040
see the lingo in context they see me

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,590
commit and push in class and you talking

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,540
about it um the same thing for Jupiter

00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,580
they get to see the note books they've

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,890
read them they're not executing them but

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,570
they're reading them um some will

00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:18,570
actually fork it and start using the MIL

00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:20,490
fix themselves and then they will

00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,080
actually some of them will use Jupiter

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,580
with totally without any transitional

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,100
problems at the end for their final

00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,660
projects and I find that I don't have to

00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,000
like I say like oh yeah it's shift-enter

00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,950
sorry about that is like most I have to

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,660
explain and they've kind of figured out

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,840
on my own because they've seen in read

00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,400
mine for fourteen weeks um secondary

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,169
benefits from my instruction team my

00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,000
summer ta submitted her first pull

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:45,179
request in her very first week with me

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,250
cool in the five minutes um we all learn

00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,380
as we go so we can experiment and learn

00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,419
together in our comfort zones we get

00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,429
valuable practice as a team for June

00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:56,520
cordon for you getting team coordination

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:58,020
so in summary Jupiter notebooks allow

00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,970
instructors to create really flexible

00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,210
content to be taught in multiple

00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,950
contexts multiple platforms it opens up

00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,620
a really clean way to migrate your

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:10,370
course content into a repository to

00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:13,350
allow for a lot of different remix hang

00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:16,140
it sets up future runs really really

00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:18,270
well because it brings that context of

00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,680
the authorship history and so for

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,360
example like I need more context for

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,480
this example that you clearly wrote and

00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,620
committed in here last year time stamps

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,870
and other edits are really transparent

00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,880
to students and that's

00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,400
really important to me I don't want you

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,500
to feel her just heard I want you to

00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,250
feel like I take action and care about

00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,750
your feedback so my calls not calls to

00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,980
action because only you know your

00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,630
context for action

00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,270
I want these are my calls for you to

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,500
consider consider using platforms like

00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,040
doobie or notebooks to write your

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,200
lessons

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,770
despite if you are not even teaching and

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Jupiter and questions sometimes if

00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,790
Jupiter is the right platform to teach

00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,430
in for the thing that you're doing there

00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:00,530
match your notebook content style to the

00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:03,890
style of interface that you're teaching

00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:06,980
inside of migrate as many text documents

00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,540
as you can into markdown if it just has

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,840
text for me I just put it in a markdown

00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,910
document because it's easier keep your

00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,230
previous runs protected so students can

00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,510
reuse them and you can archive them

00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,980
later on as well and really do take the

00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:22,160
time to train up your instruction team

00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,020
so that everyone can learn so if you are

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,020
curious and want to see the drama show

00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:31,220
of the fall semester getting wrangled up

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:34,070
it's there this is the fourth repository

00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,270
I've run now this is my fifth Clint Run

00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,540
teaching this semester teaching this

00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:40,040
class this slide ducks do I is there and

00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:48,410
you can hit that URL to download it and

00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:50,030
that's what I've got questions and if we

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,940
can't get to your question feel free to

00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,860
ask me whatever you want afterwards I'm

00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:00,470
I can talk about this stuff all day long

00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:05,540
so bring it questions we have some time

00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:13,640
for questions did I answer all of them

00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:16,100
probably not bring it come on they don't

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,480
so if they do a final project with code

00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,040
it's the programming project they are

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,600
required to use it but I teach them how

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,750
to use github desktop yeah I have very

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,980
strong opinions about that but most of

00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,630
them they have like a little hour-long

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,640
workshop that's written in markdown and

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,810
I do in a lab session and that's totally

00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,910
enough and most of them teach it

00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,910
themselves to themselves as they go so

00:37:51,460 --> 00:38:03,290
yeah I've had a variety of feedback

00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,970
along those lines so I've had students

00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:08,180
who were concurrently in classes using

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,859
Jupiter and they really liked mine

00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,450
better as their very first exposure

00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,780
because they just sort of the cell Ness

00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:16,970
was in the than eating your own tail

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,460
sometimes was kicking them in the butt

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:21,440
um I've had students who I super

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,300
inspired to divert their entire program

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,220
to be a technical program take later

00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:30,170
technical classes and they would come to

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,700
me for help with those classes that so

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,619
one of their projects I have a lot of

00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,480
research process projects for like

00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:36,770
writing and essays one of the essays

00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,480
they have to do is investigate five

00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,820
different platforms and I des free

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,099
programming in Python and I have them

00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,619
and I do require a Jupiter for that as

00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:47,390
one of them and a lot of them do like it

00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:49,849
can go either way I've had stone

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,830
students just like know what is this

00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:53,359
cell thing I am not engaging with that

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,310
and others going like yeah that's really

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,690
cool I'm like and it's usually like no

00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,830
one's really indifferent towards it

00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:11,810
everyone's like either like this is

00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:13,760
awesome or like no so yeah so I like

00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,190
pycharm education edition because it's

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,140
quiet because even though the little

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,000
prompts that have gray in it you know or

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,160
like it's gray you're clearly not

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,970
yelling at me about anything today we

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,550
know that because we know that

00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,770
contextually and but they are like it's

00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,410
telling me about Pep eight and I don't

00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,790
understand and I can't do my homework

00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:35,210
because it's telling me I'm not doing

00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:37,369
pep eight things and I'm like it's fine

00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,869
you can be fine um I like it because

00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:41,000
it's quiet and there's the big green

00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:42,440
button and I run it and they click it

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,750
and it appears there is a problem with

00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,250
like they use if they're using input to

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,540
type in inputs and getting it and puts

00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,640
from users the cursor doesn't appear

00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,040
next to it and I have to

00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,840
walk them through that the the fact that

00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,410
it ends every successful run with

00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,620
completed with error code zero horrifies

00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,270
them and I have to take about ten

00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,850
minutes in class to say like you want

00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:08,230
this to see they see the word error and

00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:14,230
they don't read further they're just

00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:14,710
like it's fine it's fine it's gonna be

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,140
fine

00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,790
so but once they get through that they

00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,870
really like it and I do offer that I

00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,520
tell them you can use whatever you want

00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,440
this is the one you're gonna see me

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,360
using and most of them I've never had

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,950
anyone do anything else but in class

00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,200
they have their laptops open with

00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,970
PyCharm doing the thing there have been

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,890
a few I do have cloud options for

00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:36,840
everything and I work with students one

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,840
on one if they need to for other stuff

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:45,610
cool right time so thank you

00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,610
