Title: Current RISE capabilities and its evolution into the future- Damián Avila (Anaconda, Inc.)
Publication date: 2018-09-21
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	RISE has evolved into the main slideshow machinery for live presentations within the Jupyter notebook. Damián Avila explains how to install and use RISE. You’ll also discover how to customize it and see some of its new capabilities, including how to get PDFs from your slides, how to use RISE with the nbextension_configurator package, and how to use the new chalkboard capabilities. Damián concludes by discussing the migration from RISE into a new JupyterLab-RISE extension providing RISE-based capabilities in the new JupyterLab interface.

let's start with a little bit of

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:09,870
presentation my name is Damian Avila

00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:13,139
you have my Twitter handle there also

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,400
they have account if you want to see

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:21,119
some of the things I am doing and the

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,800
third line you have the URL for my block

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:29,070
I I usually write not too much lately

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,780
but I usually write some interesting

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:38,190
stuff I think at least people tell me

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,249
that okay I am senior software developer

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,499
at anaconda and an opposing source

00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:46,530
developer centered essentially in the

00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:48,870
cubicle system core contributor for

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,019
Jupiter and Jupiter thing constant

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,249
member have been involved with Jupiter

00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,249
for about six years

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:02,729
but word today the idea is to talk about

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,229
rice and some of the latest things about

00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,850
rice

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:13,700
who knows rice here okay who has use

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,979
rice in the past okay great

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,890
well we can probably go faster with this

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,829
section a second chili rice is done for

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,829
revealed Jupiter ipython slash of

00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,990
extension when we when we had the

00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:33,600
ipython notebook I know is the sugars

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,820
are not book first once upon a time the

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,969
first idea was to develop a kind of

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,079
converter for MB convert to export the

00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:45,509
your notebook into an a static HTML

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,869
slide show based on vgs and that is

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,590
essentially available in a become part

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:55,319
but the problem with that approach is

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,570
that we have an aesthetic slide show a

00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:02,020
lot of people wanted to have this

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:05,799
a kind of live slide so after some time

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:08,009
we develop rice you don't have anymore

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,590
they static a slide show you can

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:16,209
essentially execute code and make

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:19,380
anything that you can actually do and

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:24,209
show in in the notebook it's a notebook

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:27,819
branded as revealed yes slideshows but

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:33,550
in a slightly way that's the the main

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:36,970
idea and idea behind that is to have

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:42,670
that interactivity that the static

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:45,610
presentation didn't provide but

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,239
essentially what what is raisa at his

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:53,170
core essentially we use reveals yes as a

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,209
framework to create the slideshow is a

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,989
pretty popular

00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:03,150
sheis library to make presentations

00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:06,640
there are a lot a lot of more actually

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:11,769
interested as well but we chose that I

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:17,829
chose that one because of the 2d nature

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:21,910
with for me was interesting but you can

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:27,100
probably develop something similar with

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:31,390
other with other GS a slideshow machine

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:34,810
yours is essentially understand a

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:38,260
specific and specific HTML structure and

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:43,780
makes all the magic behind to to show us

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:47,340
the slideshow obviously I am presenting

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,980
this with try so this is a live demo

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:56,739
which is not recommended but that's okay

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:59,170
for this on the other side to make rice

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:03,890
war we need essentially some kind of

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:07,220
signal to give reveal yes

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:11,000
the information about how we are going

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,550
to build our our slideshow the structure

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,980
of the of the presentation we we are

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:19,090
writing and the other part is

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,920
essentially what Rice does which is

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:27,200
rearranging of the cells accordingly to

00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:29,480
that information we provide provides

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,880
something that refugees can understand

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,890
and modify on-the-fly this is something

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,930
that I mentioned before but it's

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,510
important to know that rice is just

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,790
another view of the notebook it's the

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,750
notebook itself but render is render it

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,610
up and a dollar an hour another view so

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,800
anything that works as the color re

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,770
anything that works in a notebook it

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,680
should work in rice is that is not the

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,169
case you should report that and we will

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,080
try to fix it as soon as possible

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:07,960
probably as soon as possible is not a

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:14,060
short amount of time but we will try

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:16,790
so please report any issue you have well

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,990
essentially I think this is important

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,640
because I wrote here that rice provides

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,460
a simple way to get the presentation

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:30,490
view and I think that probably the

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:33,830
popularity of rice is because is

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:38,450
targeted to some group of people that

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:41,570
want to write want to share their

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:45,680
content in their notebooks and show that

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:50,540
in a slightly way without too too much

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,150
work and I think the rice fix that that

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,140
that space well and this is why people

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:59,810
is actually using and we had the

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,970
complete they convened power of choosing

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,190
essentially all the things that we will

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,850
GS bring to the

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:11,810
to the world if you want we use in rice

00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:15,860
and all the machinery all the power of

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:21,020
the shipyard notebook of a super-loud

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,090
notebook so there you have some links

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:28,030
for the documentation and the repository

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:31,550
in case you don't know but essentially

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:37,040
that that there was a kind of intro I

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:40,900
wanted to do to you now essentially talk

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:46,220
about what are the goal for this for the

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:49,730
presentation rice started about I think

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,910
four years ago so it has evolved a lot

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:55,910
and lately in that in the last year we

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:59,780
we have several contributions for some

00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:02,620
people particularly one people that that

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:08,090
is very active right now

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:10,310
and we we now provide some new

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:14,000
capabilities that probably a lot of you

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:18,350
will find useful to make your

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,750
presentations in the future so the main

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:26,390
idea is for the people not having any

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:30,169
experience with rice as a simple comment

00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:32,570
about how to install and use rice then I

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,940
will follow with how to customize it I

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:39,770
think that is probably something that

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:42,950
people don't know too much about it is

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:47,600
interesting because you can go beyond

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:49,760
the simple slide show you can notice

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,010
here that I have a background in images

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:57,110
I have some other things there that in

00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:01,390
the in the Indian negative in the yeah

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:04,760
in the native view you you don't see

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,980
there are they are cousteau me sessions

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,010
and I will speak a little bit about that

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,770
then about how to get PDF from the

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:15,620
slideshow that is important for a lot of

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:19,729
people to share that

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,030
that content people can use and become

00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:27,070
birth and transfer and convert the the

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:30,790
networks to to the static representation

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:34,700
but a lot of people prefers PDF and

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:39,080
religious all over the years provided

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:43,969
some ways to to to have or to to output

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,550
or to produce a PDF but for a long time

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,400
that that was broken right now is

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,860
actually working pretty well but there

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,990
are new development not only in villages

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,420
but also outside we will yes to make

00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,080
that happen so I will talk about that

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,940
and then how to use a new chalkboard

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,200
capabilities that I think a lot of

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,339
people will will find useful and a

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,170
little a little surprised as well and

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,690
finally in the last minute I would like

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:18,080
to talk a little bit about the emulation

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:21,980
of the existing extension into a shoe

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,800
potala previous extension to provide

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,589
this kind of experience in in Jupiter

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,959
lab yeah so I will I will talk a little

00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:33,950
bit about about that and how is the

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:37,550
progress so far and what we need for the

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:41,029
future okay installation is pretty

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:44,330
simple with Conda convinced I'll seek on

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:47,540
the forge price I put an out there

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:51,860
because previously I was producing all

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:56,470
the packages by myself and we're located

00:09:51,860 --> 00:10:00,770
in in my channel and anaconda org but

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:04,820
since some releases ago we started to to

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:08,360
to make our our builds in Cana Forge so

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:13,400
it I recommend to go there to to to

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:15,709
download and install rice alternately

00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:20,450
you can use pip to install rice but you

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:23,720
need a second step which is essentially

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,270
installing or copying all the static

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,510
content from the package into the proper

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:33,560
place where the notebook can take that

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:39,860
content and make it available for the

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:42,710
extension the two options works well the

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:48,230
the first one is probably better because

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:51,320
it's less work usage

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:55,310
I will go very fast with this because a

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,100
lot of people know how to use price but

00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:04,760
essentially I will show I can exit here

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:08,420
I wrote my presentation here if you go

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,360
to the View menu or in the menu in the

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,100
interview drop-down folder you can see

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:21,980
they are in the cell toolbar and a

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:27,230
slideshow submenu that a specific option

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:32,830
adds a box here at the top right of

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:37,280
every cell where you can actually tell

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:41,750
rice if you want to make that sell on a

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:46,040
slide a super slide with the super slide

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:50,300
is essentially a secondary slide in in

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:53,270
the other direction of the of the linear

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:58,310
direction we have in in the presentation

00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:01,070
it is taking advantage of the 2d

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,410
arrangement of trivial GS and you have

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,760
some other things like is fragments to

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:10,130
to make some o2 highlights on some ideas

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,220
the ability to escape the cell if you

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:17,690
don't want to show that so in your

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:21,530
presentation and notes if you want to

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,740
make some notes but as probably some of

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,490
you know the speaker knows doesn't work

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:32,370
in rice

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:35,730
yet well essentially when when you set

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,930
up this thing you just press the button

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,589
and you have the slash it's pretty it's

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,860
pretty simple okay

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:50,459
gives to me sessions you can do a lot of

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:54,029
customizations you can customize the

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:56,660
team the transition between the slide

00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:58,860
shows there is it and now to launch

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,970
presentation mode which is essentially

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,730
allows you to to to start the slideshow

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:08,430
as soon as you open the notebook that is

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,860
interesting for foreign for the use case

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:15,600
in baton binder for instance you want to

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:19,170
to push some content and show unusual

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,930
the extension life you can you can put

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,300
in your in your or you can set up the

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,810
things I will eventually how but you can

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,779
set up the things to to start or to how

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:36,899
to launch the representation as soon as

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:38,940
the binder starts you can tell it'll

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,149
rise where to start the presentation if

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,279
it is in the select cell or added at the

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:46,320
top of the first cells you have

00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,170
automatic selection of cell and this is

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,870
something that going to use some some in

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,529
some recent versions because there was a

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:59,520
kind of an sync between the selection of

00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:03,209
the cells that we are writing and how

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,310
this ly show progress right now that is

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:09,079
Sol and by default we sync the two

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,540
events so when you switch to a new slide

00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:15,990
there is an auto selection for for this

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:20,220
for the first cells of that slide and

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:23,160
that is very useful you can change at

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:26,010
life sides the vertical scroll valleys

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,959
is not by default but it is available

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,950
for for people that want to put more

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:34,310
content in in their slide show or

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:39,149
in one specific slide and there is a

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:41,670
scrollable to the right you can modify

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:45,019
some of the native reveal GS settings

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:47,899
reveal GS has a lot of possibilities of

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:51,870
configurations or economical few inches

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,329
and we expose some of them in price not

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,240
all of them but some of them and you

00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:59,550
have those abide levels and then I will

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:04,829
talk essentially we will talk about

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:08,579
these three free themes at the free lat

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:10,709
point one is the decoration of the

00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,709
possibility to to change the background

00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:16,889
to add some other stuff at the heater at

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:21,560
the footer there is a one another option

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:25,620
to make more aggressive customizations

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:30,389
how to give some CCS to make your

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:37,769
presentations nicer and some ideas about

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:40,470
the cable keyboard shortcuts but before

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:44,430
entering into that it's important to to

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:49,970
tell you I think where you can set up

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:53,690
all these con three options and we have

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:59,490
different weights to set up that

00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:03,380
configuration one of these ways is using

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:07,320
some config files that are

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,450
essentially written written as JSON in

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,750
this case I use a little bit of Python

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:19,220
to write a JSON file which is something

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:21,900
that the notebook understand and then

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,800
can pass the information that we want to

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,960
to use for our presentation that is

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,740
probably something that not a lot of

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:36,900
people like to play with because there

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:39,870
is some some details so there is another

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:44,490
a tool called and the extension coffee

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:49,680
from configurator which is essentially a

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:52,320
kind of UI that allows you to change to

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,720
enable and disable extensions and to

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,340
change some of the options of the

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,830
options this is provided but the ipython

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,829
country repo which is a report

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,560
containing a lot of extensions and since

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:11,939
they have a lot of attention they need

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:15,839
some UI way to to help people to enable

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,839
those extensions if you you can install

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:23,189
the B extension configurator it some

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,819
releases ago we did the changes to

00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,819
support that

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,070
you can install it with Conda

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:33,650
alternatively with with pip it's pretty

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,710
simple and after instantly you will see

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:39,230
here a new a new tab called and the

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:42,590
extension there you will see a lot of

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,240
attention if you have installed cells in

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,500
session before but in this case I am

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,510
showing rice and here you can select you

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,350
have the until auto lunch option here

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:57,380
the started slide showed in the selected

00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:02,000
position you have all the options that

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:05,120
are available right now and an easy way

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,480
to customize it that is interesting for

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:14,470
people that don't want to play with the

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,720
plane Jason on config files but

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,270
additionally we have another layer of

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,930
configuration if you want because this

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:28,580
MV configurator and all the JSON

00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:30,890
configure stuff will modify all your

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,410
presentations but maybe you can you can

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,540
make any specific change in one of the

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:40,010
presentations so in the notebook

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:45,680
metadata you can essentially define

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:48,020
there a key rice and you can essentially

00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,440
put there all the options you want so

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,120
that is specific the notebook will use

00:18:51,440 --> 00:19:00,310
those options

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:03,040
after high case I guess he hurt and that

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:09,340
is something useful if you want to have

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:11,530
some some specific customizations it's

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,280
pretty easy to to go to the I don't know

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:16,900
if you want how to access the edit the

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,390
notebook metadata but essentially in the

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,410
Edit menu you will find an edit notebook

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:30,930
metadata I you if at they are a kind of

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:35,560
JSON thing that you can modify faster

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:37,060
how we can decorate our slides and I

00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,980
think this is important because a lot of

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:44,590
people like the simplicity to have a

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,890
slice shot view without doing too much

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:50,740
work essentially just signaling

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:54,250
signaling which says you want assess

00:19:50,740 --> 00:20:00,130
slides and you are done but a lot of

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:05,680
people ask me about some ways to modify

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:08,260
the extension to to catch up and to add

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,660
some common things like backgrounds

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:16,300
heaters if you want to put your company

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:21,340
their food that kind of stuff so we we

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:27,010
provide that as well in in recent

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:30,910
release you can define the you have you

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:34,300
can put that as options like the ones I

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,520
described before essentially under the

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,120
right thing or in your config files or

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:44,330
in the MV configurator expansion

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,850
you can put their a back image and a

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,090
footer and heater which is essentially

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,760
what I did in this presentation you can

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:56,150
be both more imaginative than me

00:20:52,760 --> 00:21:00,830
probably and made a lot of interesting

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:04,850
things with with this in this case I

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:08,060
just use a powered by Jupiter background

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:11,810
images and my Twitter handle a little

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,810
bit more and no more than that but along

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:18,260
with this we provide some way to add the

00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:21,890
accused on CCS you can put in your

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:25,520
directory or ICS file containing all

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:28,370
your routes and that will affect all the

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,630
notebooks in your directory but you can

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:36,220
also add in a specific CCS which is the

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:40,010
not good name that CCS that will

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,780
essentially affect that specific

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:45,860
notebook and not others

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:50,930
so in this case I have this file this

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:53,900
sugar cone 18 CCS which is essentially

00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:57,260
doing some stuff over the header the

00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:00,440
footer and the back image so with the

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:04,490
HTML and the CCS you can probably do a

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,500
lot of nice things and I think that is

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,470
that that is probably useful for a lot

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,720
of people that want to make that want to

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:19,220
make the representation more richer be

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:20,930
visually speaking okay one more thing

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,750
should be the reactions reaches

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:28,160
registered by rice or Q some keyboard

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:32,180
shortcuts Jupiter provides some

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,880
machinery I am talking about the legacy

00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,910
notebook right now in Jupiter love there

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,960
is also something close to do this but

00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:44,450
that's another another topic and shook

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,330
the tribunal books the traditional

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,600
analog provide some some ways to give

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:53,280
some eyes

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:56,580
your keyboard shortcuts and you can you

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,310
can actually modify those things from

00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:04,590
rice itself and we are currently using

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:08,490
that machinery so you you can actually

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:11,610
have some some cubic custom keyboard

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:15,630
shortcuts for rice to enter or exit the

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:17,930
slideshow to toggle the slide or service

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:22,650
lag of fragments so you don't need to go

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:24,950
anymore to this thing's all toolbar and

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,230
modify the thing there you can just use

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:31,080
the keyboard event to make the change

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,660
and that that is pretty useful

00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,870
there are some other things that we

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:42,830
registered there but they are not define

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:46,380
it but you can define it as you want but

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,920
how you can modify this essentially you

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:55,320
can do it by shades on you can modify

00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:58,680
the de novo metadata that that is one

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,440
way you can add a custom yes that

00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:04,290
Jupiter look understand and I'd let you

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,880
modify but probably the most simple

00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:11,400
thing is go into the sugar main string

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,740
keyboard shortcut editor that is

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,080
something like this if you want to help

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,580
and a rich keyboard shortcut you will

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,880
see all the key worship codes as the

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:25,170
notebook is defining right now and if

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,390
you go to the latest rows you will see

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,330
there the toggle slide the troubles will

00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:35,460
slide a slideshow and you can change

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:39,149
their and/or another shortcut

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:42,000
that maybe is better for you so I think

00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:46,010
that this you I thank you I think this

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,210
you i way to change the some of the

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,250
shortcuts for rice are pretty

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,549
interesting are probably useful for for

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,549
people

00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,779
PDF exportation we have tomatoes

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:03,720
tomatoes right now to make the to make a

00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:07,200
PDF for from our presentation one is

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,210
using the cut the cows in the ND compact

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,730
essentially you use and be compared to

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:18,059
compared your your your I p.m. be file

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:23,340
to anesthetic slideshow and then you can

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:28,950
essentially you can add a print PDF to

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:32,460
the URL that will add some specifics CCS

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:36,210
that reveal is injecting so you can

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:40,559
actually print the PDF from Chrome or

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:44,700
your navigate your browser using the

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:48,240
they command options this is working

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:51,600
pretty well but it will show you the

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:56,159
slideshow as the static representation

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,429
you have is not exactly the same view of

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,880
the price because they there are some

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:07,140
tiny difference the other method that is

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,909
very interesting is using one library

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,590
called egg shape dick tip actually

00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:16,340
supports the conversion of HTML

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,950
slideshows into periods for multiples

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:22,679
Shia's libraries reveals what is one of

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:27,820
them and rice is one of them as well the

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:32,110
outer road plug-in to make

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:34,570
and to make easy to to clear PDF from

00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,810
rice presentations so you can install it

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:41,470
with NPM we can talk later how to do

00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:43,300
that it's not complex you have to make

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,810
sure that the out to lunch option is

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:49,390
disabled for now right now the master

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,580
this guy has has a fix for that but in

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:55,540
the release version if you have the auto

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:58,870
lunch option enable when the plugins

00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,870
runs we try to push the button and we'll

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:06,820
exit from the slideshow view so you have

00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:09,820
you have a good PDF but that will fix in

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,490
the next deck deck type for now you only

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:15,460
need to disable auto lunch and

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:19,060
essentially you you pass the rice

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:23,170
plug-in here and you tell the notebook

00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:27,670
URL one thing I didn't mention you need

00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:31,810
to start a notebook server but you don't

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:34,990
even need to open the slideshow you only

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:39,130
need to start the server you pass the

00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:41,430
Jupiter notebook URL and I put five more

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:46,480
completely it looks something like this

00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:53,050
be sure to put your token here and here

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:58,120
I think because otherwise it will not

00:27:53,050 --> 00:28:01,180
work I can explain it we have time why

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,010
not but be sure to put they talk in the

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,620
token you can get the token when you

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:09,150
study a good server that is informed and

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:13,240
you you have another ways to to get it

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:16,420
and this will output a very good very

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:20,590
very good PDF from from rice is

00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:24,190
essentially taking off some of the of

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:27,460
the buttons you see there and the

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:32,980
quality is pretty amazing as far as I I

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:35,620
I see I saw okay

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:40,510
Chuck balls capabilities and this is

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:43,899
something new I think this is important

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:46,990
from the educational perspective because

00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:49,090
a lot of people probably on top of the

00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,429
slide show may want to make annotations

00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,730
or something like that so you will

00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:58,299
notice here at the left and at the

00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:02,610
bottom there are new icons if you touch

00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:07,090
in the second one you have essentially

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:15,010
chipboard where you can do unexplained

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:19,149
themes I think this is useful but I

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:21,669
think is more useful the other the other

00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:24,639
icon if you press that you can do

00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:28,750
annotations here and those annotations

00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:32,740
could be essentially downloaded as JSON

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:36,159
files we are using a plug-in called

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,289
reveals yes a Cherbourg and they are

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,330
doing all the Michigan we are

00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:42,340
integrating that in provides I think

00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:47,850
this is pretty pretty interesting for

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:52,049
for people probably very useful okay

00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:58,419
this surprise is a speaker not is

00:29:52,049 --> 00:30:01,659
working right now yeah it's it's a first

00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:04,419
iteration but the things are working at

00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:09,090
less you have here the demonstration

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:12,130
show the next slide show and the note

00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,899
about people about the the notes level

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:19,299
cells that is something that mentioned

00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:22,059
before we can probably we will probably

00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:28,809
give tonight these to make it better

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:34,179
because maybe the top right thing needs

00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:36,640
to be zoom in or zoom out to be to

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:39,909
actually see all the slideshow and all

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:44,620
and not a part of it so probably these

00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:45,309
will get some other iterations but right

00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,279
now it is working

00:30:45,309 --> 00:31:00,309
and it's 32 okay I am yeah

00:30:51,279 --> 00:31:01,630
I'm pretty close I think okay here this

00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:03,820
is something I want to mention but

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,730
because I think is important from the

00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:10,870
usability perspective they not book a

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:15,940
five point six add a prom rambutan you

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:22,210
can see it here if you press this you

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:24,700
can run that cell people found annoying

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:28,389
this but button and in master is

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:31,840
currently removed but in the rice use

00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:35,320
case I think is pretty nice and in makes

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,139
sense so I will make sure that in the

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,899
next release when the notebook the next

00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:43,570
version of the notebook is released we

00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:46,450
will release a version of rice that will

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:49,059
add that button again because right now

00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,010
is essentially hidden in the in the

00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:53,320
master branch is essentially hidden you

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,690
can see it in

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,890
if you if you see the notebook in

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:04,060
yourself or in or in a tablet about me

00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:07,210
or using many average CCS kind of things

00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:09,610
so we can use that CCS and make it

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:12,840
available in rice and I think that is

00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:16,780
important and I'm probably very useful

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:22,060
because you can use your laptop and run

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:25,510
things there okay I want to mention that

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:30,030
because some people open an issue in

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:35,380
rice about the availability of this

00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:39,550
button and hiding in the next version

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:46,140
zone so the idea was shared knowledge

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:48,910
about that so we can we can use it okay

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,590
that is the important thing probably one

00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:55,360
of the important thing the new release

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:57,070
is out is rice Phi for one it contains

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,730
the child work the Cherbourg

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:04,390
capabilities and the speaker speaker

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:07,930
notes remember that this our first

00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:11,770
iteration on data so I encourage you to

00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:15,190
try to to to open issues because they

00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:17,470
will be issues about that Allah that

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:23,200
that will allow allows us to shape the

00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:26,950
theme better in next next versions and

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:30,910
there is that is important there is no

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:34,290
way v falls co because it was broken but

00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:38,050
there is no need to tell anyone about

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:39,490
something I want to talk a little bit is

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,820
about the ship that love integration

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:48,130
essentially and currently I have a PLC

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:49,780
living in this pull request and and I

00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:53,890
can show you a little bit about that

00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:59,890
this is should be the love you can see

00:33:53,890 --> 00:34:03,870
here a button if you go there you have

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:07,240
you have the rice as peers but this is

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:09,340
this needs a lot of work because it's

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,610
only recognized for instance is only

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:15,940
recognized the slide cells but not the

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:18,340
other cells so in its some work to make

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:22,510
its own to make it something that we

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:25,600
could actually release so but this is

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:28,870
working it's working it's working

00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,590
nice I think and and one of the things I

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:35,500
think is important about that is that

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:38,800
having rice in in sugar lab alo allows

00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:43,419
us to to explore other spaces if you

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:49,080
open a new view of the notebook here let

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:51,580
me show you something like this maybe

00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:56,160
the interesting thing is that you can

00:34:51,580 --> 00:35:03,550
probably change this too high

00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:07,030
let me see print hi oops and I will

00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:10,650
change that live in in the slide shows

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:12,790
in rice because those two documents are

00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,640
understanding the oh I connected to the

00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:18,370
same model so eventually we can come up

00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,600
with something that will allows us to

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:24,940
design the slide show in a more

00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,280
interactive way I think that that is a

00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:31,660
lot of potential for people that want to

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,930
make their presentation more complex and

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,690
I think that that opens a lot of a lot

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:41,020
of a space to to explore so we need to

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:44,950
put more work on and make rice finally

00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:49,810
happen on Jupiter lab but we we are on

00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:56,859
rope okay I don't have too much time

00:35:49,810 --> 00:36:00,849
about this so essentially help is

00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:02,859
I encourage you to try to help us if you

00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:05,769
know about soup the love extensions that

00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:08,829
will help us if you want to contribute

00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:11,140
to this quadrant Jupiter lab to a

00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:13,599
current a rice extension that will be

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,999
helpful as well because if other people

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,319
works on that I can't work on the on the

00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:24,690
Jupiter last extension so any help not

00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:28,630
only write writing code documentation

00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:32,440
ideas and issues that you have that is

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,549
very welcome discussion I already talked

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,519
about this

00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:38,999
I want to thank all the rice users and

00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:43,089
contributors and the sugar community

00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:45,819
anaconda that support support me to to

00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:49,329
be here and Daniel and Facundo my

00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:51,430
partner my eye my son okay we have

00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:54,850
probably questions or time for some

00:36:51,430 --> 00:37:01,500
questions okay right thank you

00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:04,500
[Applause]

00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,500
yeah

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,390
okay

00:37:23,029 --> 00:37:26,029
yeah

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,370
well we have to question essentially the

00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,570
first one is the different between the

00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:41,800
print PDF option and the deck type

00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:44,860
option the dictate option is is pretty

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,050
good and better than the the print PDF

00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:51,760
the print PDF is essentially applying

00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:54,700
CCS over your slide show your static

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,940
slide showed that you got with any

00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:04,930
convert and you print that with with

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:09,100
with a common browser instead duct tape

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:12,430
as long as I know it is using it is

00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:16,120
render indexed every slide using a

00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:19,660
Chrome driver below and take in

00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:22,860
I don't know side picture taking taking

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:27,280
information about every slide I'm

00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:31,810
building your PDF we with that the

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,840
quality of the of the PDF generated bug

00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:39,540
detected is is far better than dandy

00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:43,300
Allah in my experience about the widget

00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,940
we actually support which as far as I

00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,040
know if something is not working you

00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,950
should open an issue about that that it

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:54,220
should work in fact some other

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:57,820
conference I have shown some some some

00:38:54,220 --> 00:39:02,500
some widgets but it should work if it

00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:04,840
doesn't work you should report more

00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,840
questions

00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,840
yeah

00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,280
Godley

00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:30,880
yeah yeah

00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,880
yeah

00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:36,880
people who it really would really find

00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:40,089
out things

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,180
because otherwise we need to go to all

00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:46,660
the other population beings and that is

00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:50,640
not a proper UI trolley and itself is a

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,640
better UI powerful for the user

00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,080
mm-hmm

00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:21,390
okay no questions yeah yes we will she s

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:24,060
by the not by default but it it provides

00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:27,930
some options to make the thing automate

00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:30,330
to make the slideshow run automated and

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:34,680
you can customize that I don't think

00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:37,589
that we exposed that from rice but it

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,410
should be pretty trivial so it's just

00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:42,450
probably adding one line of code so if

00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,970
it doesn't work for you

00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:47,640
or open an issue about that and we will

00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:50,970
provide that I think that is important

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,190
and useful because we don't surface all

00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:56,040
the reveal options we call there are

00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,800
multiple options we only surface what we

00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,310
think people use so see if some people

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:06,780
use that data option we need to to

00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:10,730
provide it yeah okay

00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,730
no more time okay thank you

00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,210
