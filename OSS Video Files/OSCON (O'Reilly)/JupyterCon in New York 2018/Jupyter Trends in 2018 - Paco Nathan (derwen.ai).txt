Title: Jupyter Trends in 2018 - Paco Nathan (derwen.ai)
Publication date: 2018-08-23
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	Jupyter is built on a set of extensible, reusable building blocks, expressed through various open protocols, APIs, and standards. For many use cases, these are combined to provide extensible software architecture for interactive computing with data. Paco Nathan shares a few somewhat unexpected things that emerged in 2018.

thank you very much I'm grateful to be

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,600
here at Jupiter con really looking

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,269
forward to the conference I'd like to

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,759
talk about some themes that we have been

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,290
tracking about Jupiter we've been

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,710
tracking this through O'Reilly Media a

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,060
lot of this is with respect to

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,220
enterprise use cases that we're

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,890
investigating and much what will be

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,080
represented in the Business Summit

00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,480
throughout today and tomorrow so three

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,330
themes one is that we've seen large

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,640
organizations adopting Jupiter for

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,469
shared analytics infrastructure now

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,350
there's a kind of leapfrog effect that's

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,480
involved here that we're seeing because

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,040
typically these types of enterprise

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,379
organizations would have been using

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,600
commercial offerings for analytics

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,969
infrastructure instead they've been

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,940
adopting Jupiter at scale open source

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,890
and ultimately there's there's a kind of

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,289
staffing priority I think that it drives

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,670
some of this on the one hand you in a

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,280
larger organization you've got a lot of

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,829
people who are well trained in the

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,809
problem they may not have a lot of the

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,000
technical background but they have the

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,710
domain expertise and what we're finding

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
is that they can leverage Jupiter to

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,850
gain enough of the tech enough the

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,830
tooling to really amplify what they're

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,140
doing in the domain this is often

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,400
referred to as citizen data science and

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,770
we're gonna see a lot of examples of

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,110
that the other thing is about new hires

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,180
fresh out so people are coming out of

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,130
universities now with a lot of hands-on

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,140
with Jupiter because of coursework and

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,939
then they can go into the workplace and

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,400
apply that and build say machine

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,220
learning apps on day one that have ROI

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,579
so in business as a manager why on earth

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,470
would you derail them and retrain them

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,780
to use some commercial framework that

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,820
doesn't quite have that ROI so issues

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,840
like this we'll be exploring from the

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,110
people who are making these changes

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,079
happen at the Business Summit number two

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,759
over the past couple of decades we've

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,310
had this operating assumption in

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,140
software engineering that process is

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,299
something very general at a very high

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,600
layer and it's applicable to a wide

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,820
range of applications and then well

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,429
agile of course is example there and

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,229
then there's their software which is

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,260
still relatively general there's layers

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,800
of abstraction and then there's hardware

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,020
it's much

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,030
more specific it's really down there

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,100
hardly anybody needs to really touch the

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,140
hardware directly the software abstracts

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,730
it away and besides it doesn't really

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,180
change much it just gets faster

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,010
year-over-year well that all inverted

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,900
and so if you haven't gotten the memo

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,370
about this some of the best people in

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,890
software engineering are grappling now

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,260
with what we see is sort of a temporal

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,240
regime of chaos we're nicely sure where

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,620
this is going but we know that hardware

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,100
is moving faster than the software

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,110
software is moving faster than process

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,950
Jupiter is being used as a way for teams

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,410
to future-proof

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,080
because teams can articulate units of

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,810
work in Jupiter or workflow in Jupiter

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,450
and yet still have efficient access to

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,280
customize hardware this fits especially

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,980
well with cloud services we see this a

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,860
lot in cases of say deep learning and

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,800
GPUs and the club right is a picking it

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,730
up I like to show resources from

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,980
O'Reilly

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,770
so everyone here of course gets the

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,620
complimentary 90-day subscription to

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,660
Safari another resource is called The

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,420
O'Reilly data show hosted by my

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,310
colleague Ben lorica and here's a recent

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,680
interview with Andrew Feldman from

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,510
Cerebus talking about this kind of

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,440
proliferation of customized hardware

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,959
you know we're seeing multi-core GPUs TP

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,900
use IP use DWP use FPGAs

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,570
and a wide range of Asics being used now

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,430
for machine learning for edge computing

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,110
for decentralization that whole land

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,450
shape has gifted shifted and it's

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,209
changing software engineering alright

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,270
number three as large organizations

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,650
adopt Jupiter one of the first things

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,090
that emerges one of the first things the

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,739
organizations run into are the

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,080
organizational challenges privacy ethics

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,700
security compliance these are the kind

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,459
of things that we want to have in the

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,290
dialog now and these are also things

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,950
that Silicon Valley didn't pay enough

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,540
attention to until recently so Jupiter

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,280
helps to address a lot of these needs

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,230
we'll be exploring that again in the

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,370
business summit a lot of what's

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,530
happening what's really interesting is

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,770
when within the highly regulated

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,690
environments finance defense healthcare

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,610
again where you want to have that kind

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,250
of critical dialogue going on

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,500
that's also where there's a lot of rapid

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,189
evolution of open source and that part

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,909
was unexpected speaking of which as far

00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,129
as resources

00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:41,430
o'reilly has a free mini book you can

00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,979
download Ben Lorca and I did a study

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,710
about AI adoption in enterprise

00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:49,080
worldwide and we received over eight

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,879
thousand respondents there's some very

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,310
surprising insights that came out of it

00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,150
in aggregate number one the the

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,710
sophistication of provisions for privacy

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,020
and ethics in the machine learning

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,969
workflows it's a lot more advanced than

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,159
we had imagined it was it's out in the

00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,110
field and number two also software

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:09,229
engineering processes changing it's not

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,849
business as usual it's not going to be

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,819
agile for AI for instance it's gonna be

00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:17,430
something else okay and even larger

00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,620
challenge looms we're three decades past

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,659
when Tim berners-lee introduced world

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,729
wide web more than five decades since

00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:25,919
Ted Nelson introduced hypertext more

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:28,110
than seven decades since Vannevar Bush

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,289
and Bohr Hayes had first articulated

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,599
about hypertext online media has had

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,569
this expanse at the same time print

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,500
media has all but collapsed and

00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,599
unfortunately science in many ways

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,539
because of publish or perish science has

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,589
been coupled tightly with print media so

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,199
there have been a couple of interesting

00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,509
articles over the past year that talked

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,909
about actually Jupiter in a very

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,740
favorable light but criticisms of

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,839
science and the publisher perish thing

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,629
as a scattered library of digital paper

00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,389
all neatly indexed by keyword search and

00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:02,789
Wikipedia entries except when they're

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,529
not if you haven't seen this yet I

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,810
highly recommend it's an article from a

00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,969
couple weeks ago in Wired magazine it's

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,569
about a company called primer and they

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:15,509
have a new kind of AI software called

00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:17,939
Quicksilver this is a project led by the

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,129
infamous scientists journalist John

00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,719
Bohannon a good friend and also Amy

00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,599
Heinicke shangri-la and a lot of the

00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:28,520
folks at primer what Quicksilver has

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:31,710
done is to detect identify and correct

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,909
gender imbalance in Wikipedia doing

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,149
natural language understanding natural

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:38,990
language generation very advanced and it

00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,610
does show a lot of bias

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,320
under representation of women in science

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,510
in digital paper okay so the pioneers of

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,040
online media they had dreamt of new ways

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,680
for us to expand our shared

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,230
understanding science etc they had not

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,010
dreamt however about trolling or Russian

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,360
BOTS or Hospital ransomware or climate

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,570
science under attack because of

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,300
allegations of non reproducible science

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,310
we're here talking about open source

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,940
those things are exploits against a

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,560
broader context open society now Karl

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,050
Popper is very interesting he was

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,970
contemporary with Vannevar Bush and he

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,340
warned about precisely that he warned

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,430
about the urgency of reproducibility in

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,140
science and the linkage from that into

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,000
social discourse and the linkage in to

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,450
governance that if they aren't handled

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
properly

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,870
they lead very quickly to

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,190
totalitarianism we were knowing this

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,560
seeing this at the end of World War two

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,180
if you haven't read that second book

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,820
there I highly recommend the open

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,380
society and its enemies if you if you

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,260
haven't read it stop what you're doing

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,550
go find a copy read it reread it grab a

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,280
bunch of your friends talk about it in

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,960
detail I believe that in 2018 there are

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,000
surprisingly few other things that are

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,810
as salient as this other than

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,510
climatology and also as far as resources

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,280
on O'Reilly and astrophysics here's a

00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,900
great one from Steve Kramer the

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,780
mathematics of studying how galaxies

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,460
collide being applied to study cyber

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,340
threat in social media for instance

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,800
Russian blots on Twitter there already

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,930
are eight decades after World War two we

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,820
have inherited now a blend of the

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,030
optimism from Vannevar Bush about

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,090
hypertext and the cautionary tales from

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,070
Karl Popper about reproducibility and it

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,730
has to do with how unmitigated power

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,230
craves Universal statements now this is

00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,780
really important in scientific research

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,510
it's also important in other fields that

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,040
are vital for open society data science

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,720
etc software engineering teaching

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,480
journalism will be covering a lot of

00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,840
this at the conference here our question

00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,690
is what else I want to thank a friend

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,940
Tony fast is out here he'll be speaking

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,260
at the conference later he introduced me

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,720
to the notion that reproducible science

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,190
and open source really have a lot to

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,870
learn from each other

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,850
and much of what we're doing here at

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,589
Jupiter con is to bring these different

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,319
disciplines together under one roof and

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,509
then discover what is it that they must

00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:03,649
learn from each other so with that I

00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,550
really look forward the rest of

00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:06,950
conference I want to meet a lot of

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,869
people I wish you all the best thank you

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,869
[Applause]

00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,589
