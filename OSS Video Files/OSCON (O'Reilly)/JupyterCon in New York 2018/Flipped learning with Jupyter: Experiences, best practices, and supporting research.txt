	Flipped learning with Jupyter: Experiences, best practices, and supporting research
Lorena Barba (George Washington University), Robert Talbert (Grand Valley State University)

Jupyter has exploded in popularity, in not only data science but also education. As seen in the Gallery of Interesting Jupyter Notebooks, myriad notebooks are shared with the purpose of teaching some topic or technique. Used within a formal course, Jupyter combined with a pedagogical practice called “flipped learning” can lead to engaging and highly effective learning experiences.

In flipped learning, students encounter new course material before class meetings through structured activities, rather than during class via passive lecturing. This helps students learn how to learn on their own, and it frees up class time to focus on creative applications of the basic material. Typically, students in flipped learning environments encounter new material by watching lectures that are recorded and posted online. However, recent research has suggested that a more effective practice is to have students interact with a “tangible interface” that gives them hands-on experience with those new concepts.

Lorena Barba and Robert Talbert offer an overview of flipped learning and the research that supports its effectiveness, discuss the use of Jupyter notebooks as a “tangible interface” for new material in a flipped course, and share case studies from their own courses in which Jupyter was used to build an active, engaging, and academically effective flipped learning environment. Along the way, they detail design principles that leverage the best features of Jupyter to produce a high-functioning active learning environment and explore the role of Jupyter-based course materials in the rapidly expanding world of open

	00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,970
my name is Robert Albert I'm a professor

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:11,220
I just got promoted to full professor so

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,140
I just wanted it does actually happen

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,580
I'm in the mathematics department at

00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,070
Grand Valley State University in

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,210
Allendale Michigan and we want to talk

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,960
with you this morning about flipped

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,580
learning with Jupiter we're gonna just

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,170
break this into four parts you want to

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,420
leave plenty of time cube for Q&A at the

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,160
end we're gonna I'm gonna first start

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,660
off by just explaining what flipped

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,189
learning is how many of you have heard

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,629
of the flipped classroom or flipped

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,069
learning okay great

00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:36,329
there's a lot of misconceptions about

00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,620
this term though and so we're gonna

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,359
spend some time just getting on the same

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,949
page and if you know any we're gonna say

00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,780
some things about flipped learning that

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:45,749
things happen in three stages pre class

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,889
in class post class and we're going to

00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:52,019
talk about how Jupiter can and is used

00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:54,059
to great effect it helps you just learn

00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:56,460
in all phases of the game in a flipped

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,469
learning environment so let's talk first

00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,999
about flipped learning in general so

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,859
what is flipped learning well to

00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:03,839
understand flipped learning I really

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,030
believe you have to first look at the

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:07,740
traditional model of instruction okay

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,320
the traditional model of instruction is

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,880
what we have experienced if you went to

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,740
high school you went to college anywhere

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,420
in the world you have experience the

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,719
traditional model of instruction how

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,090
does it work well there's two stages to

00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,259
how students learn or are supposed to

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,210
learn in the traditional model of

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,250
instruction the first stage is you're

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,649
looking at it then students arrive in a

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,270
classroom the assumption is that they

00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:32,490
know nothing about the material they're

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,840
about to learn now that's never a true

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,549
assumption but it is an assumption

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,210
that's made students get their first

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,710
contact with new concepts by coming to a

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,409
group setting a classroom lecture

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,170
hearing someone this person talked about

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,729
this new concept and maybe transcribing

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,499
some notes and if you're lucky you get

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,729
some good examples and get some analysis

00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:53,520
you get a little bit of a taste of

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,289
what's to come that's stage one stage

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,569
two is what happens when the class is

00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,799
over okay if students exit the classroom

00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,530
they go back to their dorm rooms or

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,630
apartments to wherever and they then

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,759
start to tackle the harder parts of

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,100
material the higher level cognitive

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,500
tasks the more difficult stuff by

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,930
themselves through homework through lab

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,340
work through writing coding that sort of

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,790
thing okay this is where they encounter

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,799
the now

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,819
the application will do the creative

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,459
element of what they're trying to learn

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,689
okay the traditional model is

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,189
traditional okay we've had the

00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,599
traditional model with us for just about

00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,090
a thousand years in higher education

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,430
since 1088 when the first University was

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,909
founded okay it doesn't look that much

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,590
different than 400 years ago okay we

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,299
have all sort of survived the

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,280
traditional model okay if we're sitting

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,930
here we're in either we made it through

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,640
some portion of the traditional model

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,680
however scarred or phase or unfazed we

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,269
may be okay so you might be thinking hey

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,129
we we've done a lot with the traditional

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,840
model of Education so what's it's all

00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:52,170
good right

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,690
not necessarily okay so there's some

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,269
emergent issues that in this day and age

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,620
with the research we have from education

00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,909
and the technology that we have for

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,799
learning we're beginning to see some

00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,569
emerging issues with the traditional

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,810
model of Education that are gaining the

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,250
urgency day after day after day and to

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,319
kind of put this in perspective for you

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,250
I want you to take a look at this 2d

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,420
axis up here now every learning

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,250
experience that we have whether it's in

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,069
school or out of school to center

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,349
regular lives I say it can be plotted on

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,579
this 2d axis I am a mathematician so I

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,790
do get to bring it a little bit of this

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,169
stuff can be plotted on this 2d axis

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,910
using a couple of sets of coordinates

00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,160
one set of coordinates that I have on

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,590
the x-axis here has to do with whether

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,410
the extent to which that activity is

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,209
done individually or in a group okay

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,530
when you're working on your homework

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,959
when you're in college it's usually

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,120
pretty far along the other end towards

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,859
the individual end of the spectrum might

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,510
work in a small group that's often done

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,160
individually what we're doing right here

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,199
is on way over on the other end of the

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,819
spectrum on the group a full group side

00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,949
a lot of things are in between okay

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,659
every learning activity you experience

00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,699
can be placed somewhere along that axis

00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,680
it can also be placed somewhere along

00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,269
this vertical axis as well that

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,180
describes the extent to which the

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,680
activity is passive or active now it

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,470
seems sounds a little strange to talk

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,569
about an active activity or a passive

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,489
activity I can there possibly be such a

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,620
thing well we're all doing things but

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,470
what I mean by activity is the extent to

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,900
which you as a learner are constructing

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,370
your own understanding of the thing

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,830
you're trying to learn that's what I

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,410
mean by activity okay because we can be

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,390
active I can sit in a lecture and

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,130
scribe the day lights of the notes the

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,900
professor is giving me but in some sense

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,360
that's not really active in some sense

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,070
that's very very passive in fact okay

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,660
some of these learning activities we

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,400
experience are very very active when

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,310
you're solving a new problem by coding

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,720
or a lab activity you're really digging

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,100
in you're experiencing feel you're

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,940
recovering from it you're learning the

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,820
ins and outs

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,860
that's activity okay what we're doing

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,120
right now could be you might be thinking

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,310
really hard about what I'm saying right

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,710
now I hope at some point during the next

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,060
thirty minutes you will that's that's

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,980
activity too but maybe on a little bit

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,660
lesser scale every activity you do can

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,820
be put somewhere along that axis as well

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,710
I'm not going to have you do this but I

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,450
often ask people in an audience like

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,180
this to say take a post-it note and

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,950
write down the best most memorable most

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,160
awesome learning experience you've ever

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,530
had in school out of school write it

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,350
down now walk up to the screen and stick

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,660
it where you think it goes okay don't do

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,400
that right now I can't stop you if you

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,400
do I guess but I mean just imagine where

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,500
it would go now snap your mind back to

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,600
the traditional model of instruction

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,130
okay where does stuff go in the

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,690
traditional model well in the first

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,910
stage of learning in the traditional

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,940
model it goes here students come to

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,700
class okay you get basic you get your

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,760
first contact with basic ideas through

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,500
transcription basically by listening now

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,440
listening is good transcribing is good

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,820
we need to be able to listen okay but

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,930
most of the activity that happens in

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,230
that first step is down there in the

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,169
fourth quadrant its group passive okay

00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:03,150
the joke is of course that that in a

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,800
lecture the information flows from the

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,150
notes of the professor to the notes of

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,660
the students without passing through the

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,430
brains of either one of them and far too

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,169
often that's really the case I mean in a

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,540
great lecture that's not the case but

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,970
most people don't give great lectures

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,710
ever and I include myself in that I

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,090
would not stake my reputation or my

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,430
career on the ability to give great

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,340
lectures the second stage of this

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,260
happens well we don't really know where

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,880
it happens okay that's the thing if

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,460
you're an instructor you give students

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,020
homework to do you assume that they're

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,030
gonna take it home and do it I mean you

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,410
hope they do but are they active when

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,860
they do it or they passive when they do

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,110
it are they in a group are they not

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,820
we have no idea because when students

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,650
are getting to that upper stages of

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,670
cognitive activity they're completely

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,740
out of our sight out of our range okay

00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,480
so a couple of issues in the traditional

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,640
model first of all it tends toward

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,890
passivity okay it doesn't have to be

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,930
fully passive but that's the default it

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,480
takes a really good instructor in the

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,730
traditional model to make it not passive

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,500
in any sense and the second part is

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,240
students are hitting the hardest

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,000
material the most complicated test is

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,820
really critical tasks as they as they

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,960
learn something when they are at least

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,850
plugged into the help they need for it

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,830
how many of you have experienced this I

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,470
certainly have but my students and

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,240
myself you here's here so here's a

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,190
phrase that I get constantly in my math

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,660
courses for my students it made sense

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,800
when I was watching you do it on the

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,760
board but fill in the blank then I took

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,450
it home and I didn't know what the hell

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,210
was going on

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,550
or even what class I was in okay now why

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,890
is that it's because they're not they

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,070
think you think you get the illusion of

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,200
competence when you transcribe it's a

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:48,010
very comfortable feeling but it's false

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,110
it's bad information so in some ways the

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,270
traditional model is completely the

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,520
opposite of what we now know help

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,280
students learn the most and by know what

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,420
I mean as centuries of practice and also

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,860
many years probably 20 plus years of

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,150
solid scientific educational research

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,860
about active learning which are going to

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,960
bring up a couple of highlights in the

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,490
middle of the talk okay it would really

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,590
be better given what we know now about

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,200
how people learn about how the brain

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:18,010
works about how groups work if we just

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,350
completely flipped this model okay and

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,150
instead we had students discovering

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,100
basic concepts and getting that first

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,950
contact with new ideas

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,390
outside or prior to the classroom not by

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,010
just handing students a book and say

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,600
read chapter two and come ready to talk

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,820
about it because that's setting students

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,030
up for failure but by giving them guided

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,770
structured self teaching exercises okay

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,510
self teaching rubus I was discussing

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,500
with someone before is a new literacy

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,360
okay

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,890
I told my students if you can't if you

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,470
graduate from Grand Valley State and

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,410
can't teach yourself stuff we failed you

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,730
okay discovering basic concepts on their

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,590
own through structured pre-class

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,330
activities

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,770
take the lecture out of the Kibo lecture

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,970
on video if you must although we're

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,370
gonna talk about alternatives that are

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,200
really powerful so now there's very

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,430
little direct instruction that happens

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,310
during class because it all happened

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,200
previous to that so now you have lots

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,880
and lots of minutes to do whatever it is

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,980
you wanted to do and the best thing to

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,300
do is to have students wrestle with time

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,370
for active learning on the more

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,350
difficult parts of the more complex

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,240
tasks that they need to to get through

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,100
in order to learn the stuff okay you

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,320
take all the basics and put it before

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,350
class where it I would argue it belongs

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,120
and suddenly time opens up okay that's

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,980
the flip model of instruction

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,350
it's a pedagogical model whereby

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,330
students get first contact with new

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,580
ideas through structured self teaching

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,140
exercises prior to any group meetings

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,720
then students come into the group

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,220
meeting much time is freed up and that

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,990
group meeting is transformed into a

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,500
dynamic learning environment where the

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,810
instructor is a guide and the student

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,640
has the full spectrum of his or her

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,560
social network in the class to lean upon

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,350
as we're hitting these difficult

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,990
application and analysis activities in

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,490
terms of our 2d model here it's step one

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,050
it's two stages here as well step one

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,420
students encounter these basic things

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,670
before class that's an individual active

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,990
activity okay they're making sense of

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,130
things maybe they're failing at things

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,360
maybe they're failing to make sense

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,540
other things but at least they come with

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,120
the right questions and stage two the

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,590
class time is now freed up to do

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,360
whatever they need to be doing to make

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,520
it to the next level that's usually

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,520
complicated cognitive tasks okay in a

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,230
group that's active so in terms of

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,050
Bloom's taxonomy which is a kind of an

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,370
old-fashioned but still useful way of

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,650
thinking about the structure of

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,880
cognitive tasks with the lower level but

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,350
still important stuff on the bottom

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,320
remembering all the way up through

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,240
creating students encounter this stuff

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,280
in their individual spaces through

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,680
active work okay which they can and

00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,510
should be doing okay and then in class

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,480
it's focused on this stuff so we don't

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,430
do this in class anymore we focus class

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,430
time on that middle third of the Bloom's

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,930
taxonomy period pyramid where really it

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,640
seems like it's getting smaller in area

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,920
but it's getting much larger and

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,010
important so that's what the flipped

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,870
learning model does flip learning has

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,360
been with us for quite a long time in

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,959
one form or another as a

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,370
fireable concept that can be researched

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,459
it's been around for almost 20 years

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,079
it's not a flash in the pan although 90%

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,610
of the published research that has ever

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,990
been published on flipped learning has

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,149
been published in the last three and a

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,810
half years half of it in the last 18

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,880
months okay this is this blog post I

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,410
have here goes into the the details on

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,180
this the number of published research

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,670
article peer-reviewed published research

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,149
articles is currently doubling every 16

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,279
months okay under this model it's a tons

00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,990
and tons of research some of it

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,190
extremely good some of them not very

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,980
good but that's research anywhere I

00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,570
believe and also just lots and lots and

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,730
lots of practice like real-life

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,860
professors using this in the classroom

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,450
and STEM fields and non-stem fields and

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,730
vocational studies and religious

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,740
education everywhere okay all the

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,720
vectors are pointing to this is a great

00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,920
model to help students learn and get

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,510
them to learn how to learn as well so

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,860
we're gonna proceed on to the next phase

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,930
of the talk here and talk about how

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,000
Jupiter notebooks can be used to drive

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,399
flipped learning environments at each of

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,260
these three phases of instruction what

00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,300
students do before a class what students

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,589
do in class and what students do after

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:32,660
class and I'm going to turn it over to

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:36,510
lorena like robert said we are

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,529
identifying a role for jupiter in the

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:44,100
pre class the in class on the post class

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:46,560
stages of a full learning experience

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,339
that we design as instructors right in

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,430
terms of the pre-class work I have three

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:56,339
points one is that to recognize that

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,380
Jupiter really has become a new genre of

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,329
open educational resources open

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,220
educational resources as we are there's

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,070
a whole field and the learning Sciences

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,730
that dedicates themselves to that and

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:10,980
Jupiter has now this role as a new new

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,329
is it's not just about free test

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:18,270
textbooks in this digital age the second

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,070
point is that in the flipped classroom

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,190
model

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,740
we have the opportunity to focus on

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,780
discovery based activities by working

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,150
through the structure of structured

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,120
computational notebook instead of

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,370
passive models for example moving

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,000
lectures to video which is something

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,520
that a lot of people first think of when

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,030
people talk about flip classroom or flip

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:47,720
learning may be a consequence of the

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:52,640
huge popular reach of people like Salman

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,880
Khan and so on popularizing video the

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,710
first thing people think about is moving

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,440
class to video that's the flipped model

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:04,280
it doesn't have to be and in fact it's

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,380
not the best design and the third point

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,000
I want to share with you is this idea of

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,770
the worked example effect which is a

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,180
cognitive load effect that has been

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,950
studied so part of the thing that we

00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,320
wanted to do with Robert here share some

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,670
of the research that we've run into that

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,360
we've discovered that we found very

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,870
helpful to understand why Jupiter is

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,110
being effective in in our applications

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:29,510
of a flip learning so Jupiter first

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,520
Jupiter as a new genre of oer of open

00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,230
educational resources and put a quick

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,970
screenshot there of the first set of

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,300
lessons that we published with my

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:41,090
students this was called a CFG python

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,310
lessons and it was a set of twelve steps

00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,230
leading the students progressively to be

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,580
able to write in python a solution to

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,620
the navier-stokes the navier-stokes

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,030
equations for the physicist or the

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,950
engineers in the room you know that the

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:56,390
navier-stokes equations is kind of scary

00:14:51,950 --> 00:15:01,490
you don't just program this very easily

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:03,710
but we wrote a structured set of lessons

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,850
that were able to lead students to be

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,710
able to write their own solver in in the

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,500
classroom I talk about usually four or

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,570
five weeks in an intensive workshop it

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:19,330
can take a couple of days so it is it is

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:23,360
very effective okay so I put that as my

00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:25,280
my own you know first endeavor into

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,920
publishing open educational resources

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:32,420
with Jupiter but there is a wealth of

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,790
material being put out by many

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,560
caters using Jupiter you have the

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,570
gallery of interesting jupiter novels

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,589
but but of course we have whole books

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,089
being written with jupiter books and

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:47,450
people in the room in fact allen down is

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,370
here in the room hi well the writer of

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,310
books and published in jupiter notebooks

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,399
and also a proponent of the open

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,680
education model so we have lots of

00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,899
people writing tutorials lessons and

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,120
even whole books and publishing this

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,570
openly online and following the open

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,220
source practices of attaching a license

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:11,209
that allows for reuse remix and and

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,639
redistribution of the materials so an

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,800
open maybe i can't create a common CC

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,990
buy on the content and MIT or bsd three

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,320
license on the code so really

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:24,320
representing the open movement there so

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:28,160
as a form of OTR i think that it's

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,230
interesting to to you know step out a

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,699
little bit of our community and

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,579
understand that this is a very big topic

00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:39,699
the recurring issues that people have

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:43,040
been discussing for years in this arena

00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:46,790
are the high cost of textbooks for

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,040
students increasing access for worldwide

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,470
learners to materials and so a lot of

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,990
people putting a lot of effort into

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,060
publishing for example free textbooks on

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,000
the foundation courses for freshman year

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,360
and and so on copyright and licensing

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,949
issues at first a lot of people not on

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,100
you could say even that the development

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:09,230
of the Creative Commons licenses came

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,490
out of this community which initially

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,809
was writing what Scott I think it was

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,089
called the open license or something

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:16,250
previous to Creative Commons you know

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,199
trying to find ways of working around

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,929
the copyright system to be able to share

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,480
educational materials and this idea of

00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:27,439
altruism as a public good so this arc I

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,080
believe the core the topics and issues

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,780
that have concerned the community of oh

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,400
we are but there's something that was

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:39,350
missed in my opinion in this offshoot of

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,780
movement that was inspired by the open

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,900
source so stone Richard Stallman

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,120
Stallman model they

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,980
didn't quite get from because of the

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,250
background this idea of development in

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,960
the open the crucial element of

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:57,070
collaborating and contributing to

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,930
projects as a community and this idea

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,430
they even the idea of community is

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,900
something very important for open source

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,540
projects but oh yeah I didn't

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,850
oh yeah it's never really developed to

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,360
be modified and shared it's about

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:13,000
developing the free economics 101

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,220
textbook that people adopt it's about

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,410
adoption of free materials but not

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,960
really a lot about getting contributions

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,120
back if you think about open course

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,480
we're in MIT for example it was never

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,010
meant to receive contributions and so

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,050
this idea of culture and value based

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,340
framework that we cherish in the open

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,650
source world is something that what

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,410
didn't quite translate to the open

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,610
education movement yet so I think it's

00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,410
an important point to make and to

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,570
understand because when we start using

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,420
Jupiter for creating open educational

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,770
resources just because of where people

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:50,080
are coming from that create open

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:52,750
materials with Jupiter these elements

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,170
start coming back in and I think that's

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:59,830
an important point in the flipped

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:02,650
learning format this is my nice my

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,610
second point now that I want to make in

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:09,790
the this context of the pre class

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,860
situation the typical design is that

00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,320
direct instruction the idea of direct

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,300
instruction like the lecture right is

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,730
moved from the group space to the

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,559
individual space and the typical

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,980
implementation of this that we see is

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,770
videos right but an improved model is

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,780
using discovery based learning instead

00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:31,179
of direct instruction so that the

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:34,150
learners can work through a sequence of

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:36,520
structured computational notebooks

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,870
prepared by the instructor for for the

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,350
student to have a learning experience

00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:44,050
and I want to share with you this piece

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,910
of research a very interesting I want to

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,520
bring up my notes here because I want to

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,710
make sure that I am fair to the to the

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,240
authors when I describe this this is

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,500
research published just in 2016 in the

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,710
in

00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,450
one of the I Triple E computer society

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,860
journals and it was a study using

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,680
undergraduate students in a community

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,900
college and the topic was probability

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,660
theory they had a control group that

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,550
viewed video lectures before coming to

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,860
class to do active learning and then

00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:18,050
they had an intervention group that used

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,490
first a tabletop augmented reality

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,290
system with a calling that tangible user

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,820
interface so these are tabletop systems

00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,700
you see a lot of these tabletop systems

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,380
like in the museum's and things like

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,510
that for young people to interact with

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:36,000
content and these are being used to

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,070
investigate alternatives to presenting

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,510
students with an experience that makes

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,880
them think about something and come

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,680
primed for learning when they come to

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,350
the group space so they have this

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,210
tangible tangible user interface and

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,070
some activity some structure activities

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,930
for the learners to experience before

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:57,290
coming to class it was designed to

00:20:51,930 --> 00:21:02,240
scaffold some you know sequence of steps

00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,240
that were more exploratory than

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,360
explanatory and so the research question

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,840
for them was who does this tangible use

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,150
user interface lead to greater learning

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,770
gains compared to just watching videos

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,140
before class so it is a flip model

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,570
students are being exposed to the

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,880
content first and coming to class for

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,980
that active learning but the question is

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,420
does it make a difference if they are

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,740
exposed through the material through

00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,080
videos or through something that is

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,880
interactive and discovery based they

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,340
found in fact that students that

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:41,670
completed the hands-on activity on the

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:44,340
interactive tabletop and then in I miss

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,990
a point so the student could watch the

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,270
video first and then do an activity or

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,870
vice versa do the interactive activity

00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,100
the tangible use the tangible tabletops

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:56,220
system and then afterwards watch some

00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,720
videos and they found that the students

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:04,070
that have the interactive activity

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,420
before with this did devices perform

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,400
outperform the students who watched the

00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,210
lecture before completing the hand top

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,890
activity

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,570
so that's very interesting they do a lot

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,670
of analysis about this and they frame it

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,790
and in the context of learning Sciences

00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:20,310
to explain how the problem with this

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:23,670
video first approach is that the

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:26,040
students start focusing more on for

00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:30,060
example recalling a particular formula

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:32,280
rather than exploring and applying their

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,770
problems or solving skills so they get

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,500
trapped into this school mode when they

00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:40,050
where they want to remember the formula

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,290
they they saw on the video and it turns

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,870
out the video first group primed to

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,850
memorize was less effective in their

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:51,420
final learning outcomes which I find

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:54,210
very interesting and it makes us think

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,710
that providing students with interactive

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,820
learning experiences with the Jupiter

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:02,460
it's an opportunity to use pre-class

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,220
activities that replace this video

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,130
format for a more effective flipped

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,990
classroom design it's a very interesting

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,640
it's not the only paper of this group

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,290
there are several others looking at

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,650
similar questions and I think it's a

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:21,750
very important research-based support

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:25,910
for our designs options so with

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:28,170
Jupiter's with Jupiter you can use also

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,360
their notebooks as replacement of the

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,550
textbook with a more interactive design

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,760
and I want to talk to you also about

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:39,090
this worked example effect as another

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,400
research based approach that you can use

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,900
when you're designing lessons the work

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,290
example effect is the idea that

00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,200
providing full guidance on how to solve

00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,140
a problem results in better student

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,810
performance than problem solving free

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:59,540
problem-solving which is touted quite a

00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:02,180
lot in the educational circles but

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:05,880
particularly for students that are

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,770
novices and are confronted with

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,520
difficult tasks for example that

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:14,640
science-based content that includes

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,130
computing it turns out that providing a

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,210
worked example that students can follow

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:23,070
through it breaks things down and Scott

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,650
the learning in a way that reduces

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,840
cognitive load and results in better

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,640
learning not I think I have one

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,860
screenshot of a paper of a few papers

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,390
I'm not going to go any further you can

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,910
go to Google Scholar and just search for

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,920
work the example effect and it's become

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,530
it has become a term of art in learning

00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,700
sciences and you can find lots of papers

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:46,740
describing how this effect can help you

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,310
design experiences for your students

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,350
when your topic is complex statistics

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:55,770
mathematics physics and so on and you're

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:57,270
also using computing again programming

00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:01,100
is also difficult especially for

00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:04,200
analysis you can exploit this effect to

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,260
to help your students so that's the

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,430
pre-class a component and I called

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,430
Robert back for the in class

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,360
thanks Lorena so Jupiter notebooks can

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,640
be used as sort of a replacement for the

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,680
typical idea of using video to prepare

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,090
for class by having students actually do

00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,830
things to prepare for class which is a

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,630
great idea when they get to class we

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,640
still want them to be very active and so

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,070
let's talk just very briefly about how

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,600
Jupiter notebooks can be used to promote

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,030
a highly effective active learning

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,200
environment while when students really

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,670
get together and this is really where

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,320
the magic happens with flipped learning

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,550
oh we've read much about flipped

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,950
learning of the flipped classroom the

00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:42,750
discussion tends to be about the videos

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,920
and how do I get the pre-class work how

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,930
do I get students to do the pre-class

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,460
work etc etc but really the focus ought

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,230
to be on what happens during class

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,990
because that's when the really great

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,910
stuff happens with students so I wanted

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,510
to if you got to read one paper in the

00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:59,100
next year or so or any time about active

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,140
learning make it this one this appeared

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,510
in 2014 and the Proceedings of the

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,640
National Academy of Sciences the PNAS

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:08,880
you can get it for free online just

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,800
google PNAS active learning 2014 as a

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,040
free pdf and it's only ten pages long

00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,050
and it is an absolute blockbuster about

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,710
the effectiveness of active learning

00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:21,330
it's a meta-analysis of 225 prior

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,010
studies about active learning which is a

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,550
very broad concept but this brings it

00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,920
all together

00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,260
and it's just absolutely devastating the

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,760
the evidence that it brings to bear

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,250
about the effectiveness of active

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,160
learning I won't spoil it for you but

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,549
just go read it okay seriously

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,250
and so it kind of makes you think about

00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:42,650
what makes for a good active learning

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:45,710
environment so remember in the flip

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:48,410
learning it's setup we're spending our

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,120
class time whatever that may be on that

00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,770
middle third of Bloom's taxonomy we're

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,630
gonna do that because the bottom stuff

00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,010
has already been done okay it's already

00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,360
out of the way students have done it in

00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,370
the right ways they've done it by self

00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,539
teaching okay students sometimes

00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,970
complain about having to teach

00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:03,049
themselves things that's the wrong thing

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,130
to complain about we're in the

00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:08,780
university that's a feature not a bug

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:11,630
having to self teach okay that yes

00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,640
welcome to the first I brain Jupiter con

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,260
up as an example of like a bunch of

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,940
people who are really really good at

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,370
self teaching and that's how you make

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,039
the big bucks okay so what makes a class

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,690
in-class activity effective in the first

00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,640
place well three things that emerge out

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,289
of the research and the PNAS study among

00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,690
other things is a great sort of summary

00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,570
of what's come before and you can spend

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,620
years diving into that literature Oh

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,299
active work during class needs to be

00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,659
challenging but accessible what Lev

00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,950
Vygotsky famous legendary psychologists

00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,710
called the zone of proximal development

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,480
that just means a space where students

00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,360
are learning that's just beyond what

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,010
they know easily how to do but not so

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,020
far beyond that it becomes frustrating

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,669
and it shuts them down yeah we're all

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,679
very familiar with our own zones of

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,470
proximal development a well designed

00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:01,100
class period activity in a class period

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:03,650
he hits that zone dead-on it's a craft

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,510
it's a real art and that's a spend years

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,830
wanting to do that

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,950
well-designed class activities connect

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,630
concepts together okay creating a

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,950
network of ideas that are all joined

00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,210
together it's a powerful learning

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,610
experience both for your long-term

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,919
memory and just we're making sense out

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,419
of things you ever taken linear algebra

00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:22,159
you know what it's like sometimes to

00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:23,510
have a whole bunch of concepts that

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,070
seemingly don't connect with each other

00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,960
but actually underneath it's a whole web

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,690
of beauty that connects these ideas

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,970
together good activities do that

00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,590
and finally the good well design

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,299
activities well design class periods are

00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,950
socially constructivist and that's just

00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,630
a fancy way of saying students are

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,280
making sense coming to terms with

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,990
information and material on their own

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,820
terms but with the help of other people

00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,780
and the class time is the perfect time

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,550
to do that because you

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,810
around a whole bunch of other people who

00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,150
are doing the same thing and the

00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:53,480
professor who is there to guide so I'm

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,100
gonna step off to the side here and this

00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,900
is frankly a little terrifying cuz I'm

00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:04,190
gonna demo some of my own code which is

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:06,080
like awful but I never let imposter

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,080
syndrome get in the way of my career or

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,420
so on so I wanted to show you just a

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,250
very quick demo of this is a mock up

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,050
it's a it's a slightly cleaned up

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:21,200
version of a jupiter notebook that i

00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:22,580
used with a class called called the

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,720
street stretchers for computer science

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,850
i've taught this class several times

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,430
it's your basic garden-variety sort of

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,050
freshman level how to do certain kinds

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:34,010
of math that you need to know to do see

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,480
a set theory counting logic that sort of

00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,950
thing sometimes it shows up in a CS

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,600
department sometimes for us it's in a

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,460
math department this is the kind of

00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,620
class that you get two kinds of students

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,450
you have the students who had just

00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,920
walked out of their basic algebra class

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,110
and are really really apprehensive about

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,030
math or people who learn taught

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,970
themselves how to code in COBOL when

00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,770
they were eight so it's a big big split

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,000
it's a perfect situation for a flipped

00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,100
learning environment and this is an

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,830
example of a notebook or a cleaned up

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,880
example of a notebook on the subject of

00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,380
how do you count the number of

00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,450
permutations of a string where there

00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,550
might be repeated characters now there's

00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,160
a famous formula for this and I could

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,960
straight up lecture on that formula it's

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,180
n factorial divided by a whole bunch of

00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,810
other factorials and you would forget it

00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,130
in ten minutes

00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,200
and you'd have no personal connection

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:21,100
that formula whatsoever okay

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,540
better to spend a little bit more time

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,920
discovering that formula for yourself or

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,230
at least discovering the need for a

00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,730
formula by yourself and then come back

00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,710
to it later and you're gonna have a much

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,870
much deeper connection in your long-term

00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,510
memory about this formula and know where

00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,310
it came from that would be great so this

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,610
so we review a little bit

00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,230
I have students say you know just to

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,880
warm up give me all the permutations of

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,400
the string heck just write them all out

00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,320
okay there 24 of them and and if you're

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,270
working groups it's quick work then try

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,910
to be a little bit more profane and use

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,990
hell instead and you select wait a

00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,820
minute even though it's the same length

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,920
there's there's fewer permutations I go

00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,440
oh something's going on here

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,210
we better

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,540
my attention is now piqued and I better

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:05,190
start to start to think about this so in

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,080
this code here where I'm introducing

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,000
students to the itertools package so

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,500
let's go ahead and load that and look I

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,120
don't even know if I use new and PI in

00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,520
this code here but I had there I just

00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,580
always put import new PI just to be safe

00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,040
that import everything from everything

00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,930
right just dump it in there and it's

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,760
this will print off all the permutations

00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,980
of a string so you can just kind of use

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,410
it to explore ok so if you didn't know

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,090
this already so this is something I

00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,800
would have students do experiment and

00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,300
try to make a conjecture this is

00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,580
something we do in mathematics is what

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,380
mathematicians do we play we experiment

00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,000
and we try to make conjectures about

00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,170
stuff that we're observing a lot of

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,450
people don't understand that about

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,420
mathematics it's not just computation so

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,520
in this code here it just prints off a

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,930
you know what what are the number of

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,280
permutations of a list of length or

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,900
whatever and I asked you in Sergei

00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,180
what's the pattern what do you see here

00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,340
it's not exponential what is it and

00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,290
eventually someone will strike upon that

00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,800
oh it's in factorial assistant facto 8

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:03,150
factorial is 40,320 and so their job in

00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,530
groups as we're working together in

00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,000
class is to just fill in the blank

00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,860
what's the number of permutations of a

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,570
list or string of length Eon and I'll

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,450
put down n factorial I figure like wow

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:16,110
that's a great day's work except it's

00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,400
not the whole story ok so now let's try

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,110
this out let's test it so I'm going to

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,490
use Lorena's name here and we'll just

00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,310
say ok well the number of permutations

00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,680
for lorena is 720 that's awesome that

00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:29,160
seven factorial so so far we just did

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,190
some math except what if I use my name

00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,630
ok same length or actually it's a little

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,870
character longer but the same number of

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:39,480
permutations what just happened and well

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,100
why wasn't this the I have it students

00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,510
are about doing anything in here except

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,890
just walking around saying like you know

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,170
what you're doing you okay

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:49,110
got any questions what's going on tell

00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:53,460
me that's my role I'm the guide I get

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:55,050
out of the way okay and wow something's

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,670
going on here so I have them this is

00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,140
this is code I would have them write I'm

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,330
just showing you the results there's

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,400
another one here right write a function

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,680
called distinct perms that just prints

00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,900
off the distinct permutations of a

00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,810
string okay do that real quick this is

00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,370
quick dirty ugly non functional code and

00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,600
it's brilliantly wonder

00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,610
all for getting students to learn things

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,320
so here I put in some things here they

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,910
can just write out they can use leverage

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,580
the packages in Python to actually write

00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,800
out those things and now let's extend

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,170
this in write function that's called how

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,420
many perms it just says that prints off

00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,250
these things so if I use Lorena here for

00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,490
example okay the number of permutations

00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,809
720 number of distinct permutations is 7

00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,740
or 20 that's great what if I had an

00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:39,500
extra a though oh it's not the same but

00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,660
what do you notice

00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,340
well once twice the other okay that

00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,929
can't be a coincidence what if I put

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,490
another a on here is it gonna be three

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:50,490
times the other so students are asking

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,720
these questions themselves oh yeah so

00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,330
there's our short coming up my code

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,190
there we go oh no it's not three times

00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,940
the other what is it oh it's six times

00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:01,440
the other mmm what's going on here okay

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,559
so that's what I'm asking students to

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,140
figure out tell me what is going on here

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,370
okay and that's what the class is

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,500
they're writing code they're

00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:16,230
experimenting they're making conjectures

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:17,940
and then the culmination of all this the

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,070
culmination of all that is to explain

00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,020
okay get up to the board and explain

00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,730
what's happening here make a conjecture

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,919
and explain why you think it's true

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:29,100
and don't use data because data don't

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,389
prove mathematical conjectures okay give

00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,120
me an explanation it shows why it's

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:34,740
always going to be this and this is

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,389
something that we get done in 50 minutes

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,070
but we couldn't get it done in 20

00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,050
minutes okay that's where the flipping

00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,700
comes in okay you flip the class and get

00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,560
the the basic stuff out of the way like

00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,940
what is a permutation how what is the

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,830
definition of permutation was the

00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,480
definition of a factorial how to compute

00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,070
the first 20 factorials and writing

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,980
beyond a list on a post-it note and keep

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,659
it with you get that out of the way that

00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,380
students can do that and then come to

00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:03,120
class and we'll do the good stuff okay

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:04,950
thanks okay so that's what a my that is

00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,300
was a very successful class for me these

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,070
are students with just basic algebra

00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,150
background and they can totally conquer

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,360
that and they learned some really cool

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,830
stuff very deeply okay and now I'm gonna

00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,420
hand over to Lorena to close this out

00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,470
here and talk about what happens after

00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,470
class with Jupiter

00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:26,289
um let's see I'm not sure how we're

00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,549
running on time as tomorrow minutes oh

00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:29,809
yeah well we want to leave some question

00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:32,359
for discussion so I'm gonna race a

00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:34,190
little bit through it because - just

00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:37,430
leave some time for discussion

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,319
and I wanted to tell you about well

00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,940
would you still want to do some more you

00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:42,799
still want to sign some work for the

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,789
students so what do you do we still want

00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:48,890
to use we found that Jupiter fits in all

00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:52,430
of these stages and it fits perfectly in

00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,980
the assignment and post post class work

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,349
but in particular I wanna emphasize

00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:01,339
students creating their own content let

00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:03,440
me mention that stephen downes is a sort

00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,519
of a philosopher learning scientists in

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,559
Canada

00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:10,099
he writes wonderful blog postings and

00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,779
there's some lectures of him on YouTube

00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,329
and he's written a lot about open

00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:16,160
education and he in one talk that I

00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:18,079
heard recently he said you know we make

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,970
a lot of oh we are open educational

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,000
resources space there's very little

00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,859
reuse and then he went on to say the

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,829
reality is that the people who get the

00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:31,029
most out of creating oer are the ones

00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:33,799
who wrote it and so then it goes on to

00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:37,609
that you know the corollary of that is

00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:39,470
that the final step that you want to

00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:41,720
ensure that the learners the students

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,039
get to start creating their own content

00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,829
because that's when they're going to

00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,569
really learn the most and so you want to

00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,279
emphasize that to not only just have

00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:51,619
them work through your structured

00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:54,079
activities but Don's also encourage them

00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:57,140
guide them through to become authors of

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,299
their own content in terms of the so

00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,039
this is a code III at first I want to

00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:03,940
share with you from some surveys on the

00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,380
class that we taught last semester for

00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,940
undergraduates with using Jupiter the

00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,710
students said that Jupiter made the

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,509
class the way more interactive because

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,309
you could go back and ad the notebook if

00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:15,410
there's something the students didn't

00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:16,490
understand or wasn't clear enough she

00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:20,269
could easily go back and add more

00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,920
explanations I think she means me I add

00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:22,430
more explanations for a chapter in the

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,259
notebook

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,990
almost like a textbook you could

00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:31,339
continuously edit I couldn't when that's

00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:33,440
a quote the student identifying with the

00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:35,480
process of starting from the materials

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,250
we provided them and then then becoming

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,190
editors of that material but eventually

00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,170
you want them to become creators the

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:47,079
idea of computable content I want to

00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:49,640
share with you as a very powerful

00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,829
summary of what we have here with

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,450
Jupiter this idea that we can create as

00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:55,400
instructors and the students can create

00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,170
as learners educational content that is

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,849
made powerfully interactive with the

00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,859
compute engine so interleaving the

00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:03,710
programming with the other forms of

00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:05,480
media and this is just a screenshot of

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:10,180
an online learning platform that we have

00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,829
and a where we have an assessment using

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,569
Jupiter and I just wanted to introduce

00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:16,490
you to the fact that we have created

00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:18,559
also some tools to provide automatic

00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,230
grading and I can tell you more about

00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,539
this on in the hallway in the interest

00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,190
of time but it's the opportunity to

00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:26,299
provide auto graded assignments you've

00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,740
seen Jupiter I think it's really

00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:29,329
important to provide instant feedback

00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,950
for the students and to give them many

00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:32,960
opportunities to do their assignments

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,720
and submit them again and again and and

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,279
see how they're going so I won't go into

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,670
the details you can ask me later

00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:44,680
for this particular component of auto

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:47,930
graded assignments and my final slide

00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,970
summarizing some of the key design

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:53,690
principles I think of flipped learning

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,890
with Jupiter the idea of interactive the

00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,039
fact that they are interactively on

00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:59,869
computation is an important design

00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,230
feature the idea of creating creating

00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:05,269
guided exploration before a normative

00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:08,079
explanation so discovery based learning

00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:10,730
through the computation on notebooks

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,180
using active learning in class we do a

00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:15,470
lot of live coding for example and also

00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,089
structured exercises where the students

00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,940
are working together with other students

00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:24,410
and finally a very important component

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:26,509
that I want to emphasize is guiding the

00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,799
students to learning through creating

00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:32,180
their own content through projects or

00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:35,150
challenging opportunities for them to

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:38,720
write their own notebooks and with that

00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:41,290
I want to leave open the room for for

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:48,219
questions and discussion thank you

00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:48,219
[Applause]

00:39:48,830 --> 00:40:00,080
someone with a mic there if you want to

00:39:51,170 --> 00:40:02,510
ask a question I thank you for the

00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,640
presentation I had a question about you

00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:06,500
know when you run that in your class how

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,210
many students can you handle in 50

00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,290
minutes

00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,630
what was the last thing how many

00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:15,260
students are you able to handle with

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:18,560
that 50 minute you know session my

00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,480
classes are capped at 34 but there's no

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,080
reason that couldn't scale up to 10

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,960
times that amount with some assistance

00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,090
possibly maybe some technological I mean

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,320
it's a little harder to get around from

00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,240
group to group to group but that can be

00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,320
done at scale it's been done in larger

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,030
universities as well

00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:45,040
NC State that stuff like that not a

00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:45,040
Jupiter but thank you

00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:59,250
it's back to continuing what I think we

00:40:53,010 --> 00:41:22,320
were almost talk about alway and I think

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:24,810
is doing it thank you for you yeah thank

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,690
you for your question Jason um I I think

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:29,790
it's it it's crucial that we go back to

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,490
those principles of the open source

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:35,610
software movement and apply them in the

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,830
open education world as well I think it

00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:39,960
has been lost a little bit in the focus

00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:44,160
in oer and and free textbooks on all of

00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,490
that and one of the reasons for being

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,710
here for Robert and I started discussing

00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,760
these things and got we work in

00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,230
different fields he's a mathematician

00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,450
I'm an engineer we teach different

00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,400
classes but if we were teaching the same

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,410
classes we could be collaborating on you

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,150
know how do you teach this and so on one

00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:05,310
thing I want to mention is the Journal

00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,490
of open source education we've founded

00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:11,160
this journal about just a few months ago

00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:15,960
with the purpose of publishing a paper

00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:18,030
about a say learning module that

00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,800
includes a full narrative with the

00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:22,520
worked examples to lead to some

00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,480
particular learning objectives and

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,830
Tracy's here she's part of their

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,480
founding editorial board Jason are you

00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:33,870
in the editorial board that we reel you

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,620
in yes good and Robert as well so

00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:39,720
several people in the room and the idea

00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,610
is to provide a place where we can start

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,700
indexing some of those materials and

00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:47,970
also providing some peer review to

00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:51,090
improve the the the presentation of the

00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:53,010
materials often you know for example a

00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,559
sort of Jupiter numbers that were

00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:58,680
prepared to do an live tutorial in

00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:01,019
type I confess or PyCon or so on might

00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,400
not be finished enough to be able to be

00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:07,289
adopted by another instructor alone just

00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,910
by landing on that github repo so

00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:11,009
through some peer review we can improve

00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,410
those aspects of it so that they become

00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:16,349
more reusable and they become findable

00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:18,239
through getting a DOI and so on so we

00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:19,680
are doing some organizing some

00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:31,469
self-organized to try to promote

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:34,170
collaboration and join us David Koch

00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:36,059
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth do

00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:38,430
you guys teach in an institution where

00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:41,009
you have students all have laptops do

00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:45,420
you work the students in groups or do

00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:50,789
you teach in a computing lab okay that

00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:52,199
is a very tender response because a lot

00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:54,509
of conversations have been going on

00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,930
there's a Jupiter in education Google

00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:57,449
group

00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:59,309
even though perhaps 70% of the

00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:02,789
conversation they are devolved into

00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:04,709
DevOps discussions there's a big

00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:06,689
component of discussing how do you bring

00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:08,249
this to your students how do you you

00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:10,170
know do the students in all in stone and

00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:13,769
I conduct the growing consensus is that

00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:16,049
it's better for the beginners to be

00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:17,189
provided with some cloud-based solution

00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:19,559
where they all have the same environment

00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:21,479
providing Jupiter hub for example in the

00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:22,859
university if that is possible through I

00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:25,559
managed to do that at my university

00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:26,880
through convincing the library that this

00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:28,380
was something that they should provide

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,999
through academic technologies it took me

00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,179
about nine months and hundreds of emails

00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:35,369
but finally I got it so it can be done

00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:37,499
and they're providing a Jupiter 1/2 to

00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:39,209
single sign-on for four for all the

00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:41,789
university initially it was a pilot for

00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,199
my students but now it's open that group

00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:44,729
that is very important because there's

00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,729
an equity issue there the students can

00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:50,880
come in with a tablet we also I am also

00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:53,729
teaching in a computer lab so I'm it is

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,410
a kind of like a scale-up lab where

00:44:53,729 --> 00:44:57,779
everybody has this roundtables and so on

00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,429
and we will out laptops for everybody

00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:01,589
that I couldn't that the people from

00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:05,069
academic technologies lay out for it for

00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:06,959
the class where we also have the I also

00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:09,359
managed to get it all installed with

00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:11,309
anaconda locally just in case

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,959
or for more advanced courses you would

00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:16,410
move to use them perhaps a local

00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:20,430
installation but what we don't want is

00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:24,269
to look for therefore the teaching staff

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,979
my TAS and myself to become IT support

00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:27,749
of the students with their own local

00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:30,719
installations so you want to delay as

00:45:27,749 --> 00:45:34,019
much as possible the self install until

00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,849
the students are eager enough to wanna

00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:37,529
solve problems by themselves and they're

00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:39,029
eager enough to Google and solve their

00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:40,380
problems because they really want to

00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:42,569
install it in their machines right

00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,549
before that provide everything in the

00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:47,789
cloud has been the consensus solution

00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:50,190
let me add to my University is a large

00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:51,900
public university we serve a lot of

00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,859
first-generation college students a lot

00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,630
of students from lower income

00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,900
backgrounds many of those students don't

00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,309
have their own technology at all we I

00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,979
just take a tiered approach we don't

00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:04,410
teach it in a computer lab I my policy

00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:07,709
is if you have a laptop Windows or Linux

00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:11,759
or Mac laptop an anaconda on it if you

00:46:07,709 --> 00:46:13,049
do not have a laptop use Co calc those

00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:16,619
guys are represented here it's a great

00:46:13,049 --> 00:46:19,469
product we also purchased 50 Chromebooks

00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:21,089
to keep in our office and there are

00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:24,119
brilliant devices I have one right here

00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:25,289
myself and those can access the web just

00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,089
as well as anything we just loaned them

00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:29,039
out as we need a need a Chromebook on

00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:31,339
the office and grab one and it solved

00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,339
all of our problems

00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:38,430
Steven Hauser from Bowdoin College in

00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:40,469
Maine in terms of the pre-course

00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:43,019
material the structured work ahead the

00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:44,430
in-class assignments the open

00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:47,160
educational resources are just

00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:49,529
astounding and wonderful but when it

00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,630
comes to assessment that same openness

00:46:49,529 --> 00:46:54,150
lends itself to students just googling

00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:56,789
for the answers how do you address sort

00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,099
of you know especially as we share more

00:46:56,789 --> 00:47:02,160
of the same exercises across colleges

00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:03,239
some don't necessarily have some of the

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,009
students don't necessarily have that

00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:07,499
ethical standard not to post their

00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:10,019
answers online how do we approach that

00:47:07,499 --> 00:47:11,729
how do we solve that problem I think

00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:13,019
gonna change completely the way you

00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:15,809
think about assessment

00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:18,779
you cannot assess things anymore if they

00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:20,069
can be googled if the first step for me

00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:21,809
what I'm designing an assessment is to

00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:22,830
Google it and if it pops up on Stack

00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:25,950
Exchange I don't

00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:28,020
I stopped okay for me a good it's

00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,890
impossible to block entirely I think I

00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,770
think at some point you just have to

00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:34,770
trust your students too but also I think

00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:37,230
assessments that involve bringing in

00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,640
real data for students that choose their

00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,470
own problems and making a little bit

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,840
more authentic and personal makes it

00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,730
less likely to be cheated upon because

00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,500
students have a stake in and also it's

00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,300
hard to replicate something when you've

00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,310
picked the data I mean if I have two

00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,750
students that pick the exact data set

00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,400
for the exact problem they're

00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,680
collaborating okay that's that's that's

00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,950
at least easily detectable so it really

00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,180
requires us and here in 2018 to think

00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,250
about different ways of assessing

00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,700
student work other than you know what

00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:10,620
maybe work for us and a final comment on

00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:11,910
Donna I I've come to believe that it's a

00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,710
very important to trust your students

00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:17,010
but also as an instructor is not my job

00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:19,050
to put my job to police the students and

00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:21,030
when I start policing the students it

00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:23,220
becomes an adversarial relationship and

00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:31,410
so I find it more important to try to

00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:37,670
develop a environment where by peer not

00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:42,180
pressure but by just by by a sense of of

00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:44,360
joint investment in their learning

00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:49,200
process the students themselves start

00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:51,120
applying conditions they self-organized

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,160
but you have to develop it's a community

00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,280
building effort to create that kind of

00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,280
atmosphere

00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,180
please join me in giving Renault

00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:13,610
applause for our speakers

00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:13,610
