thank you everyone welcome to Jupiter

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,790
akan I hope everybody has a fantastic

00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,950
time while they're here and I'm really

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,139
delighted to be able to talk about some

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,819
of my favorite things so learning

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:21,149
learning enables businesses to build

00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:25,769
prosperity academics to share knowledge

00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:27,059
and researchers to explore new ideas but

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,579
it does much more than that

00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:37,350
in fact in seventh grade it got me into

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:40,760
the math team who doesn't want to be on

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,969
the math team we love the math team

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,960
picture this it's 1977 I'm in sixth

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,030
grade I am kind of a rebellious team but

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,739
my passions are playing soccer and

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,070
learning the laws of physics the hard

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,469
way but that's a story for another day

00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:01,140
that year I spent much of my day in a

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,050
class called project venture project

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,990
venture was for kids that were advanced

00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:11,610
in math or language arts now there were

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,369
four people in my class myself and three

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,790
nerdy math team boys who only wanted to

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,009
play Dungeons and Dragons during class

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,590
pretty soon I began skipping these

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,479
project venture classes and astutely

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,240
thinking that the teacher would not miss

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:33,259
one of her four students when she sent

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,090
notes home about my wonderful behavior i

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:39,000
crumbled up the notes and threw them

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,759
most of them in the trash thankfully at

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,759
the start of seventh grade a thing of

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:50,579
wonder entered my life the Apple two

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,820
wisest little box its color simple

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,729
language and interactivity drew me in it

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,399
had amazing colors other than the green

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,409
or amber or gray of the bell labs

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,130
mainframe that I was using the year

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,940
before I really wanted to learn how to

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:12,810
use this thing of wonder the Apple to

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,440
put me in control and let me experiment

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,520
I had a blank canvas to create from I

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,110
learned by writing small programs and

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,240
iterating when things didn't work the

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,190
best part of the graphics were the

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,459
graphics they were amazing did I mention

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,890
we had color finally it took me a couple

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,590
months until I could recreate the Atari

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:39,030
breakout game on the Apple 2 but at the

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,569
end of that I was hooked so one day the

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,160
three D&D boys and their math team coach

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,709
asked me to compete with them in an

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,630
upcoming competition they felt for

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,739
whatever reason that I would improve

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,760
their chances being a cool kid and maybe

00:02:52,739 --> 00:03:00,450
not a rule follower I didn't want to go

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,420
yet I knew my 3d classmates had worked

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,980
very hard and wanted me to join them so

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,930
ultimately I agreed to go I did okay in

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,530
my one-and-only math team competition

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,630
taking sixth out of 240 students but

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,959
more importantly I learned a valuable

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,970
life lesson that day about helping

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,290
others and that wouldn't have happened

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:28,680
unless the Apple two opened the door for

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,360
me to learning and also to connect to

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:38,519
other people share wonder changed the

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:42,000
world the Apple 2 did that for me quite

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:45,570
unexpectedly in 2013 I felt those same

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,959
feelings of wonder and possibilities

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,750
again when I began using the notebook

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,690
like minecraft of this generation or the

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,590
Apple 2 when I was twelve the notebook

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,470
was fun and it was empowering the

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,540
notebook encouraged me to explore there

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,540
were no artificial barriers to getting

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,170
started just type some things and hit

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,040
shift enter

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:13,470
I personally began exploring music 21 a

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,690
music theory library and found it could

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,590
do quite powerful things in five lines

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:23,250
of code or less music as the notebooks

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,240
have a universal appeal while using

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,070
these notebooks

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,550
when volunteering at fab lab in San

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,819
Diego

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,190
a community makerspace I found that kids

00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:35,990
and adults who had never programmed were

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,580
intrigued and wanted to create music

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,129
when I pulled up a digital synthesizer

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,340
example using notebooks in the widgets I

00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,979
found students and myself asking what if

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,129
we try this what if we do that this is

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:53,550
really cool the interactivity and

00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:57,210
visualization of information engaged us

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,759
and inspired us to learn more when

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,870
teaching Python workshops I saw the

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,060
notebook broke down the barriers of fear

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,190
whether learning introductory Python or

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,810
whether people were experienced our

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,169
developers learning the Python

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,360
scientific stack in addition to

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:18,740
individuals at our community workshops

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,000
at the same time businesses academics

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:25,680
researchers were exploring the notebooks

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,900
as well in 2014 my dear friend

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,190
Lorena Barbra gave an enthusiastic

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,199
keynote at SCI PI 2014 about how the

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,650
notebooks were connecting her students

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,479
to learning I agreed wholeheartedly and

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,520
hope the Vote notebooks would go viral

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,120
and Wow

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,279
go viral they did now it's 2018 and

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,169
we've seen huge adoption of the

00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,909
notebooks in many disciplines

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:53,610
we've got close to three million

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:55,860
notebooks in the wild and Jupiter and

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,830
our many contributors were recently

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:03,419
honored with the ACM software systems

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,190
award so now as I look forward to the

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,310
next five years there are so many

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,139
possibilities for our future as I think

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,580
back to my time as a software

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,979
engineering manager

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,699
or a product manager at a Silicon Valley

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:20,090
startup serving the new cellular phone

00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,259
industry and as a grad student

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,840
researching and writing a thesis on

00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,300
applied economics I could see how the

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,330
notebook would profoundly would have

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,270
profoundly impacted my work in each of

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,060
these cases I want you to take a moment

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,440
and think about how you plan to use the

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,800
notebooks in the next few years

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,410
in the worlds of Wild Disney a creator

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,770
of wonder if you dream it you can build

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,380
it and looking at our future I believe

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,890
that open source is our greatest

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,890
strength it gives us superpowers open

00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,380
source lets us achieve things like

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:04,850
Jupiter that would be impossible to do

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:07,670
alone yet open source is also our

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:11,660
Achilles heel there are different

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:13,730
threats to our open source world

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,280
some examples are free riders who use

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,260
the tools but neglect cost and maximize

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,590
their own personal benefit

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,080
there's also complacent bystanders who

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,660
think someone else will do the work or

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,540
support of open source perhaps I don't

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,730
need to and then there's maintainer

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:38,120
burnout due to the lack of support

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:40,250
running on limited labor and with little

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,250
recognition for the work that people put

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:47,540
in everyday these all impact our

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:49,790
possibility for success so what can we

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,400
and Jupiter do to fulfill the mission of

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,070
the future some of our options are

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,400
include experimenting with some new

00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,650
business models such as some innovative

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,310
businesses like tide lifts or quants

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:06,380
aiight are doing we could turn open we

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,870
could turn the project into an open

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,160
source business we could charge users

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,950
for support

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,090
we could put even more effort into grant

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:19,190
funding or I'd like to think that we can

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,010
bring together two perspectives from

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,890
economics and I want to talk with you a

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,230
little bit about a possible approach

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,910
that can perhaps further future

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:34,070
discussion together business people

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,640
academics and researchers need to raise

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:40,729
the bar we need to find out are we

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,370
asking the right questions do we know

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,130
what infrastructure people and resources

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:50,240
a project needs now and in the future

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,529
and are we sharing the answers to those

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,220
questions in an open and transparent

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:58,290
parent way we talk a lot about

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,720
sustainability but what do we really

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,449
mean when we say that infrastructure

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,610
people working on existing projects to

00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:09,410
improve quality and the user experience

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,089
there's a number of questions about that

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,089
Elinor Ostrom of Nobel prize-winning

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,860
economists did research on common pooled

00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:20,850
resources and the tragedy of the Commons

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,189
and she found that the tragedy of the

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,249
Commons is when individuals try to

00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:33,209
maximize their personal benefit at the

00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:36,300
expense of the group now happily she her

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:39,209
early work found that people were

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,110
willing to work together as a group

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:45,569
and her early research dealt with farms

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,670
and limited resources but later in her

00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:51,209
career she started looking at knowledge

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:55,019
and the digital information that is in

00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:57,389
this world she felt that it was

00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,769
important that we learn to deal with the

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:03,379
complexity other than just rejecting it

00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,899
she felt that the danger of

00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:08,839
oversimplifying problems would lead us

00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,329
to solutions that weren't effective

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:15,389
instead what she found was people can

00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:18,589
self organize and create communities and

00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:21,149
sent rules that fit their system and

00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:24,660
they can be successful

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:28,740
she felt learning to trust was central

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,870
to this cooperation maintaining the

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,779
foundation of our projects is important

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,850
unseen labor and invisible

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,699
infrastructure make it difficult for

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,889
businesses and users to see the large

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:44,399
effort that's going into sustaining an

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,470
ongoing project we need better

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,350
communications between users and

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,839
providers to reduce the possibility that

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,629
one group or one person is taken

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,079
advantage of this takes effort intention

00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:00,689
and desire sustaining while important

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,449
does not evoke the same feelings of

00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:06,390
urgency and wonder as new uses of

00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:08,579
Jupiter sustaining tends to

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,850
perfect serving the status quo and

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:14,430
sustaining alone does not bring us new

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:20,279
products and services lifelong learning

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:23,310
or prevent or cure Alzheimer's by moving

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:27,000
the discussion from just sustaining to

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:29,490
also including open innovation one of my

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,160
former professors Eric von Hippel had

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,240
done a lot of research work on

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,720
entrepreneurship and innovation and

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:41,250
economics an innovation encourages many

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,070
new products and projects and we have

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,050
now easier access to engineering tools

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,269
and a wealth of information on the

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,720
Internet and what we're seeing is many

00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:54,029
more user interface vader's the makers

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,120
of our world and they're making things

00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:00,290
to meet their needs and not necessarily

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,149
are they motivated by profits alone

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,250
business academia and research each have

00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,500
their own strengths so let's play the

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,110
each group strengths businesses are

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,279
skilled at efficient workflows scaling

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:16,920
production and reducing cost academia is

00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,790
great at sharing knowledge researchers

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,870
bring new insights and focus on details

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:26,610
by leveraging these strengths businesses

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:32,459
academics and researchers create real

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:36,120
value each work they do helps us in some

00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:39,079
way for example in business value can

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,579
come from improving processes and

00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,980
improving their own people's skills and

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:47,839
knowledge or by building new uses within

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,120
on top of the platform that exists I

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,820
think we should look for solutions that

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,790
combine both Saints sustainability and

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,880
innovation and work together to

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,670
accomplish them Jupiter notebooks have

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,579
rapidly become the de facto standard in

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,040
data science it's the first time in a

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,949
long time that we have a universal

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,029
intuitive and understandable way to

00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:16,829
change data into knowledge and actions I

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:20,070
talked about consortiums but naming is

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:23,520
hard but the bigger key is I want us

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,490
to find solutions to support Jupiter and

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:30,150
related projects and I think to do that

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:33,750
we need to create value for individuals

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,580
and also for organizations and by

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,550
creating value I think we'll be

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:41,790
successful but I need your help to

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,340
sustain Jupiter and and the existing

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,520
projects and also to innovate and find

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,940
new uses to create value to delight us

00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,540
and improve our lives so what can we

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,880
specifically do Fernando Perez shared

00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,080
some good first steps when he reflected

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,880
back on John hunters work on matplotlib

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:08,130
John encouraged people to set the bar

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,410
high for your dreams and goals he

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,950
reminded folks to act with

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:17,330
uncompromising integrity never-ending

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:20,220
intellectual curiosity and to practice

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:24,900
unbounded generosity to all who cross

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:28,400
your path share wonder changed the world

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,700
it's my sincere hope that in five years

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:37,230
we're back here attending Jupiter con

00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:40,490
2023 and that we say wow look at all the

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:43,290
amazing things and how much we

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,650
businesses academics and researchers

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:49,290
have accomplished together by embracing

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,260
the Wonder and possibilities that

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:55,590
Jupiter offers we have the power to

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,740
connect create value connect lifelong

00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:01,780
learners and most importantly improve

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:06,090
the world that we share thank you

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,090
[Applause]
