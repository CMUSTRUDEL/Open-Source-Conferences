	00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,629
Netflix knows how to scale we're getting

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:11,309
pretty good at it we know how to scale

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:14,070
globally in 2016 at the push of a button

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,800
we launched in a hundred and thirty

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,480
countries simultaneously today we have a

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,449
hundred and thirty million customers in

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
a hundred and ninety countries worldwide

00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:26,010
we know how to scale infrastructure in

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,230
the United States during peak hours we

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,189
account for roughly one third of all

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:37,440
Internet traffic and we know how to

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:40,530
scale data every day we write more than

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,390
one trillion events into our stream and

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,510
ingestion pipeline this data is

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:51,000
processed and loaded into a 100

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:54,059
petabytes cloud native data warehouse we

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,100
use this data to constantly improve the

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,710
product and we don't do this in one fell

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,750
swoop we are constantly testing and

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,559
rolling out changes to the product

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,510
experience iteratively we also try to

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,210
innovate on the product we recently

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,700
launched smart downloads which allow us

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,380
to better serve our members in less

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,030
developed countries while also reducing

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,680
your bandwidth cost here domestically we

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,790
are on track to spend eight billion

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,280
dollars on content this year alone we

00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,530
use our data to help us understand how

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,350
to best spend that money we want to

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,540
deliver content that is not just broadly

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,270
compelling but the content that delivers

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,020
a delightful experience to every one of

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,750
our members and lastly we use the data

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,939
to help us innovate in the studio

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,829
engineering space and to push the

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,450
boundaries of what's possible right now

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,210
we are experimenting with branching

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,520
narratives which is a 2-0 next choose

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,600
your own adventure experience for a

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,180
television series so how have we done

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,280
this well we've done the scaling in

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,680
large part through tools and

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,950
infrastructure and the question we're

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,400
asking ourselves today is how can we

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,210
best help our people scale how can we

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,890
make it easier for them to

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,500
work with the data and do these really

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,440
cool things for you guys we believe the

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,570
answer is again in large part through

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,630
tooling and infrastructure which is why

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:32,020
we are looking at Jupiter we believe

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:35,260
Jupiter is a very critical part of the

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,650
strategy for us so we're making some big

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,620
bets around it the first is that when we

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,100
look at the future and we try to think

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,110
what does it look like to work with data

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,210
we think it looks an awful lot like a

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,780
notebook experience so we are going

00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:55,870
all-in on Jupiter

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:59,410
we think that notebooks are capable of

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,900
so much more than just an interactive

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,820
experience right now we are in the

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:10,840
process of migrating 10,000 workflows to

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,400
run through a notebook which by the time

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,650
we're done will be a hundred and fifty

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:21,060
thousand notebook jobs every single day

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:24,370
and lastly we believe that notebooks

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,650
might help us cross the chasm that

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,400
exists between our technical and

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,380
non-technical people when you look at

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,880
the type of users we have in a company

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,770
we have the people who are primarily

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,840
tasked with delivering a data product

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,060
these are your data engineers working on

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,450
data sets or delivering a tableau

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,000
dashboard that data and those products

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,640
are used by people to then deliver

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,240
insights on that data which is used by

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,670
people across the company to make data

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,210
informed decisions and to roll out new

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,640
improvements to the product today we're

00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,400
serving the people who most closely

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,250
resemble data scientists with a notebook

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,660
and we want to constantly and continue

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,810
to improve that experience for them as

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,600
well right now we are seeing an increase

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,480
in the people who are primarily tasked

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,100
with producing data they are

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,359
increasingly using notebooks and so we

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,030
want to leverage notebooks for their

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,410
experience as well but we still have

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,030
this chasm that exists between the

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,130
people who primarily focus on working

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,160
with data and people whose boat

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,560
this lies somewhere else and it is our

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,470
belief that a notebook is capable of

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,540
delivering a single experience that can

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:43,990
support every single type of user on

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:47,080
this slide that is why we are leaning

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,350
into simplicity integration and

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,310
collaboration with the UI and that's why

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,850
you're seeing the work that we're doing

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:59,230
with interact right now we are committed

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,490
to to open sourcing the work that we do

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,190
and to contributing it back to the

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,710
projects whenever possible and it is my

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,100
sincere hope that you will collaborate

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,230
with us so that we can collectively

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,190
reimagine what it means to look like to

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:17,600
work with data thank you

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,600
[Applause]

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,480
