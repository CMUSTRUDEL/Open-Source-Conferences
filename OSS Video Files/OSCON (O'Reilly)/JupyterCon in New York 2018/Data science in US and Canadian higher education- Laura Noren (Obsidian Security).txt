Title: Data science in US and Canadian higher education- Laura Noren (Obsidian Security)
Publication date: 2018-09-21
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	Laura Noren offers an overview of a research project—conducted jointly by researchers at NYU and UC Berkeley—on the various infrastructure models supporting data science in research settings in terms of funding, educational uses, and research utilization. Laura then shares some of the findings, comparing the national federation model currently established in Canada, with the support of the Canadian federal government, to the more grassroots efforts in many US universities. The research project utilizes spoken and written interviews, evaluation surveys, and reviews of public posts about data science infrastructure on GitHub from more than 50 different US and Canadian institutions to understand the specifics of the current infrastructures and systems.

all right we're gonna get started and I

00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,570
am gonna give people a few more minutes

00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,249
to roll in and in so doing give you a

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,959
little preview this in case you haven't

00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:13,669
noticed cuz it's a little early in the

00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:16,779
moment it's not that early it's early if

00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:20,170
you're from the west coast which I am

00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:22,519
this whole room for today is essentially

00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,550
educational kinds of things using

00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,869
Jupiter so I preview a few things in

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,179
this talk I didn't even realize I was

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,039
doing this but we're hearing from folks

00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,840
in Canada who have set up a very

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,820
interesting system for dealing with

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,530
Jupiter hubs in the next and the

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,180
immediately preceding session after this

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,860
one so I recommend it if you like this

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,200
session you'll probably like the next

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,880
one even better which means if you don't

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,050
like this section you should stay for

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,650
the next one because it might be what

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,360
you really wanted and then there's a

00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,680
lunch break which I'm sure everyone

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,230
likes that doesn't happen in this room

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,460
and there's a bunch of additional

00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,110
educational stuff so I just wanted to

00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,870
flag that in case this is your flavor

00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,200
you might want to track this room pretty

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:06,830
closely okay so I'll introduce myself

00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,870
really quickly I am Laura Noreen I was

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,420
recently at NYU's Center for data

00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,130
science where I was a postdoc and I just

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,860
recently moved to California to take a

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,960
job at a cybersecurity startup where I'm

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,310
still doing research on data science

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,310
ethics which is what I was doing before

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,950
and along the ethical peace I started

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,409
looking at career paths for people so

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,550
I'm sort of foreshadowing something

00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,170
that's going to come up in this talk

00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,200
about sustainable career paths for

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,760
postdocs but I didn't necessarily intend

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,450
to be the poster child for that but now

00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,670
I kind of am so and then my co-author is

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,320
anthony suine who was also a postdoc

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,159
while we were writing this but has since

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,260
gotten a permanent position at berkeley

00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,430
but he couldn't join us today so shout

00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,350
out to Anthony but he's not here always

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,330
good to thank our sponsors so the more

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,670
Sloan data science environment that's

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,010
how an C and I met and they funded a

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,470
grant that went to NYU UC Berkeley and

00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,869
u-dub Seattle to study how data science

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:09,619
was intersecting with higher education

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:11,420
and I also have to thank the team

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,799
Jupiter cuz lots and lots of the stuff

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,269
that I'm going to talk about is

00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,230
something that they've developed

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,269
problems that they

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,129
flag and then decided to solve which is

00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:22,010
super awesome we should all be thankful

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,620
okay so the challenge that we are

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,760
looking for is how can we teach all the

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,860
students who want to learn computer

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,560
science statistics data science that in

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,849
a way that's pedagogically compelling

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,019
that's a good runway for the work that

00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:36,620
these students are going to do in their

00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,610
future

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,099
that's reproducible that's scalable to

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:47,209
large classes and small classes that's

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,860
affordable cloud credits are either free

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,900
if you're lucky or very expensive if

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,540
you're not and that doesn't burn out the

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,549
instructors which if you've done this

00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:00,859
before you maybe understand where I'm

00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:02,299
coming from so the the team so I'm sure

00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:04,400
everyone in this room is familiar with

00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,690
Jupiter notebooks and one of the pain

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,980
points with Jupiter notebooks when

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,989
you're trying to use them in a classroom

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,239
environment it's just getting them set

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,799
up in the first place everyone's using a

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,170
different operating system different

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,019
computers if you go student by student

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,549
it can be relatively painful to get them

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,139
all in exactly the same place at exactly

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,549
the same moment and it's a lot of

00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,609
instructor time so if you use the

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:27,799
Jupiter hub you can kind of prove it end

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:30,319
up providing a more unified environment

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,510
which is nice for sort of pushing out

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,970
assignments doing grading work shutting

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,349
down notebook contributions when you

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,190
want to start grading and those kinds of

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:42,230
things so the way this works is I'm not

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,819
gonna get too deep into infrastructural

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,709
details because we're mostly working on

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:49,489
the political infrastructure in this

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,739
talk but you start with a to get a

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,319
multi-user hub you have a configurable

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,690
HTTP proxy and then you set up a whole

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,760
bunch of single user Jupiter notebook

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,370
instances on that proxy so that you can

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,590
get a unified environment so that's

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,720
essentially what you end up with the hub

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,970
launches this proxy and the proxy

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,700
forwards all requests to the hub so that

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,250
you can have deal with user

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,900
authentication like I said push out

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,849
assignments grade assignments shut

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,760
things down kind of monitor what's

00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:22,070
happening a little bit but it's a little

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,140
challenging to set this up it's scale so

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,550
there is documentation to set up zero to

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,900
Jupiter hub if you really

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,140
want to try this and you haven't done it

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:37,280
before that documentation exists it's

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,270
still fairly if you're really new to

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,310
this it will still be a little

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,850
challenging to use that documentation to

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:48,680
do it

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:50,390
so so good luck the long version yes if

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,010
you can get this set up it's really

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,510
really good for teaching because it

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,270
gives you that unified environment but

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,670
it has taken quite a bit of postdoc and

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,680
faculty labor to get it to work so we're

00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:03,680
trying to figure out how we can help

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,700
that kind of environment scale across

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,770
universities that may not have the I

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,440
don't know volunteer spirit that some

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:16,400
schools do or the funding funding would

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,720
be nice it's in short supply so just to

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,090
give you a little background on why we

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,920
need this the demand for computer

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,520
science data science statistics

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,080
teaching is huge and growing the

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,280
students really really want this they've

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,630
all been told that they're supposed to

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,150
study stem and it's going to get them

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,530
good jobs we're certainly trying to

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,310
encourage more women to go into these

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,960
fields and to some degree it's working

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,550
but we can't really hire faculty fast

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,430
enough to keep up with this demand so

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,750
the class sizes are getting pretty large

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,800
and so that's part of the part of the

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,680
problem and the other part of the

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,300
problem is not only can can we have

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,520
where we struggle to hire faculty

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,140
because they're being I don't know hired

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,060
by cyber security startups in California

00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,370
so someone someone else is hiring them

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,980
we also just see that universities don't

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,660
have their funding for computer science

00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,460
lines is not expanding as fast as the

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,170
demand for these classes so we're kind

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,000
of at a crunch point so if you use the

00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,400
jupiter's hub you can scale to hit a

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,250
class of that size which is a pretty

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,050
large class just to take an example UC

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,360
Berkeley when they introduced their data

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,950
eight class that class now has over a

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,990
thousand students who are trying to

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,790
enroll for that so that's a very that's

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,640
a I mean we call them super-sized

00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:34,190
classes at NYU and they hit 300 so

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,620
thousand is like a super super super

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,330
sized class and it's difficult to manage

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,980
so you really don't have the faculty

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,330
time to go student by student and make

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,199
sure that they've got the infrastructure

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,090
set up and they

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,789
have all the updates and if they get a

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,050
new laptop they're not somehow drowning

00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,310
halfway through the semester because I

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,870
can't really remember how to install

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,340
everything so what I'm going to present

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,469
is a bunch of case studies that were

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,289
based on qualitative interviews with

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:03,860
schools kind of across the range of like

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:06,169
funding support class size private

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,840
liberal arts schools big public schools

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,400
to try to come up with you know like

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,669
what what's happening out there and how

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,770
can Jupiter the Jupiter team and maybe

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,800
some other folks like you know it's on

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,020
Web Services or Google Cloud start to

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,900
support this kind of educational

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,580
initiative so we'll just jump right into

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,740
Berkeley I think everyone's familiar

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,539
with the idea that Jupiter is kind of

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,060
born at Berkeley and Berkeley does

00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:33,199
continue to do a lot of the

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,879
infrastructure development for the

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,830
software although it has now expanded

00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,490
greatly which is why so many people are

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,110
in this room and at this conference so

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,360
their infrastructure and support team

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,729
they have to chain your professors who

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,879
are hands-on doing development work and

00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,229
also managing the team of one full-time

00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,419
staff member who is here at this

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,610
conference ten postdocs and a bunch of

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,979
grad students who are very competent and

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,969
very dedicated and there's a nice kind

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,870
of momentum and inertia at that school

00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,669
supporting this kind of thing there's a

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,490
big team working on it and it's a known

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,599
entity and people to some degree get a

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,860
little bit rewarded for working on this

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,689
in terms of maybe having some

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,399
opportunity to become that one full time

00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:18,139
staff person or get a half line on a

00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,009
grant or something like that their

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:23,659
classes are huge so they have a thousand

00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,270
students in the actual class and then

00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:30,560
they also support an EDX class which is

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,269
even bigger by an order of magnitude so

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,180
they work pretty closely with their IT

00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:37,399
staff which is kind of unique to handle

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,130
the installations for these for a large

00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,169
class that's like a thousand students or

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,660
for the EDX class that's ten thousand

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,760
that's huge and they're unique in that

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,800
way but it means that they run into the

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,940
problems of scale really quickly which

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,190
is good for the rest of us who are

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,740
trying to use these techniques and they

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,850
pay for it partly you know if you're

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Berkeley and you're close

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,110
to the west coast and you're really

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,500
high-profile you can get donations of

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,360
cloud credits so that is also unique for

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,740
them so it's great that they're seeing

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,630
these problems and trying to build out

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,190
infrastructure for everyone else who's

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,610
going to reach that kind of scale or

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,230
even 1/2 or 1/3 of that scale but they

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,870
have some benefits that not all schools

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,490
have like they can attract the attention

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,949
of Google cloud and say hey we need some

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,259
more cloud credits could you give us the

00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:25,699
school directly a bunch of cloud credits

00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:27,860
because what I think a lot of professors

00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,300
are running into is their students might

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,040
be able to individually get some free

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,540
cloud credits but it's really hard to

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,250
use those to set up a hub because you

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,470
can't aggregate them and you're not

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,269
expecting like your freshman or

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,279
something like that to please set up a

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,750
Jupiter I know you don't know how to do

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,769
much of anything but if you could please

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,620
set up a Jupiter how would that be

00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:47,089
awesome so the challenge is there but

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,730
they are facing challenges right this is

00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,110
not like an ideal situation the graduate

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,389
school students in postdocs who are

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,310
working on this program that's a fairly

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,899
precarious way to run this kind of

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,759
situation unless the grants are

00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,000
dedicated to supporting Jupiter which

00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,949
they're generally not that doesn't like

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,240
that may not last forever and these

00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:06,560
folks are not necessarily getting

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,329
rewarded for doing this kind of work

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,430
this does not necessarily get them a

00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:12,889
tenure-track position and if that's what

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,259
it takes to continue to do this kind of

00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:19,160
work then this is this is this is not

00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:20,930
ideal and the bay area is super

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,649
expensive and a lot of them are facing

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,269
some pretty significant financial

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,240
problems because they can't really

00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,649
afford housing in the Bay Area and

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,269
Berkeley just recently decided that

00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:36,319
postdocs are not students and booted

00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:37,880
them out of student housing so ouch we

00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:39,199
were never considered students that we

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,750
never had student housing but at

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:44,480
Berkeley they did and then there are

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,459
also just infrastructure problems if

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,829
you're relying on free crowd credits

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,620
that's also kind of precarious when is

00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,939
Google or Amazon or Microsoft going to

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,649
decide that they want to turn off the

00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:56,600
spigot on those and then if you've based

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,579
your entire infrastructure on getting

00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,870
those free cloud credits you probably

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:03,980
don't have it in your budget to suddenly

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,870
start paying for them and even if maybe

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,370
they never turn off the spigot for a UC

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,120
Berkeley what about schools that can't

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,089
get that or get it once and can

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,770
again it just doesn't scale and even if

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,990
Berkeley say maybe has some extra cloud

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:19,589
credits it is very difficult to share

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:23,070
them they open-source is great but when

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:27,540
it meets up with for-profit logic it

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,460
tends to be difficult translation so the

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,970
next case is a very much more typical

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,350
case talk to someone who well several

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,320
people who work at small liberal arts

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,970
universities and their class sizes are

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,040
much smaller and so it's usually a

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,990
professor says hey I'd like to set up a

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,120
Jupiter hub this is the this is the

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,520
latest and greatest now let me get going

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,240
on this my classes are much smaller it's

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,190
only like 20 or 30 students how do they

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,930
handle installations it's usually a

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,360
struggle they don't tend to have quite

00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,130
such a close relationship with IT staff

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,410
in part because IT staff are pretty

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,360
stretched so they're not necessarily

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,480
they don't have the bandwidth to always

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,510
dedicate time to a specific class and

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,610
they also don't necessarily as most of

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,279
us don't have specific money in

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,350
educational budgets to support paying

00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,890
for a bunch of cloud credits so money is

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,360
an issue and time is an issue and again

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,800
when the cloud providers just give the

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,170
credits to students that doesn't really

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,120
work for this Jupiter hub setup so from

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,560
a career perspective this ulf mostly

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,930
files on professors who don't even have

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,180
postdocs to rely on or grad students of

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,550
any kind so it kind of puts them in a

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,850
crunch and again like this type of thing

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,800
isn't super like usually you can't bring

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,560
to your tenure committee hey I set up a

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,020
Jupiter hub please give me tenure that

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,480
is not that's not a thing

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,390
so that's that's there's a black of

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,410
incentive there at least at the formal

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,430
recognition level and there are some

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,140
sustainability issues if you have to

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,740
continue to do this kind of thing over

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,400
and over again

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,529
the burnout factor is pretty high what

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,640
if you are the ideal situation let's say

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,470
you're at a big wealthy private

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,750
university you have money you have more

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,310
IT staff what does that look like so I

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,160
won't say who we talk to but we talked

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,020
to someone who was in exactly that

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,030
situation I talked to someone on the IT

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,560
staff and they said yeah yeah I had time

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,900
you know not tons of time but I had time

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,300
setup specifically to deal with setting

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,910
up a Jupiter hub I had a budget that I

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,030
could spend so we were able to hire a

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,710
firm to go on to AWS and just set up our

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,320
Jupiter hub so I didn't really have to

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,580
completely deal with that he wasn't

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,840
thrilled with the way that they set it

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,850
up though so he ended up going in so the

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,840
the university in this case covers all

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:53,320
the cost from the general funds nice

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,880
rare but nice and they ended up they

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,400
didn't love the way that the person had

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,710
set up the outside contractors set it up

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,200
because it was too expensive so they

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,760
made some switches in the way that they

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,680
run the instances to make it a little

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,110
bit cheaper and if you happen to want

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,160
links to figure out what is the best

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:14,170
strategy for you that particular person

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,600
has a github repo with all the

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,550
installation code and a little a little

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,560
mathematical formula so you can put in

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,120
how many instances do you have and how

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,940
much would it cost if you set it up in

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,620
one way versus another way and then also

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,020
all the instructions to set it up in his

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,900
alternative way which is using ec2

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,060
instances so if you're interested in

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,910
that that's up there it still is a

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,830
little bit pricey because it is I mean

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,300
they did not have donated cloud credits

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,630
because they didn't have to worry about

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,310
that they just paid for them it's an

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,930
option so if you don't have them and you

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,530
want to know how much it costs that

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:53,170
github repo is actually pretty useful so

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:56,080
they went so for it just to give you a

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,580
sense - and the max costs could be

00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,770
something like seven hundred seventeen

00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,140
dollars a month for 20 users that can be

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,000
brought down to 34 which is much more

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,350
manageable but that's kind of cost

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,200
structure you're looking at on a monthly

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:13,660
basis for like a typical 20 ish student

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:15,700
class so their problem is their model it

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,200
might be functional for them and it is

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,150
and they're gonna scale that out to a

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,610
bunch of other classes and again

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,800
dedicate their IT staff time and hire on

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,150
consultants as needed but that just

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,740
doesn't work for most schools worried

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,960
they don't have that kind of budget so

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,300
the ideal scenario we can learn a few

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,130
things from it because they did you know

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,730
beautifully contribute to the knowledge

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:39,160
on how much this costs

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,500
but they they also haven't quite figured

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,899
out if that particular setup is going to

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,820
work as their classes get larger but

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,470
again it's a big private wealthy

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,510
universities so their classes are going

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,779
to be pretty small they're probably not

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:56,829
gonna have a 1000 cars in class that's

00:15:52,779 --> 00:16:00,910
just outside of their model so the final

00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:02,260
model well sort of yeah is this Canadian

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:07,000
model I don't know if we have the

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:09,519
Canadians in the house hi so we like

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,920
this model a lot and I'm sure you guys

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,079
would probably explain in greater detail

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,360
than I will but the their model is that

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,339
they they have a network that is sort of

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,320
Canada wide and it supports about 10-ish

00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:22,930
universities this may have changed since

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,630
we spoke and they have one full-time

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,820
person who does sysadmin work which is

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,199
great I feel like that person was

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,060
stretched a little bit thin but at least

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,470
it is functioning and then they also

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,209
have kind of a time donation from

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,740
professors at ten different institutions

00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,990
so it's not like that one person

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,550
completely negates the need for other

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:44,740
people to help their classes are can be

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,120
up to two 200 to 300 students but

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,829
they're not necessarily bigger than that

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,459
and they may have some scale issues if

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:53,980
they start to get Berkeley sized classes

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:57,220
or even five hundred students at once

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,320
hitting these servers so they're able to

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,459
work with compute Canada which is a

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:07,449
national infrastructure that the United

00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:09,370
States doesn't quite have and they did

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,079
you know just like all these other

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,870
schools they bootstrapped a lot of this

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:17,829
off staff time and an enthusiasm for the

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,089
project so they are able to get grants I

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,980
mean it's easier when you have a

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,880
national network set up to get grants

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,309
from national and province level actors

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,230
and they also you know they do still run

00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:30,790
on a lot of goodwill and volunteer time

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,679
so I'm not trying to suggest that Canada

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,390
is somehow paying everyone for every

00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,250
minute and the United States is

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,210
expecting all volunteer time it's not

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,880
quite that simple

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:44,530
but they do have some paid staff who

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:47,020
kind of keep the coordination going so

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,760
they still are relying on quite a bit of

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,110
on donated time

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,820
but they're a little bit more rewarded

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,260
for this work than maybe some of the

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,060
folks in the United States especially

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,300
that postdocs who are not sure where

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,510
they're going to work next they may have

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,640
some scalability issues but it is highly

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,980
this might be a more replicable model

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,590
than say the super-wealthy University so

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,410
yeah they they have a funding hurdle not

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,060
a wall they are also able to scale out

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,580
to high school because it's a national

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,680
model not a university based situation

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,840
which is pretty exciting for those of us

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,390
who are trying to build that pipeline

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,280
back a little farther than freshman year

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,160
and their teachers are having a little

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,780
more time to focus on course development

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,080
and get those course modules shared in a

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,840
network so what do we recommend one

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,400
thing that has come up after we really

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,260
took a hard look at that liberal arts

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,530
case where you're having classes that

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,940
are like 20 to 30 students could there

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,730
be another way to do this that's not

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:52,540
quite so complicated as supporting a

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:55,600
1,000 person class yes so there is now a

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:58,450
new package that UV has put together

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,190
called the littlest Jupiter hub so if

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,410
you're in the situation where you just

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,900
have a small class and you don't really

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,660
want to have to deal with setting up

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,760
kubernetes there there is a new set of

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,410
instruction set of Doc's out there to

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,150
support that kind of thing and this is

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,350
definitely something we recommend for

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,790
the smaller classes because you won't

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:20,170
have to wait for some of this more

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:23,280
complicated work that goes into setting

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:26,050
up a national or regional hub system so

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,640
this works for lots of cases where you

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,780
have less than 50 students I wouldn't

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,670
necessarily recommend it for more than

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,880
that it doesn't scale bigger than that

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:38,080
and if you happen to have a very

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,570
motivated either professor who has a lot

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,400
of infrastructure available or IT staff

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,840
you can run this without having to deal

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,540
with the cloud credits if you're willing

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,190
to set it up on your own server which is

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,200
you know it's complicated but the docs

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,550
are out there to lead you through that

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,190
so if you don't want to deal with the

00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,650
Amazon googles and Microsoft's of the

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:59,050
world or pay for that stuff this is one

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,390
way to get around that but it does take

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,110
a lot of my art sorry it takes a lot of

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,710
time

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,030
and expertise but the the next version

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,400
is what if you're not that what if you

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,840
want to do scale and you can't do it or

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,530
you really don't want to have to try to

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,240
set up your own server you can we're

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,090
promoting the idea we're trying to find

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,250
in support for setting up a federated

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,590
model a little more like Canada but not

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,720
necessarily synonymous with Canada's

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:28,570
model because United States has many

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,549
more schools in Canada as so a regional

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,559
like their network supports maybe 10 ish

00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:33,880
15 inch schools we have many more than

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,240
that so it doesn't really work to be

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,179
completely synonymous but we think that

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,799
if you set up this this network it

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:46,030
alleviates a lot of the pain points with

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:48,160
setting up the infrastructure and it

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,950
partially centralizes the collection of

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,360
cloud credits so if we did want to say

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,030
approach someone like an Amazon Web

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,080
Services or a Google cloud those kinds

00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,520
of entities would be much more

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,320
interested in having a conversation

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,080
where they're only distributing credits

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,150
to a small number of players rather than

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,100
one school after the next each at a time

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,660
that doesn't really scale for them

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,220
because it's too many relationships to

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,630
manage but if there were kind of a

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,090
collection and distribution system that

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,820
was not run by them but run by some

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,980
third party that would be more feasible

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,190
so that's one of the reasons we like

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,720
this and it also can help you know

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,600
besides getting the infrastructure set

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,250
up once there are teaching modules ready

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,240
to go from different schools those

00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,220
things can be shared through this

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,040
network too and we're not the only ones

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,510
thinking about that the Journal of open

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,980
source education is already kind of

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,780
doing some of that so if you want to be

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,860
using Jupiter notebooks in your classes

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,100
and you want to know what's out there

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,600
there is already a journal out there we

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,790
have people in this room who are working

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,440
on that so there's a link in the class

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,390
and the slides that I uploaded to all

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,880
these things including that journal so

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,320
and if you want a pulp if you are really

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,750
into teaching and you want to get credit

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,700
for the stuff you've done you can

00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,710
publish it to the journal of open source

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,500
education and then that's a citation you

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,360
can get so we've set up to to work with

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,230
those incentives that are big academic

00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,970
incentives so what would this look like

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,190
so there already is the National Science

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,080
Foundation has set up the big data

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,000
innovation hubs and spokes and some of

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,520
those

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
since folks are already trying to work

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,740
on this so theoretically this system

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,510
already covers every school in the

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:29,040
United States so there's already a

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:30,720
network out there it's easier for the

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,690
cloud companies to donate into that

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,290
network probably than to just go school

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:39,570
by school but there are some cons so

00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:42,690
there's staff support and the big data

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:46,050
hubs is pretty limited right now it's

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,280
really tough for like there's I don't

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,890
know maybe about a total of ten

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,730
full-time people for the entire country

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,640
and they have to do many other things

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:57,090
besides just around Jupiter hubs so at

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,280
the moment that network exists but isn't

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,200
doesn't have the staff capacity to layer

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,300
on this additional challenge but we

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,130
could you know we should probably take

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,750
advantage of the communications

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:10,350
infrastructure we already have so that's

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:13,770
one ongoing there we go

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,300
ongoing idea the other idea is people

00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,970
have suggested well hey we already have

00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,640
state university systems you know the

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:25,140
University of California is a system we

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,050
could you know feder a bit the problem

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,250
with that is that there's still 50 of

00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:34,340
them pros when we states might be able

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:37,080
to better collect state based grants

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:42,150
possibly some private foundation grants

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,710
or local local high net worth people who

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,910
are really interested in education of

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,770
which there are actually quite a few

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,380
might be more interested in donating

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:53,730
directly to the state than to some

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:56,040
larger federal ish entity but if you go

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,900
this route it does kind of leave out

00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,020
weaker state states that are never gonna

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,180
do this we can all think of some I'm not

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,520
going to say what those states might be

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,410
or private colleges like how do they get

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,210
in this network if this is run by the

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,580
state the NSF big data hubs and spokes

00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,040
are much more agnostic about who's doing

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,780
what so those are the two ideas that

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,340
we're really pursuing right now this is

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,400
still kind of a work in progress we

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,050
haven't quite figured it out just to

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,360
remind you like why would we do this at

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,670
all there is a national imperative to

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,590
just increase the scope and the quality

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,480
and the rigor of stem

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,710
education at scale so we're really

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,650
trying to help figure out what that

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,029
looks like and keep it high-quality keep

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,039
those keep what students are learning

00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:40,320
right exactly in line with what they're

00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:41,909
going to be using as I continue to do

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,980
research in graduate school or if they

00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:49,770
leave academia what they're doing in

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:51,539
their jobs if you get these this kind of

00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:53,640
steady IT support and cloud credits you

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:56,010
can scale it to small institutions which

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,299
were particularly interested in they

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:02,279
tend to be the ones that get forgotten

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:03,990
or kind of react later and right now

00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,210
those schools a lot of times just end up

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,770
calling Berkeley and trying to get IT

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,159
support from Berkeley and that just

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:14,070
doesn't work it's very it's very

00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,450
beautiful to watch how much time the

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,390
postdocs and the grad students try to

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,190
put in to help those help those folks

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,600
who are who are really passionate about

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,409
getting this set up but it just doesn't

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,090
work and we really need to continue

00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:28,940
thinking about the larger problem of

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,260
postdoc and grad student labor

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,600
especially like it's obvious that

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,460
everyone here cares deeply about

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,529
education but if education isn't what's

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,690
going to get these folks a job they kind

00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:41,010
of fall at the end of a pipeline where

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,480
they've been supporting this

00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,460
infrastructure building this stuff and

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,899
then they don't have jobs to go to that

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,090
where they can continue to work on that

00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:51,570
like don't feel bad for me I have a

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,980
great job but is unlikely that I'm going

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,830
to be able to really continue working on

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,690
much educational support I can do lots

00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,860
of research but education is really

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,929
something that happens within

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,330
universities and if we lose those

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,980
postdocs we lose all the all of the work

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,559
that all the work they've done the work

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,630
remains but you lose all their their

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,700
embodied knowledge and all their passion

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,159
to industry I think we're trying to

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,690
prevent some of that so I promised that

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,610
I would leave time for questions and

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,559
also you probably are sick of hearing

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,529
anyone speak after 30 minutes or at

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:26,100
least sick of hearing me so I'm happy to

00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:27,840
take questions or even hear from other

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,460
people in the audience I know I see

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,669
familiar faces who have been working on

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:36,270
some of these challenges as well so yeah

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:40,520
what what questions do you have thoughts

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,520
about this do you think it's realistic

00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:48,950
[Applause]

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,460
how many how many of you are getting

00:26:51,639 --> 00:27:01,570
cloud credits from donated from one of

00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:03,399
the the one of the big three so like

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,960
four ish how many of you haven't really

00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:07,049
set this up yet so that's an irrelevant

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,049
question

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,730
okay slightly more so all of all of you

00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:14,529
who didn't raise your hands are doing

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,000
this in some other way which is super

00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:22,379
creative and I'm curious what that looks

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,379
like yeah yes yeah how are you doing it

00:27:53,009 --> 00:28:00,750
we just don't know how many how many

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,750
people are doing that type of thing

00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:08,940
so you are unique yeah so the pro tip

00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:12,100
try that does anyone else have a

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:28,289
workaround for this I don't work around

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:28,289
might be yeah how big are your classes

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,930
do you see any any problems as you scale

00:28:40,600 --> 00:29:03,910
up to sixty years still works pretty

00:28:42,930 --> 00:29:05,800
pretty well does anyone else have

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:29,320
workarounds I want to share in the back

00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:31,770
I haven't they haven't come up in any of

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,640
the interviews although we were

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,850
interviewing people who specifically

00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,920
were having trouble with Jupiter hubs so

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,050
that might have come up but it's it's a

00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,520
bit of a sampling bias that we were are

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:49,290
talking to people who were trying to use

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:49,290
Jupiter hubs does anyone else use that

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,640
[Music]

00:31:12,260 --> 00:32:10,980
experiment in how big how big were the

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:22,740
classes that you're supporting in all

00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:25,260
three of those and how long once you had

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,360
gone to IIT with the evidence that this

00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,530
was a demand how long did it take to get

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,950
all that switched over from your local

00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,950
home

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:54,010
we just went through to get to that week

00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:09,620
in resource-poor for teachers realizing

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:21,170
the potential of having this

00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:29,750
infrastructure this will make you

00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:32,380
realize the benefit for us this is the

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,380
reasons

00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:56,180
so if you were to go that route could

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,530
you bring evidence from some this school

00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,089
and that school and other schools that

00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,470
have used it across disciplines or do

00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:03,160
you have to really have to build it

00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:06,050
within your own in University and then

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:35,510
demonstrate that it's in fact useful

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:37,099
across your specific departments right

00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,260
so like like a bit like a Dean or

00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:40,670
someone can understand if X Y & Z

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,200
schools are seeing that this is useful

00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,680
across chemistry physics digital

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,750
humanities and statistics then probably

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,359
we should think about that but is

00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,220
persuasive to someone in IT do you

00:36:50,359 --> 00:37:01,190
always have to go all the way up to come

00:36:52,220 --> 00:37:07,720
down again or in which case you do have

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:07,720
to go to the Dean level something

00:38:23,560 --> 00:39:22,160
yeah somewhere it shakes me that it is

00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:24,560
typically some disciplines are more able

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,300
to be aware of what might be idle than

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,550
others and trying to navigate your own

00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,500
bureaucracy to figure out like where Wow

00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,510
which exact should I go through

00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,370
libraries should I go through my own

00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,470
school like that in itself is a

00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:38,510
complicated question for lots of people

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,520
and we probably had time for maybe one

00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,280
more comment or question does anyone

00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:51,890
want to volunteer something else that's

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:55,850
working yes I yeah I think we had a

00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,650
similar comment about that so that's

00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,210
that's awesome and I think we have

00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,170
actually come to the end of the time and

00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,420
I want to make sure I give everyone

00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:05,060
enough of a break because I know you

00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:08,270
were all just fed coffee so it's an

00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,870
input-output situation so thank you all

00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,220
for coming

00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,290
feel free to get in touch if you have

00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,240
questions well the Jupiter team will

00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:17,810
continue to help as much as possible and

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,610
we will continue to push for some some

00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,710
kind of model beyond LITTLEST Jupiter

00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,360
hubs that works for the you know at

00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,340
scale a little bit better and can maybe

00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,750
just distribute some cloud credits so if

00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,120
you happen to be lurking in the audience

00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,440
and you have the capacity to UM release

00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,560
some of those cloud credits to a

00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,670
federated model come talk to me looking

00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,460
for you guys the goo

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,200
clouds and measures of the world so

00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:44,239
thanks for coming

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,239
