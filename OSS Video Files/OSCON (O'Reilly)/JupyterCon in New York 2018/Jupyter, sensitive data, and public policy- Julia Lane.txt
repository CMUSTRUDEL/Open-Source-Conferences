	Jupyter, sensitive data, and public policy
Julia Lane (Center for Urban Science and Progress and Wagner School, NYU)

As Lew Platt, CEO of Hewlett Packard, once said, "If only HP knew what HP knows, we would be three times more productive,” pointing to the gap between the value of data and its real-world application. Government agencies have found it difficult to serve taxpayers because of the technical, bureaucratic, and ethical issues associated with access and use of sensitive data.

Julia Lane explains how the Coleridge Initiative has partnered with Jupyter to design ways that can address the core problems such organizations face. These methods are best summarized as ensuring that the five "safes” are addressed—that is, safe people working on safe projects in safe settings can access safe data, and safe outputs are released.
