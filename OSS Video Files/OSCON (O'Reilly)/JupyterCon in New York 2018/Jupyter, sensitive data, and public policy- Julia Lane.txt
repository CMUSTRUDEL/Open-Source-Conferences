Title: Jupyter, sensitive data, and public policy- Julia Lane
Publication date: 2018-09-20

Description: 
	Jupyter, sensitive data, and public policy
Julia Lane (Center for Urban Science and Progress and Wagner School, NYU)

As Lew Platt, CEO of Hewlett Packard, once said, "If only HP knew what HP knows, we would be three times more productive,” pointing to the gap between the value of data and its real-world application. Government agencies have found it difficult to serve taxpayers because of the technical, bureaucratic, and ethical issues associated with access and use of sensitive data.

Julia Lane explains how the Coleridge Initiative has partnered with Jupyter to design ways that can address the core problems such organizations face. These methods are best summarized as ensuring that the five "safes” are addressed—that is, safe people working on safe projects in safe settings can access safe data, and safe outputs are released.

okay so thank you very much I'm

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,890
delighted to be here I should say from

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,840
the get-go

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:16,109
I'm economist by training so I work a

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,300
lot with computer scientists but my

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,140
training is very much in the area of

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,250
working with social science data very

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:30,900
large scale data and so my interaction

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,690
with Brian and Jupiter has come out in

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,640
the context of me working with data in

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,109
order to solve problems and so it's in

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,870
that context I'm going to talk to you

00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,120
about how we use Jupiter today my

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,229
background as I said as an economist I'm

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,940
in Wagner School of Public Policy at New

00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,519
York University I'm in the Provost's

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,139
office as well and I have an appointment

00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:55,769
at the Center for in science and

00:00:52,139 --> 00:01:00,269
progress so looking at a confidential

00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:04,309
Micro data for understanding human

00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:08,369
behavior is basically my background okay

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:14,729
and so you know like I kind of like this

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:18,270
line a lot I am my original training was

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,159
as a statistician and econometrician and

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,229
then I finally figured out that having

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,670
masses amounts of dated massive amounts

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:31,159
of data beat torturing the the equations

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,979
to get to the third standard third point

00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:39,810
to the right of the decimal in terms of

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:43,590
figuring out standard errors and and so

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,689
I I really like I I was told I had to

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:52,439
have this on for the recording is that

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:55,590
right but you know here's the thing that

00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,920
you realize when you've been working

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:07,560
with a lot of sensitive data across

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:09,030
organizations so you know the this is

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,090
certainly true when you're dealing with

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,380
data in the public sector and it's also

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,640
true when you're dealing with data and

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,020
the private sector but I'm

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,600
to talk about it primarily in the

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,740
context of the public sector which is

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:27,150
you know in any organization if you only

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:32,250
knew what everyone knew would be much

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:36,660
more profitable and let me give you two

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,870
concrete examples for this one with how

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,020
I kind of got into this field 20 years

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,350
ago and then one more current and then

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,870
I'll show you how kinda we worked in to

00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:55,380
start working with Brian for my sins so

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:58,050
about 25 years ago I was interested in

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,560
understanding and the and don't go to

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,780
sleep on me when I say this the dynamic

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,209
interrelationship of workers and firms

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,980
so so why did why do we care about this

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,010
well I'm any car I'm a labor economist

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,870
interested in the determinants of

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,140
earnings and employment outcomes of

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,630
workers and I'm also interested in the

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,260
productivity and growth of firms so it

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,540
turns out that you can't answer those

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,750
questions with only looking at a data

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,480
set of workers because in order to

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,950
understand the impact of firms on

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,680
workers you need a data set that's

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,470
representative of workers and in order

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,150
to understand the impact of firm or

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,299
workers on firms you need a

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,920
representative data set of firms and you

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,470
can't have both at the same time because

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,390
most workers work for big firms and most

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,510
firms are small because of the skewness

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,120
of the way in which human activity

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,190
typically takes place so what that meant

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,600
was that I needed universe date on all

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:06,959
workers and all firms in the United

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:09,570
States right so that's why did turns out

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,910
there are two data sets that enable you

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,859
to capture universe state are on on

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,320
firms and workers you clearly can't do

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,970
it in a survey you have to use it using

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,410
administrative records there are two

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,150
sources of those data there's

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:28,080
unemployment insurance wage records

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:31,110
which are records that are fire

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,410
every quarter by every firm in every

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:38,639
state in the u.s. in the cupboard sector

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,639
in for the for every worker they have in

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,860
that quarter and it's got their name

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,270
their SSN and their earnings so it's

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,830
confidential microdata

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,319
right we don't want that stuff floating

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,039
around don't want to put it out an open

00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,190
data format and then the other one is

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,800
our friends at the IRS there's tax data

00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,090
you know if you misuse tax data does

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,960
anyone know what the penalty is for

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,659
title 26 under the US Code 10 years in

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,669
jail and/or three-quarters of a million

00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:13,020
dollar fine so you don't kind of want

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:14,909
that data floating around right so I not

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,039
saw enormous amounts of churning the

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:19,229
value proposition for public policy was

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,940
huge because what you could see you

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:24,210
could see enormous amounts of churn and

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:28,319
the United States way beyond what survey

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,819
data is able to tell you so you know

00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,340
first Friday of every month they come

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,770
out and say X number of new jobs have

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,229
been added in the economy right and

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,039
they'll say something like 160 thousand

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:45,120
new jobs stop for a minute

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,969
is that possible in an economy where

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,650
they don't know 140 million jobs how is

00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,779
it possible that there there's only a

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,449
hundred and sixty thousand new jobs or

00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:57,360
200,000 new jobs well they're looking at

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,710
the net so what you really want to do is

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
you want to look at that dynamic in

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,270
relationship you want to know something

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,009
about who those workers are right so

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,630
what you have to do is you have to match

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,849
those administrative records but you

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,699
only have EAN employer ID number social

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,380
security number name and earnings you

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,580
want to in order to really understand

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,990
what's going on you want to match up

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,279
with something about the characteristics

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,380
of the workers and the characteristics

00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,229
so the firm's so you need data from the

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,520
Social Security Administration on that

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,659
they are going to link by Social

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,990
Security number and you were going to

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:29,909
want data on the characteristics of the

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,110
businesses for the Census Bureau and

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,740
something about the households which

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,509
were at the Census Bureau so right so we

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,910
did that

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:42,150
it was a non-trivial activity

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,130
and we built the le HD program at the US

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,030
Census Bureau and it turns out that's

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,680
the it created a whole new frame for

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,330
understanding the US economy because

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,910
instead of looking at just work or in

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,110
addition to I should say looking at just

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,960
at workers and at firms what we had was

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,460
a whole new frame which was called jobs

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,380
okay and you couldn't even track them

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,500
either by firms because you've got the

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,290
ein linked over time and the SSM linked

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,850
over time but there were massive

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,800
confidentiality issues because they

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,870
didn't want to go to jail right and I

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,370
don't have 3/4 of a million dollars they

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,050
could just right over to the federal

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,570
government so there's lots of

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,880
confidentiality issues that you have to

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,680
address for legal reasons for ethical

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,720
reasons for professional reasons for all

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,290
of that kind of for all of that kind of

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,080
those kind of reasons so you know that's

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,180
it needs a massive vial so even back I

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,280
was doing this in the late 90s that took

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,720
good seven years to get this program up

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,220
and running it's still running it's the

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,570
first and to my knowledge still the only

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,180
national statistical program that was

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,470
started by a researcher it's got 12

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,910
million dollars in appropriated

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,490
congressional fund and it's a major

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,620
activity now at the Census Bureau

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,540
massive amount of data it was for the

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,420
state of California for example would

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,010
they be shipping us a terabyte of data

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,170
every quarter and even though the Census

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:09,360
Bureau's used the big data sets and kind

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:13,530
of gum up the old works right so so that

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,990
was an example where for pennies because

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,400
it only costs under a penny to process

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,170
one of those records where it costs

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,270
about between a thousand and fifteen

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,590
hundred dollars to collect a piece of

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,180
survey data by this time all the

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,350
processing and field interviewing and

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:32,940
cleaning has done so helped the taxpayer

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:34,650
out cost pennies gave us incredible new

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,810
insights into the economy the sloan

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,660
foundation was one of the original

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:43,080
supporters of it and it is now one of

00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:45,200
the most used data sets that certainly

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,520
labor economists use don't believe

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,050
certainly that the inner cephalus own

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,270
foundation and for use so that kind of

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,490
motivates why you want to use these

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,590
confidential Micro data and that was 20

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,930
years ago so let me tell you a shorter

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:06,000
story but why we care about it even now

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,910
so David Ellwood who's some of you may

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,350
know he's at the Kennedy School has this

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,150
great story he was working with the

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,970
Gates Foundation to help improve

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:20,130
mobility from poverty and he's got this

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:25,560
great story about the Commissioner for

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:28,940
health in Baltimore and as she said she

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,830
said every time a kid dies in Baltimore

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:36,660
she says you know all the commissioners

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:41,280
who touch that family like come homeless

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,470
education welfare you know all the

00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,150
different programs that they might have

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,339
touched the government programs we're

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,900
talking about public policy here they

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,990
all get together and they have a file on

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:54,450
the kid that says thick but she said the

00:09:51,990 --> 00:10:01,110
only time we can ever share that data is

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:05,550
when the kid is dead right so how can we

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:08,460
bring together data that means something

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:11,130
and I don't mean to slam computer

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,930
scientists some of them close to being

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:19,470
human beings but you know I don't give a

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,150
damn about three one one taxi rides and

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,620
I don't give a damn about how the bikes

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,960
are written around the country I want to

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,720
figure out how to improve public policy

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,390
on human beings which means that we need

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,200
to figure out how to work with sensor

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:38,630
microdata okay so that creates all kinds

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,740
of problems as you would expect

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:45,240
particularly when we're dealing with

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,950
government data there's limited internal

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,650
capacity to work with the date her if

00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,750
you think about it there aren't the

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,110
resources within federal state and

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,810
particularly local governments of the

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:03,870
workforce it's management by Excel right

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:07,350
trying to link data across agency lines

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,800
very often done by putting together for

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,420
example to business registers in Excel

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,140
and a human being

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,690
matching the rows and another human

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:23,600
being validating it right so that's the

00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:25,770
yes I know it's true it is true yeah

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,410
obviously they're going to worry about

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,480
security there's a lot of legal mandates

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,839
around access and use that you have to

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,850
worry about and there's lots of data

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,560
sharing issues you know people worry

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,110
about the cost they worry about the

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,740
burden quite frankly they worry about

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,120
the data quality right it's it's done

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,600
for the administration of government

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,540
programs not necessarily for the

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,310
analysis again because it's for

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,930
administrative purposes not necessarily

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,240
frano there's good purposes the data

00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,670
documentation of that and they're really

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,720
worried that the analysis that is done

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:06,270
is crap and that and that can really

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,250
create lots of problems so let me give

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,880
you an example I'm not going to mention

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,790
the people who are doing this work but

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,010
using administrative data on schools so

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,279
you've got cohorts of kids coming in to

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,020
a school and what they want to do is

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,279
they want to create indicators of

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,209
whether the schools any good or not

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,760
right so you take a cohort of kids

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:34,110
coming in a ninth grade and then you

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,779
look at the proportion who graduate by

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,070
12th grade and that is one of the

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,260
measures and you just look at the

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:48,150
administrative records so what's the

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:52,260
problem and that students move right and

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:54,180
what kind of students move all kinds

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,440
particularly those damn foreigners right

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,839
we've got a real problem with the

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,680
foreigners that's least that's what my

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,680
mother-in-law says

00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:08,600
my liners she always wanted my husband

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:14,869
to marry a nice st. Louis girl and she

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:16,910
got one out of those three so anyway so

00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:20,869
this is we're working with Jupiter comes

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:23,569
in right so what you really want to do

00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:27,050
is you kind of want to build an

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:28,309
environment in which because the

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,350
problems going to be when you've got

00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,910
sensitive data you're going to have to

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,839
twist yourself into a pretzel to get

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,399
access to the data to work with the data

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,660
it's going to be very difficult to get

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:44,619
the replicability and and to have other

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,629
people and the people within the agency

00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:51,110
understanding what was done so they're

00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:53,420
examples of the bad analysis can be

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,339
corrected and work with before someone

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,569
publishes an article that shows up on

00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:03,410
the front page of the New York Times

00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:05,660
which says school X is lousy because 10%

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,449
of their students graduate right so

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,889
they've got a chance to be part of that

00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:15,889
conversation and so we were actually one

00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:18,860
of the first users I believe of ipython

00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:21,290
notebook back in the day when we first

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:25,749
started building these what I'm going to

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:31,790
talk to you about and I'm what I'm gonna

00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:33,350
spell out a little bit more so the the

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:39,220
context that I'm going to talk to you

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:43,959
about today is a little bit looking

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:49,339
backwards in 2016

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:51,920
patty Murray and Paul Ryan passed an act

00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,480
they actually did something in Congress

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,990
and in March which is called the

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,819
evidence-based policy Commission and

00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,959
what they did was they recognized all

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,579
those problems for pulling

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,720
administrative records together and they

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:06,799
said well what are we going to do about

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,959
it and so they what a shock they formed

00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,149
a commission of 15 people to go and

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,490
figure out what they should do in order

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,390
to in order to address these public

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,820
policy issues

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,710
they gave the Census Bureau with which

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,290
I've been affiliated for a long time a

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,970
chunk of change to build an

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,660
administrative records Clearing House

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,480
and so the basic idea there was let's

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,820
provide a secure environment so agencies

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,400
can put their data in there their

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,620
administrative record so that I could

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,880
put education data and work for state

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,520
her and welfare data together and then

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,020
we could evaluate the public programs so

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,240
that we could deliver data more

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:52,790
efficiently right let me pause there and

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,830
think how many agencies do you think

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,080
would put their data into a

00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:03,370
clearinghouse so that people could

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:03,370
evaluate them at the federal level I

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:11,060
don't think so and in fact that was so

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,920
census turned to me and said can you

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:17,690
build a facility a data facility for the

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,160
purposes of informing the deliberations

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,060
of the Commission and I said well you

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,370
know I actually chaired that the the UK

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,160
had tried to do something like this

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,460
about three or four years earlier called

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,150
the administrative data Research Network

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:38,050
and they had four centers in England

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:41,180
Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland and

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:46,130
guess what they spent 38 million pounds

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,660
50 million dollars and it took them that

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,450
long to figure out what it took you

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,890
about a nanosecond to figure out which

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,590
is that agencies weren't going to put

00:16:51,890 --> 00:17:03,320
their data in right so our question is

00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:06,050
I'm sorry sorry about that so so what

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,150
they did was what we did was we said

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,300
it's not going to work if we just try is

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,650
you could solve the technical solution

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,329
spend fifty million dollars doing it

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,730
that's not what they gave us but you

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,020
know much less than that could solve the

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,910
technical solution but you've got to

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,120
figure out the human solution so what we

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,699
said is having worked with ipython

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,950
notebook and and built classes around

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,920
using data to solve the agents

00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:35,690
problems said what we could do is build

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:39,290
classes that were for the agencies for

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:42,170
agency staff and they could work with

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,480
their own data and the basic idea there

00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,970
is that if they're working with it

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,100
you're building up the capacity you're

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,720
addressing the legal mandates because

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,900
it's people within the agency working

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,310
with it and you if you set it up right

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,920
and this again is where Jupiter

00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,420
notebooks going to come in you can

00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,420
entice them to give you better

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:05,030
documentation and you're going to not

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,190
run that risk of bad analysis so in

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,980
other words you could develop prototype

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,340
things and build up the scout

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:16,580
staff capacity link the data and at

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,700
least get that kind of an ecosystem in

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,410
place so that's what we did and we built

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,360
this thing called an administrative data

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,540
research facility we booked classes

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,370
around it using Jupiter notebook I'm

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,890
going to talk through a little bit about

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:35,510
what we learned and where we're heading

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:38,180
in that process so and what I'm going to

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:41,510
talk about is this project that I'm

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,910
working with Brian and Fernando which is

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,010
being generously funded by Sloan Schmidt

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,780
and over Duke Family Foundation as well

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,290
as Deutsche Bundesbank but they don't

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:53,330
want me to put their logo up there and

00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,690
so basically what we are doing we're

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,660
doing gonna do two things we're going to

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:03,050
build or we have built and secure

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:06,380
platform and that secure platforms got

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:09,530
to worry about five things so if you

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,810
want to make the data safe you know I

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,610
mean you don't want your tax records out

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,590
in the public any more than our fearless

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:20,030
leader does but for probably different

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:23,000
reasons the an is your faith fearless

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:26,750
leader I'm not mine and that was a bit

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,860
of a low blow wasn't it but what you

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,530
want to do is you want to have safe

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,600
people so we call it the five safes this

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:36,260
is kind of standard across statistical

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,970
agencies and internationally so you want

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,250
to have safe people that is people who

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,159
are trusted coming in you want safe

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,080
settings

00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,509
you only access it in a secure

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,940
environment sake project so these are

00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:49,769
going to be approved project and safe

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,169
outputs that is that their disclosure

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,789
reviewed because micro data can be very

00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,470
easily reaiiy dead fine so you want to

00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:57,659
aggregate it up to a level when it's

00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,279
safe and that's what gives you safe data

00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:02,490
and then we're going to build a training

00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,049
programs around that so the project that

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,929
we're working on with Brian and with

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:10,789
Jupiter notebook is how can we automate

00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,789
some of that now how can we kind of

00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:17,220
build Jupiter knoppix to capture some of

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,879
those elements and an automated rather

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,649
than a manual manner okay so so let me

00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:40,590
tell you a little bit about the classes

00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:43,799
which are kind of the so the the so let

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:47,309
me get very specific so here's the basic

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:51,690
idea um what you want to give what you

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:53,850
want to do is you want to build you

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,159
don't want to build it's a bad idea to

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,860
say I'm going to build a clearinghouse

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,279
on all people and all of their

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,490
activities right what you want to do is

00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:10,259
you can you should only build projects

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:12,389
that have documented purpose that is

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:16,169
consistent with the agency mission and

00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:21,990
the only work that is done in them has

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:24,750
to be consistent with what the with what

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:29,100
the agency is legally authorized to do

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:33,139
does that make sense so how do you build

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:38,250
sets of questions and classes that

00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:42,570
address a multiple agency needs so so we

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:46,080
what where we started was we said there

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,970
let's start with an obvious set of

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,710
questions so the obvious that were the

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,330
ones with agencies that were very

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,029
interested in being involved in this

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,690
process so the agencies that were

00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,880
interested

00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:03,540
justise housing Labor and Welfare and

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,920
Corrections I'm sorry so here with the

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,010
question here was the overarching

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:12,360
question that the agencies agreed to it

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:15,480
was what is the impact of neighborhood

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,680
characteristics and access to jobs on

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,110
the earnings and employment outcomes of

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:25,080
welfare recipients and ex-offenders and

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,660
their subsequent recidivism and/or

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,580
retention on welfare so in order to

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,930
answer that question you need to pull

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:36,240
together data from multiple agencies

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:39,360
does that make sense so what you do is

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,780
we built a set of applied data analytics

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,390
classes that trained up people in those

00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:49,470
agencies put them together in teams so

00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:53,190
we had people who were data people from

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,630
q2 people policy people and we put them

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,290
together in teams because you need

00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,940
multiple sets of skills it's not just a

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,070
coding problem it's an analytical

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,570
problem and a policy problem and and

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,110
understanding what the issues are from

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:10,230
and and and let them loose so they're

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,510
from the agencies and they had to figure

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,130
out how to formulate questions how to do

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:18,630
database management that went beyond

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:24,450
Excel how to link data that went beyond

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:27,510
to excel how to do machine learning do

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:31,230
prediction how to do text analysis

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,960
network analysis visualization in front

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:38,460
and privacy and confidentiality and that

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,250
formed the arc of the class attend a

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,680
class set of classes and and we put

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,900
broke it up into modules and that's what

00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,240
I call data science right because it's

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,800
not coding it's a combination of people

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,330
who know how to code we understand the

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,790
problems who understand the data I

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,160
understand the policy all talking

00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:01,140
together which is what makes a team

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:03,500
science so and and now what we're doing

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:08,440
is adding in information about education

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:10,660
so what we're what that generates

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,700
value proposition for the agencies this

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:17,860
staff get trained up the value is new

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,070
products get developed that help them

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,980
serve their mission but requires data

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:27,040
across agency lines they're new networks

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:31,990
across agencies and they've got new

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:36,040
measures of activity okay and pathetic

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:39,790
add for the text book that we generated

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:43,270
as a result as a result of this and you

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:46,120
know consistent with the vision here

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:49,570
it's two computer scientists in foster

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,820
and raid Gani two economists Ron Jarmon

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,320
and me Ron is now the director of the

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,450
st. acting director of the Census Bureau

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,040
in Franco crodo who's a statistician so

00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,780
sounds like a little bit like a rabbi

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,800
and a priest or walked into a bar but

00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:05,740
you know there we are and that was and

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:10,180
that was the structure so what we had to

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:13,330
do we and we had to build this technical

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,250
environment that had all the

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,310
characteristics that I was talking about

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:21,130
so we had to figure out who were our

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:23,220
users and then what are they going to

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,900
want to do and I'm going to talk a lot

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,380
in the time that I have remaining

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,340
about the access discovery in

00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,590
collaboration because that's very much

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,500
core of how the Jupiter notebooks are

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,780
being used so here's the structure of

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:42,100
the environment and here's the structure

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:44,140
of how the training feeds in to all

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,890
those moving parts so basically the idea

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:50,020
here is you want the data user not just

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:55,240
coming in and doing what we call data

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:58,060
rape right it is building an environment

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:02,440
in which their use is consistent with

00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:04,030
the needs and the statutory mission of

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,620
the agency which who are the data

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:10,240
producers and quite often the data

00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:12,820
stewards and try to engage them with

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,570
providing documentation so I know that

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,040
sounds boring

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,100
everyone thinks old metadata

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,800
documentation is so boring but it's

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,130
critical to understanding what's going

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,639
on

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:26,159
you know you

00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:28,570
understand variable b56 underscore seven

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,450
changed from six categories to four

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,700
categories in 2002 what happened what

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,719
what's the difference and the coverage

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:42,369
of issues now I've been involved in data

00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:45,639
for 25 years I have never found anyone

00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:46,690
who does a decent job of data

00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:48,579
documentation

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,459
I mean it's everyone hates it it's

00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:54,009
really lousy and even when people do a

00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:56,889
good job I can't find it because like if

00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:59,379
I'm looking for how many people are

00:26:56,889 --> 00:27:01,589
foreign-born in the United States let's

00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:06,359
say they might have coded it

00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:08,979
non-resident aliens or foreigners or

00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,209
non-native born or whatever they'll be

00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:13,179
like ten different things and I won't

00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:15,879
have thought of what they are so this is

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:18,070
a real challenge and so one of the

00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:21,099
things that we wanted to do and this is

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:24,849
part of this project is how can we

00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:27,459
rather than just creating ontology and

00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:30,329
trying to force human being to use

00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:33,519
ontology x' how can we generate

00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:35,469
documentation out of the use and how can

00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,999
we make jupiter notebooks part of that

00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:41,619
conversation make it part of that

00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:43,929
workflow and so where we headed on this

00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,499
it'll get a little bit more detail in

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,259
just a minute

00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:51,759
was to be inspired by Amazon and

00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:54,459
TripAdvisor right so how many of you

00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:57,459
have used TripAdvisor when you try and

00:27:54,459 --> 00:28:03,039
figure out which hotel to go to right or

00:27:57,459 --> 00:28:07,239
Yelp for the restaurant so you know 20

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,759
years ago you had no clue with what

00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:14,259
anything about what was on the inside of

00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,940
a hotel you knew it was a hotel now what

00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,519
were you know it was a restaurant and

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,369
you knew the name so you knew the user

00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,849
the producer provided metadata

00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,109
documentation you know the name of the

00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:27,909
restaurant and the type of the

00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:30,639
restaurant or whatever or with Amazon

00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:32,289
with a book you have that before Amazon

00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:34,750
you for a book you had the ISBN number

00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:37,750
the name of the publisher and

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,710
title and the author now what's happened

00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:43,990
is that people willingly provide

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,600
metadata documentation about the content

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:50,320
of a book about the content of a hotel

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:54,240
and you know the way they've done it is

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:59,740
they built ways of rewarding people and

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,930
and and giving them kudos for it so part

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:05,530
of what we are trying to do is to build

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:08,590
into the Jupiter into your workflow ways

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:11,980
of people contributing knowledge about

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,930
variable b56 underscore 7 that's part of

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,800
their natural process it's not imposed

00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:20,620
on them from outside okay and then also

00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,620
of providing feedback back to the data

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,210
steward about what the data use has been

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,220
doing through text analysis and other

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,790
types of approaches so that's where

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:34,720
we're heading so what we're building

00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:36,640
then is the security the discovery data

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,040
stewardship collaboration and training

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,310
so both the technical and the human

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,720
engagement pieces so it turns out and

00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:48,390
I'm not going to bore you too much about

00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:52,510
this there's this bear of a program is

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:55,630
the called FedRAMP that enables you to

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,130
define you know how to protect the

00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,680
environment so that's the technical

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,230
solution it takes you old several

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,990
million dollars and lots of blood sweat

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:09,160
and tears to build the key thing here is

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:11,760
it's a secure environment within which

00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:16,090
you cannot reach out to the internet so

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,370
it's remote it's in an AWS cloud but

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:23,050
once you're in you can't cut and paste

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:24,280
it's much safer and you can protect you

00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,010
know the kind of tools that are

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,350
available and so on so that's what we

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,300
built we have sensors authorization to

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:35,260
operate but it's a standardized approach

00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:38,050
that we use now here comes the answer to

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,440
your approach so so so what effectively

00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:44,590
happens and the structure within which

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,020
we're working is what the FedRAMP does

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,770
is it enables us to build this

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,870
administrative rate

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:58,190
data research facility with city walls

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:59,990
so there's some continuous monitoring

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,880
there's like the night watchman that

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,740
checks all the time this pen testing

00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,020
that's goes on and make sure that the

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:09,680
walls are safe and then different

00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:13,570
agencies can build houses inside the

00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:16,850
city walls so they own that and they

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:19,280
make sure that the and what we do is we

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:23,470
provide them an environment in which

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:27,560
they can share data across agency lines

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:31,310
or across state lines which has not been

00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:34,460
able to be done before for approved

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:39,110
people and approved projects in approved

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:41,560
settings with approved disclosure review

00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:45,950
and that's what gives them the safe data

00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:50,000
so their original problem that I pose to

00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:51,560
you where the commissioners in the city

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,310
of Baltimore couldn't share their data

00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,930
well now they can and so the first state

00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:00,070
that we've been working with which goes

00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:02,840
back to historical reasons with Illinois

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:06,290
Department of Human Services Secretary

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,670
was saying the other day to the director

00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,350
of Corrections he said you know

00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:13,780
governor's office called me the other

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:17,180
day in the morning and said how many

00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:21,530
child care providers have criminal

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:22,820
correct convictions he said before I

00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,620
wouldn't have been able to answer that

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,770
question because that would have

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:30,230
involved data across agency lines so I

00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:32,990
wouldn't have no one if there was an axe

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:36,380
murderer who was taking care of the

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,810
state's at-risk children he said what I

00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:42,470
was able to do because of the ad RF and

00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:45,320
because he had trained staff who'd been

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,430
trained through our program I could just

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:52,220
call down and they could use the Jupiter

00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:56,450
notebooks that have been built to link

00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:58,100
these data across agency lines and they

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,280
were able to run it and in the afternoon

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,520
I had an answer and the answer was six

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,100
not that not X meters but

00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,830
convicted criminals I don't think they

00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,870
had dater on this one thing we noticed

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,730
though and going back to the metadata

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,880
documentation one thing that we noticed

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,650
very much was that when they people land

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,130
on a data set there's almost no

00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:23,280
information about what those data have

00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,810
been used for and no information about

00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,690
what the results been what the code is

00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:29,190
and so on it's it's you know they look

00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,960
they'll ask me because I've been working

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,210
with you I wage records for a long time

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,970
who else has worked on that and I go oh

00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:39,450
well so-and-so interns don't so that's a

00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:44,580
hell of a way to run a science right so

00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:46,800
how can we get the knowledge about who's

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,480
worked on it and what so how do we build

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,770
the state of discovery so we went and

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,250
talked to people who know something

00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:56,430
about encouraging people to engage so we

00:33:53,250 --> 00:34:00,870
went to talk to the NYU game lab so they

00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:04,230
do a lot of these figure out how

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:06,030
Wikipedia works how War World War works

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,560
and all of these kinds of more worlds

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:10,560
whatever it is I think the kids are

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,880
playing it all the time and so they said

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,220
you know here's the problem you've got a

00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,890
large database that researchers and

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,440
lawmakers have to access but it's

00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:21,000
difficult to pass and users are not

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,600
encouraged to interact with or

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,190
contribute to data right so what they

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,860
want to do is they want to establish

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:31,890
rich context so they went out and looked

00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:35,159
at things that are worked and you know

00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:37,110
what computer scientists do share code

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:41,010
do share information and they get little

00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:43,140
badges contributions followers shows how

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:46,620
much the users and I've sat on a bunch

00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:49,500
of NSF computer science panels and a lot

00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:53,929
of you guys as you put it on your CDs

00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:57,240
right so we could create an

00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:59,400
infrastructure that that says you know

00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,460
you guys are good guys that's just like

00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,410
the TripAdvisor as well and then that's

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,520
going to enable people to do search and

00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:10,860
discovery collaboration that's really

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,860
been facilitated through the Jupiter

00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,960
notebooks and other tools and let me

00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,700
show exactly how that works

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,300
so here we have someone in the class

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:24,540
working on Corrections data and she says

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,839
hey guys so I think she was with

00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,980
Employment Security and she says hey

00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:35,780
Corrections data gurus

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:37,950
how can this result hold and the CIO of

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:41,430
Corrections who's working also in the

00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:43,740
class says it's really bad data you know

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,680
they could have spent forever working

00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,450
with that data and tried to beat on it

00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,390
but because they're working together in

00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,309
a trusted environment they're sharing

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,190
that knowledge and then someone else

00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:58,140
comes in and says here's some code

00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,240
that's helpful and shares that and

00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,730
here's some house that comes in and says

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,319
here's some other useful code and then

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,480
here's someone else who comes in and

00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:08,550
says by the way we're looking at welfare

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,849
recipients see here's some useful

00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:14,730
articles that can form part of that rich

00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:17,569
context so that's precisely where we're

00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:21,930
heading so the notion here with this

00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:24,540
project the standard project is capture

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:27,089
data from text and from class

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,309
interactions so that as you're going on

00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:32,250
just a notebook as you land on a data

00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:34,799
set - you're right comes up you know

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,450
just like Amazon here are other people

00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,819
like you who've been working with this

00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:41,040
data here are some of the results here's

00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:43,920
some of the code and on the left hand

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,630
side by the way would you like to

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,990
contribute just a couple of lines of

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:51,780
code right or tell us a little bit about

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:54,680
this data set so by being made part of

00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,650
the work flow induce that metadata

00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:02,510
documentation out does that make sense

00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:05,400
and so in conjunction with icpsr and

00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,319
nature in other places were actually

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,530
running a competition we'd love you to

00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:14,040
help with that so come up and ask me

00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:17,490
afterwards and we'd love to get those of

00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,010
you who had text gurus to help us think

00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:24,059
through how to launch this which will be

00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:26,960
launched September 4th and basically the

00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:29,240
idea is is within the secure environment

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,680
to build that

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:37,230
rich context as they're working through

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,210
the different data set so that's I was

00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,480
told to shut up and I'm the very

00:37:39,210 --> 00:38:09,960
obedient person but don't tell my

00:37:42,480 --> 00:38:13,080
husband yes if you give me your card

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,210
we're not launching until September 4th

00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,700
so we're busily uploading the

00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:22,440
necessarily files it'll be a college

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,910
initiative dot org slash rich context

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,250
competition I think they'll give me your

00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,380
card because we're not actually

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:31,260
launching it till the day after Labor

00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:38,630
Day but your help would be greatly

00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:41,370
appreciated I sent everyone to sleep

00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,440
okay why anyway I hope I've convinced

00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:46,740
you that this to keep an eye out for

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,750
what we're up to next and go forth and

00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:55,570
enjoy your other meetings thank you

00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,570
