Title: JupyterLab and Plotly: A data visualization power couple- Lindsay Richman (McKinsey & Co.)
Publication date: 2018-09-21
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	JupyterLab and Plotly work extremely well together, allowing users to quickly and efficiently create interactive charts using an array of programming languages and sources. With JupyterLab’s efficient interface, a multitude of files and notebook kernels may be displayed within a single browser tab. Similarly, Plotly provides APIs for nearly all of the programming languages used for working with data and is supported by an excellent repository of chart examples and documentation. This is extremely useful for organizations and individuals with diverse data collection and measurement needs.

Lindsay Richman demonstrates how to use JupyterLab, Plotly, and Plotly’s Python-based Dash framework to create dynamic charts and interactive reports. Lindsay begins with an overview of JupyterLab and Plotly’s APIs for popular programming languages before explaining how to use JupyterLab (via Jupyter notebooks) with Python and R kernels to create datasets based on time series and sentiment analysis for cryptocurrency data and how to transform the datasets into Plotly charts. You’ll see how the charts can seamlessly be repurposed as components in a Dash web app and combined with live-streaming data and written analysis to create an interactive business intelligence report. Lindsay concludes by running some of the data through a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to provide actionable insights for a Python-based trading bot.

	00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,350
okay so it's 4:10 just before I get

00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,340
started can everyone hear me I'm

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,230
honestly I'm not used to just standing

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,120
here I kind of like to walk around when

00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,889
I do presentations but we're split and

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,599
maybe if I were a cubed or something

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,240
like that I could split myself and exist

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,029
in two different areas at once but I'm

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,590
not so I think I'm going to stay up here

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,300
my name is Lindsay Richmond I work for

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,220
McKinsey and principally I work for

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,230
Mackenzie Academy so learning is a huge

00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,900
part of what I do I've been programming

00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,030
now for almost two years and I picked up

00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,739
Python as my first language shortly

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,330
after that I started working with plotly

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,339
because it has a lot of language support

00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,750
and really good documentation and I also

00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,100
started working within Jupiter because

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,890
it's also highly accessible

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,530
I'm anaconda awesome package manager and

00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,659
so when put together both of these tools

00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,580
I think are fantastic they offer a lot

00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:53,409
of language support great documentation

00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,449
more and more widgets are being created

00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:57,670
every day in this example which we'll

00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,930
come back to is a widget that allows you

00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,390
to use a lot of the drag-and-drop

00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,190
components of potli charts to do

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:10,960
directly within jupiter lab which is

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:12,850
awesome so just to get started I'm also

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,500
a humanities major so my background is

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,270
actually in linguistics and art history

00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,039
and so for me it's a little strange

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,679
sometimes working in this environment

00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,909
I'm not a physics major for example and

00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,280
I often think how can I make a

00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,469
contribution when I'm not always like

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,000
everybody else I think it's really

00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,829
important because when we often talk

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,780
about diversity we often talk about

00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:33,670
things like gender someone's background

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,859
but also I think we need to think about

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,229
diversity of perspective and diversity

00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,520
of contribution I also think that data

00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,439
is something that should be used to

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,549
empower humans and that's sort of why I

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,259
like doing what I do with data

00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,030
visualization I think a lot of the

00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:47,109
solutions that we can develop and what

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,819
we can communicate with data

00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:51,280
visualization can really be used to

00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:55,689
empower people but of course technology

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,549
does not always work that way about two

00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:00,310
weeks ago maybe a little more than that

00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:02,950
a large botnet was actually uncovered on

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,659
Twitter by a security company and this

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,549
dealt with cryptocurrency an area where

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,880
I've been a hobbyist for a few months

00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:11,530
now and here's some facts about this

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,769
botnet which was a massive amount of

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,060
bots basically the company do a security

00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,770
used classic machine learning

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,989
methods they trained a bot classifier

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,270
and this is how they found out about it

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:23,800
their best model had about 98% accuracy

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,360
so they looked to see who were the bot

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,500
accounts who were humans who were the

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,510
human accounts they built a really good

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,150
model what they found was that there

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,340
were at least 15,000 BOTS active in this

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,230
bot net so it was massive and this was

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,550
on Twitter and I'll show you in a moment

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,160
in the next slide what exactly these

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,810
bots were doing and the bot net accounts

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,819
actually amplified their posts through

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,830
retweeting so not only were individual

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,269
BOTS within this bot net tweeting but

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,860
they're actually retweeting each other's

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,110
posts so they were amplifying each other

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,709
and really working as a network so what

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,390
exactly did these BOTS do well if you're

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,799
active in the cryptocurrency space and

00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,060
you're on Twitter you've probably seen

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,450
something that looks like this before

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,819
I've seen this many many times these are

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,069
posts that will come anytime a company

00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,360
or a foundation will post for example it

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,670
could be something like the etherium

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,380
foundation or the Kin foundation you'll

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,120
get a slew of these messages and they

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,620
all look pretty similar and they

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,890
basically all follow this same format

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,989
they start out with a little blurb

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,430
congratulating or basically flattering

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,140
you and they always have some sort of

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,250
superlative so if you're not a fastest

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,440
follower you're like a most beautiful

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,750
follower or an awesome follower in some

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,730
way and then what they do is that it's a

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,680
phishing scheme they ask you to send

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,060
them some F and they're going to give

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,890
you some more ëthe back and they usually

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,410
use aetherium for whatever reason maybe

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,720
because so many people trade with it so

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,980
they also ask you to fav this tweet when

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,450
you get yours so they're actually asking

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,720
you to sort of participate in their

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,190
botnet as well sometimes I'll also

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,870
decrement so they'll use techniques that

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,880
are used in flash sales so they'll say

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,920
okay I only have xxx now and 20 and you

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,600
better get it fast but these things are

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,069
really pervasive and when I first

00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,959
started looking at them and talking with

00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,519
people on Twitter we thought that these

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,290
were just people that were spamming over

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,790
and over again but what was uncovered a

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,489
few weeks ago was in fact this was a

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,260
massive botnet interestingly there's not

00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,940
a lot of variance in these posts and at

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,130
this point with the technology it's

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,590
pretty hard to create something novel

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,630
this many times but as we have

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,889
improvements and as AI gets much much

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:23,289
better at as AI gets better at creating

00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,880
natural language at scale and putting

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,530
variance in that sounds natural it's

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,940
going to get a lot harder to detect this

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,340
sort of thing

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,020
so why is this important well rumors

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,180
like bees and general techniques like

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,800
these have been used to inflate markets

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,780
for a long time and cryptocurrency is

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,760
one of the ones that it's that this has

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,250
been very successful in particularly

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,260
with social media so just a few weeks

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,990
ago this is another example of a token o

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,270
X protocol surging 20% on coin based

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,370
rumors so again through social media

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:57,350
these rumors come up and people just

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:58,580
start buying last year towards the end

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,430
of the year when the cryptocurrency

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,220
market was really hot someone noticed

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,920
that code in a coin called Tron's

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,570
codebase allegedly included coin based

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,460
references and they put this on reddit

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,840
and this is actually really significant

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,480
because reddit has been a very powerful

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,630
tool and conveying information and often

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,780
this information is entirely true for

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:23,420
example there now predicted to spoil

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,370
every beat of season 8 as you know with

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,290
their drones they spoiled season 7 of

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,480
Game of Thrones they gave us our plus L

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,220
equals J they gave us William as the man

00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,290
in black so reddit users have been write

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,790
a lot and that's what's interesting when

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,310
somebody posts a rumor about coinbase

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,750
and Tron on reddit eventually somebody

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,790
will debunk it but it can go viral

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,470
pretty quickly and people actually take

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,450
reddit is a very credible source i've

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,370
actually as a game of Thrones fan to

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,930
I've seen some pretty wild spoilers

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,310
actually get a little bit of traction

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,930
attention for a finite amount of time

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,090
even though there's no way they could be

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,220
true but because it's on reddit someone

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,650
will listen for a little while so this

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,000
is the code that was being posted and

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,950
this is interesting and you can see that

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,630
there's coin base here but what was

00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,040
weird to me about this and this is

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,630
probably not very weird to people in

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,500
this room but imagine that you couldn't

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,180
read this at all

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,070
you see the word coin base and you think

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,270
oh like this means coin based the

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,770
company and just to clarify quickly coin

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,260
base is a company that allows you to

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,820
exchange cryptocurrency for fiat they're

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,220
a tech unicorn with a very high

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,780
valuation so this is they everyone

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,460
thought this was a company and that this

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,950
was that this meant that Tron's price

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,840
would inflate and be worth a lot but as

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,160
you can see especially in the bottom

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,930
line this looks like any other object

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,390
that's being passed through a function

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,919
of some sort and so that's what Timmy

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,169
was a little strange because as you know

00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,940
or most of you probably know we could

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,800
name this anything we wanted so I was

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,750
extremely suspicious that this is a

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,970
what people were saying that it was but

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,680
this got a lot of traction on forums

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,449
like Twitter and another forum stop

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,990
tweets which is basically a Twitter for

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:56,539
people who trade so I did some research

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,849
and no coinbase does not mean coinbase

00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:01,400
the company well what is it it's

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:03,379
actually a special field used as a sole

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,729
input for coinbase transactions so this

00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,120
is actually part of the technical

00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:09,440
process that happens during the

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,930
blockchain when there's a block reward

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,819
so this is in fact has nothing to do

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,500
with coin based the company coin based

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:18,259
the company actually got their name from

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,440
this and is a fantastic name but again

00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,759
this was in fact a built in method it

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,250
was basically written into the code

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,629
already you can know from reading the

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,879
code another question that you could

00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,379
have asked was well why not by Nance or

00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,319
any of these other exchanges or bit

00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:35,330
tricks why I only coin base but again

00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,190
for people who really didn't read code

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,159
they saw the word coin base and this

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,169
became a very big rumor so let's take a

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,729
look at a financial chart and this is

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,610
plotly by the way and I promise I will

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,699
get to this so this is a chart that

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,900
shows you from December 2017 what

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,099
happened there was a bit of a spike

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,509
towards the end of the month and that's

00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,490
where I was when I started seeing this

00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:58,159
rumor and then you can see a massive

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,740
spike and very very sharp dissent in

00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:02,690
January so a classic case of buying the

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,090
rumor and selling the news now this

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,219
rumor alone didn't necessarily caused

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,930
all of this buying and selling but this

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,460
is part of a much bigger problem that

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,379
happened and a lot of people lost a lot

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,789
of money because of things like this I

00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,800
actually think that this was pretty

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,509
innocent some of them are not the

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,629
example of the botnet was clearly

00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:23,569
planned ahead of time by probably more

00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:25,099
than one person but this does show to me

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,479
this really showed how powerful it was

00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,099
to be able to work with code and

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,960
understand technology a bit more deeply

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,729
without being able to read code or know

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,560
anything about it I could have just read

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,360
coin base and just retweeted the tweet

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,909
and been part of a rumor that wasn't

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,969
true and I didn't want to do that I did

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,740
try to retweet as much as I could but it

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,180
looks like it didn't work and then I

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,160
thought to myself if only I'd had a

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,630
botnet I could have amplified my message

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,750
and maybe I could have saved people some

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:55,430
money but well I'm working on that so we

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,660
just talked a little bit about variables

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,029
and objects

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,800
here's another variable before I go into

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:03,259
the main talk this comes from a book

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,149
called Guns Germs and Steel which I

00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:06,889
really like and one of the main premises

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,899
of this is that depending on the tools

00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:10,879
and the assets that you have available

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,310
to you that can radically change how

00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,899
fast you work and also radically change

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,670
the trajectory of the success that you

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,410
might have and how fast you'll innovate

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,209
and I think that this is important

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,290
premise to keep in mind when we select

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,000
tools and technology

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,790
one of the main premises that the author

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,350
had was that beasts of burden you know

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,139
for for people who had beasts of burden

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,850
they replaced a handheld cart not all

00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,410
civilizations or people had beasts of

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,240
burden and there are some places that

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,769
are isolated now where they're still not

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,230
used and they're still they just have

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,480
pigs for example so animals that you

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,100
could use um for sustenance but not that

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,779
you could use to pull a cart or actually

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,300
take some of your handheld work away

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:48,800
from you so what I really like about the

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,629
technology and the tools I'm about to

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,519
show you is I think that they're really

00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:54,019
kind of like if you had a handheld cart

00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,730
they could become a beast of burden for

00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,589
you there are things that work really

00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,420
well and I think that they work quickly

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:02,120
and they were designed to do that so

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,800
again thinking back to this analogy it's

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,420
I think that is really important when we

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,189
innovate and we want to work rapidly but

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,470
we want to do a good job to think about

00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:11,449
the tools available to us it's also very

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,980
easy sometimes to get very focused on

00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,899
what we have in front of us and

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,639
optimizing that for example if you're

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,230
really attached to your handheld cart

00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,490
you might just stay and work on

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,740
optimizing it trying to make it go

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,300
faster or carry more weight and not even

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,649
realize that somebody next to you has a

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,930
horse that's pulling a carriage that's

00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:30,230
way bigger and way faster and then frees

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,290
that person up to do something else all

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,880
right so he features of Jupiter lab I

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,610
won't spend too much time on this

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,810
because we are at Jupiter Kong I think

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,490
some people are probably already pretty

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,019
familiar with Jupiter lab so I'll just

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,399
highlight the features that I like and

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:47,000
then I think work really well with

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,589
plotly and - the first is you have many

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,380
hurdles and features but only one

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,660
browser tab so your classic notebook for

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,000
you just looks like this which is very

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,170
nice but if you're like me and you're

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,059
new and you rely heavily on

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,309
documentation you may find yourself with

00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:03,439
a ton of these tabs I also get really

00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:05,389
fascinated by the code so I would end up

00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,620
with a lot of untitled tabs so I'd have

00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:08,240
a lot that look like this

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,800
they had no title because I would just

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,430
jump right in I'd forget the title and

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,500
then I'd end up with

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,430
50 untitled notebooks and I had no idea

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,440
what was in my notebook I didn't know it

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,790
was there this is really nice because it

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,040
kind of gives you a much more integrated

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,380
screen for doing work you can have

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,850
multiple kernels and multiple tabs for

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,950
working in one screen you can also put

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,149
other things in at console I also like

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,830
that your files are on the left-hand

00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,570
side you can right click on the files

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,029
and name them so I've tried to be good

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,260
about not having a ton of untitled tabs

00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,390
and naming them as I go along

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,230
but it's just a lot easier to do work

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,970
with a lot of different things the

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,830
second thing I really like is of course

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,810
a lot of useful extensions new widgets a

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,220
topic that's been covered probably a lot

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:54,440
these last few days so this from my

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,110
first slide is a demonstration of

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,660
Polly's widget for the potli editor and

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,940
this is actually very easy to import you

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,620
put in a bit of Python code and this

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,149
allows you to work with data such as CSV

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,709
files you do need to use Python to

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,420
actually load the data frame but once

00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,010
you do that you can actually do all of

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,140
your work with a drag-and-drop interface

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,610
it's very cool so this gives you a lot

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,380
of the flexibility that you'd have in

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,029
charts studio again you can just click

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,920
and drag and you can even add things

00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:21,589
like a z-axis to do things in three

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,510
dimensions so this is a very very cool

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:28,190
widget and just one example of the many

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,680
widgets that are available in Jupiter if

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,350
you want to try to pa'dar lab it's easy

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,630
you can just have a you can just create

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,190
a virtual instance of it so you can just

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,510
click on this button I won't do that

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,040
because this is one of the few things

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,550
that actually does not work in slides

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,500
comm but you can open this up it will

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,209
generate some starter files for you and

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,580
you can actually explore just by

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:54,410
clicking so now let's get to plotly and

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,970
see how it works with jupiter lab the

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,950
first thing is it has really rich

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:01,430
documentation Joop for jupiter notebooks

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:04,160
and lab so here's an example what you

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,709
have here and as you can see you have

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,350
the core libraries up at the top these

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,360
four have the most stuff available and

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,890
the most features but you also have some

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,300
other languages down here that I'm sure

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,940
some people in this room use such as

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:23,180
MATLAB Julia so let's just take a look

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:24,399
at our API and you have a wide variety

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,439
of charts available

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:32,740
so let's just go to when we're gonna

00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:34,089
look at later time series and you can

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,110
see that there's a lot of documentation

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:41,319
on how to do things differently if we

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,629
take a look at Python we have really

00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:46,420
good support for Python so go to

00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:49,029
boxplots and this is a really nice

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,439
feature here that many of the different

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,999
elements have not all of them but many

00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:53,319
I'm also not going to do this because

00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,600
this is the other thing that doesn't

00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:56,949
work in slides comm interactively but

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,569
what you can do is you can actually in

00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,699
many cases download the notebook

00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,949
directly from the documentation you can

00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:04,480
download it upload it to jupiter lab

00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:06,100
which is really nice and then the file

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,779
simply appears on the left hand side of

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,639
your screen this allows you to actually

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,860
work directly with their code test it

00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,809
out the code is extremely portable

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,029
something we'll talk about in just a few

00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,769
minutes as another feature i like so

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,029
it's extremely easy to reuse different

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:21,100
parts of the code and this can get you

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,540
started really really quickly but again

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,189
i think what's great is that you have a

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,809
lot of documentation on many different

00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:27,730
chart types for many different

00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:29,589
industries and in many cases you can

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,569
just simply click download the notebook

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:34,410
upload it and then you can start playing

00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,410
with a code right away

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:43,689
second one plotly objects are basically

00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:47,620
in charts are based around two objects

00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:54,790
data and layout so let's first take a

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:57,490
look at a chart okay so here you can see

00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,170
we have a lot of functionality here I'm

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,209
going to zoom and show you a drop-down

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,980
menu we'll take a closer look at this a

00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:06,249
little bit later as well here we can

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,079
actually edit it by the months and time

00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:10,509
frames and if we want to go take a look

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:15,069
at something else we can so this shows

00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:16,360
you all of these different views so a

00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:17,800
lot of versatility I mean this is a

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,449
pretty basic chart but already you have

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,370
a lot of versatility with it it's very

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,379
easy to make so if you take a look at

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,240
the code here you can see the data in

00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:27,639
layout objects data objects can be

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,499
created directly or you can pass objects

00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,269
into them so in a lot of the code that

00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:33,579
you'll see in the documentation you'll

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,410
see things like trace this comes from

00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,689
this works very well with pot leaves

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,270
with charts to do as well they're

00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,950
drag-and-drop

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,830
editor because things are usually

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,960
phrased in trace when you go to that UI

00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,570
so in this case you see trace 6

00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,510
obviously there were four other traces

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,880
before that and so tray 6 is here and

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,620
then you see layout so here you have a

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,390
lot of the data and then basic editing

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,280
that can change the way that the data

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,080
looks but most of what you do in terms

00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,120
of the style will actually go into the

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,890
layout part and this gets very very easy

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,300
when you start practicing it's very

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,920
intuitive so you never have to worry

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,930
about a lot of different elements you

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,730
always pretty much know that there's

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,220
data layout and just a couple of other

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:18,290
pieces of code to get the visualization

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,940
going finally and third reusable

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,770
components are absolutely one of the

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,770
most interesting things about this

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,840
little pokey okay it's the iframe great

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,000
so we have components in this chart

00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,320
range slider and range selector I'll go

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,350
back to this chart after showing the

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,110
code here's our arrange select slider

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,980
down here so I can actually use this to

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,390
slide and zoom in and here I have some

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,000
data this is also a very nice feature

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,260
too but again if I want to isolate some

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,320
particular dates and look a bit more

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,060
closely I can use this I can also go up

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,100
here this is also nice and reset the

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,160
axes so this gives me a very fast way of

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,720
going back up here I have my range

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,060
selector so if I want to just isolate

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,200
the last few months

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,240
this doesn't have too much data I think

00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,240
I can do it that way too

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,570
and anytime I want to set everything

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,520
back I can either do that I can click on

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,740
either reset axes or Auto scale to take

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,120
things home so here you actually could

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,490
see that the range slider starts at a

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,650
certain place because there's just not

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:34,370
too much data in this case so what does

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:37,700
this look like in terms of the code this

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,990
is pretty easy here I have the range

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,490
slider I don't think there was quite

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,780
enough space to do all of it but the

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,180
range slider is actually really really

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,100
easy auto range true you can put it

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,870
under the x-axis because that's where it

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,520
goes and it's really really simple I

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,710
mean you can you pretty much just put it

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,059
in and you

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,980
what you get there are different ways of

00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,539
customizing it of course but in a lot of

00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,880
cases you're not going to need a lot of

00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,830
customization the the base form of this

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,750
that will be in the documentation will

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,190
work just fine for you so there

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,330
definitely ways to add more elements to

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,299
this as you can see this is very very

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,580
basic but but you can certainly do more

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:12,649
with it if necessary this also follows a

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,149
similar format with the code so it's

00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:15,710
also not hard to just grab one of these

00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:17,419
from some of the documentation put them

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,159
on top again it's probably the best

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,080
example because it doesn't really go

00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,700
back to much but if I did want to look

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,230
at three months or one month this could

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,360
radically change the view that I have

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,190
when I look at the data so this looks

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,230
pretty flat here for example there's not

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,529
too much movement although I guess

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,390
there's still some what but here you can

00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,610
see that there's a lot more there's a

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,860
much bigger high and low and looking

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,179
over the longer term data so this gives

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:46,970
you an easy way to get different views

00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:49,039
and it's very very easy to do okay so I

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,440
had to have a cat's head in order to

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,240
make this truly a presentation today one

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,890
of the coolest parts of these charts and

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,140
there are many of them is it can also

00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,659
become components within dash apps so

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,500
one of the ways I look at this is

00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:02,179
basically almost like a Russian doll

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,890
where you could have at the very bottom

00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,320
something like a drop down menu or a

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,909
range slider like we just looked at then

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,140
you could actually have the actual potli

00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,760
chart itself which could be a

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,190
candlestick chart it could be a bar

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,899
chart there's many different options and

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,630
then at the very top and the biggest

00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:19,039
form is the dash app or web app and so

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,289
we'll take a look at a dash app that I

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,270
made and deploy it on Heroku and I'll

00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:25,760
show you how you can use that and then

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,529
put the components of plotly and their

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,419
charts into a dash app to create

00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:31,760
something really different because

00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,200
sometimes for me I feel like I let a lot

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,029
of this stuff stay within my notebook a

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,190
little too much and for me the notebook

00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:38,630
is often a very experimental environment

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,059
I'm not always sure that I want to

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,320
publish them or I mean to but then you

00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,270
know I really need to clean my code up

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,070
and I don't so being able to transform

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,590
this especially individualization into

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,179
something where I can really communicate

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,500
that's um that's really important and I

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:56,179
think Dash is a really good framework

00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,130
for doing that before I get started I do

00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:00,620
want to say that - was specifically

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,299
designed to work very quickly it was

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,100
designed so you can create web apps and

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:05,480
pure Python prior to that you really

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,640
needed to use things like d3

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,410
in addition to Python so this allows you

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,240
to work in one language and write a lot

00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,370
less code it's much faster for most

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,169
people I'm guessing since this is a data

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,690
centric conference that they're far more

00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:20,030
Python Python programmers and JavaScript

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,320
programmers here that's just a guess but

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,299
it is kind of nice to work in one

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,520
language in addition if you do work in

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,320
JavaScript you probably know that just

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,120
the term JavaScript itself is a bit of a

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,530
misnomer and that you could be working

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,910
with vanilla JavaScript but it could

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,830
also be something like react where the

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,270
syntax is pretty different in addition

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,460
there are tons of packages that seem to

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,290
come out pretty much every week and it's

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,820
extremely hard to keep up so while it's

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,470
extremely versatile as a language I

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,720
think that versatility also has

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,179
challenges too and that even though you

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,710
can do a lot with it it there's just a

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,850
lot you can do with it a lot of

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,559
different packages in different flavors

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,750
and so just being able to work in Python

00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:57,020
there's something in my opinion really

00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,510
comforting about that so here's a

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,160
picture of my Jupiter lab and this is an

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,900
example of a chart I've cleaned it up

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,070
quite a bit since then I told you that

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,230
my notebooks were like a messy

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,540
environment so this chart looks a little

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,130
messy too and so this is a chart and you

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,200
can see the code up here and all the

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,750
elements it has a drop-down menu on the

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,929
left and then it has several different

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,990
lines for several different

00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:22,880
cryptocurrency tokens and when I put

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,620
into the dash app which I will show in a

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,940
few slides this is what it looks like so

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,260
again I cleaned it up because this is

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,179
like the real thing where I'm actually

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,650
wanting to show this to people and it

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,640
has all the same elements there was a

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,340
little bit of edit

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,260
editing required to to get the syntax to

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,880
work with - but not that much

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,070
I pretty much could just put it in do

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,690
some light editing and then basically

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:51,880
reuse everything that I had done in

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:55,540
Jupiter labs and my notebook okay slow

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,540
we're waiting on Heroku

00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:04,710
while we wait let's go to this slide

00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:06,389
first this app is a prototype so it's

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,789
meant to serve as a representation of an

00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:10,950
actual project the data was only pulled

00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:12,809
from a free mini API so it's a small

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,730
sample if I wanted more data I'd have to

00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,830
pay so this just made sense for a

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,240
prototype I only use time series

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,190
analysis with supervised machine

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,509
learning so you really would have to use

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,820
additional techniques like sediment

00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:25,649
analysis if you wanted to do anything to

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,690
predict any sort of pricing in this

00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:29,220
environment and this primarily serves as

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,110
a boilerplate to showcase the

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,759
versatility of plotly and - so again I'm

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,320
going to show you something that looks

00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,320
it's supposed to be a business

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,450
intelligence report and it is but it's

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,730
also a prototype so I just want to

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,289
clarify that it I really would need more

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,309
data and I'd need to go a lot deeper in

00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:49,710
order to do something that I would

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:52,230
deliver to to someone oh come back okay

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,629
good so this is the the app that I made

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,159
this is a web app I'll quickly show you

00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:59,369
some features because we'll come back to

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,649
it you can scroll through and it's very

00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:03,480
compact and all of these charts are

00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:05,580
charts that I either created or could

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,799
have created in Jupiter lab again a

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,840
great environment for prototyping I also

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,029
pulled the data for the API into Jupiter

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,559
Jupiter notebook because there was a lot

00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,730
of documentation available so again I

00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,080
could leverage all the documentation

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,539
that was available in the open source

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,700
community experiment get an idea of what

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,320
charts I wanted to use make sure

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,840
everything ran correctly and then sort

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,879
of poured it into a more into like a

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:31,769
more permanent environment and you do

00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:36,240
have a lot of features with these charts

00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:37,769
as well this one because I may forget to

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,480
come back to it for example this box

00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:40,769
plot I kind of ran out of space so I

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,350
just put this here again to show a

00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:44,700
different chart type but there's a on

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,529
the first page I write a little bit

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,419
about this and about the upper bounds of

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:49,950
the pricing that neo has had but on the

00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,389
other hand it might be better just to

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:55,289
show something like this to convey the

00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:56,490
information also I'm sure I'm going to

00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:58,499
forget to say this so I'll say it now

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,600
you can also print this to a PDF which

00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:02,610
is really cool I actually did it I

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,590
printed it at my work so again you will

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,509
lose a lot of the interactivity of the -

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,309
charts obviously if you save or print

00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:09,750
this to a PDF but it still gives you a

00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:11,170
really nice report and you can actually

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,180
save use in custom

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,980
waise so if somebody wanted to see

00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,710
something specific within your data you

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,910
could actually just isolate that and

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,830
then print the PDF out with that

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,520
specific view so again it gives you a

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:30,280
lot of versatility so just to refresh

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:32,110
this is a prototype great that came up

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,210
quickly so this was actually forked from

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,460
a vanguard report that is in Dash's

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,980
repository just like Jupiter notebooks

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,420
and plotly - has a lot of documentation

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,870
available online and they're more and

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:46,120
more - apps being created and put up for

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,300
documentation all the time so you can

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,800
see here that this is this pretty much

00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,440
follows a very similar format you have

00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,810
some of the elements of these charts

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,910
given what it is it's a lot more heavy

00:24:54,810 --> 00:25:02,530
in analysis and also in you know what

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:05,290
would be a panda's data frame but just

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:11,740
looks like a financial chart here so

00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:14,170
this is the original so what did I do to

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,500
change it I made light edits to the CSS

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,180
to change the color format and branding

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,700
the one that I deal that I made deals

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,370
with tokens in for a blockchain called

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,230
neo so their colors are green and black

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,420
and so I changed it from red to green

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,130
just to make it look better the CSS is

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,200
largely based on bootstrap so it's very

00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,780
intuitive and very easy to work with and

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,210
the CSS was also leaked externally among

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,070
code pens so I just forked that and was

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,860
able to make the changes and then I just

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,720
linked the new file much of the HTML was

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,060
converted to markdown for easier styling

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,690
of text elements the original had a lot

00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:51,480
of just HTML but it's a lot easier and -

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,100
to work with markdown if you want to

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,690
deal with font weights for example so I

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,480
really want to emphasize a lot in this

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:01,630
and put it in bold or italics and I had

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,070
a lot of you know I basically wanted to

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,390
do a lot of unordered lists and ordered

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,070
lists because I had a lot of information

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,740
that I wanted to convey in a very

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,210
succinct format so for me a markdown was

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,640
a lot easier so a lot of the original

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,440
HTML was replaced by markdown which is a

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,870
- core component and very easy to work

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,450
with I put in some new chart types which

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,370
included candlestick box plot and filled

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,050
area so almost all of the charts that

00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,909
you have in plotly can actually be put

00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,470
in - apps as well some of the

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:27,909
require a little bit more massaging at

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,950
the code than others but most are pretty

00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:31,899
easy to get in and intuitive to figure

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,429
out and also again there's a lot of

00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:35,950
documentation so you can build off of

00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,840
other people's work finally these charts

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,460
have new components the drop down menu

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,070
in the range slider for example or two

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,049
things that were not previously in the

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,570
the other app from Vanguard that I put

00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:47,830
in because I find them very interesting

00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,690
another thing to think about is as we

00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,279
put more data into these and these can

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,080
can these can actually hold quite a bit

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,840
of data especially with innovations in

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,570
the space like data reader and which

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,769
it's like that is that you know we're

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,749
gonna have to have ways to filter this

00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:04,419
data even within something like a report

00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:06,220
like this so a drop-down menu or a range

00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:08,830
slider becomes very very important and

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,389
eventually a search text box where you

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,779
could search for something that might

00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:15,609
become important too so there's ways to

00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:18,369
filter your data and you can get it all

00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:20,979
in alright so here we're back to the -

00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:24,609
app and we can take a look at some of

00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:26,649
these components here so up here I just

00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,450
put in some text I basically used an

00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:31,090
unordered list I bolded some of the key

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,769
elements that I wanted to talk about and

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:38,950
then we can use our range slider down

00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:42,190
here to isolate this and then I can also

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,299
zoom in so if I want to zoom in you can

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,419
actually see that they are in fact

00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:48,099
candlesticks so you get an idea of the

00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:50,080
open the high the low and the close so

00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,639
when I pull the data from the API this

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,830
was a lot of the data that I got this is

00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:55,599
really really nice I may have a code

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,399
example in here if not I'll publish it

00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,529
but it's nice to just be able to pull in

00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,629
this data from the API and basically get

00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:03,639
all of it rendering here in a very

00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:07,090
compact chart so this was very easy to

00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:09,359
make moving along here I go more into

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,679
the various tokens in these ecosystems

00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:15,009
so I almost feel like I should have

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,289
explained what this was but the focus

00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:18,669
really is on the charts so here these

00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,889
are several different businesses that

00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,779
are used within Neos blockchain so

00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:24,279
they're decentralized apps and they're

00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:25,450
pretty representative of what you might

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,789
have in another block chain like

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,830
aetherium so the one I took the biggest

00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,929
look at is alpha cat and that's Robo

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,479
trading and financial advisory we also

00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:36,070
have deep brain chain which is AI

00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:38,229
ontology which provides off skate-off

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,710
change scaling solutions very important

00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:41,710
on a block

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:45,040
and finally Trinity which basically

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,840
offers private services for basically

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,490
for your identity verification so

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,590
another thing that's very important this

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,690
particular chart combines data highs and

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,240
lows from all four of these tokens that

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,500
we're looking at you can also put a link

00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,350
by the way up here if you want to cite a

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,970
source so that's very nice so this one

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,370
works a little differently I can

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,930
actually highlight this way and this

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,550
gives me a much closer view of what I'm

00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,810
looking at the reason I chose it and you

00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,430
could do this many different ways but

00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,930
the reasons I like to keep the high and

00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,070
the low in two lines here is because I

00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,080
could kind of see the difference in the

00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,260
spread and I really liked seeing that

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,120
again I can reset my axis and I can go

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,150
back here and I can take a look at

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,330
something else and again focus in on it

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:33,730
and really drill down very deeply into

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:35,590
this data here's another example it's

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:39,130
just really really interesting to look

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,600
at and if I want to go back I have to

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,160
reset my axes because these are on

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,660
pretty different scales so it's pretty

00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,480
amazing to look at if you look you can

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,130
see that ontology is a has you know cost

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,410
far more than all of these other tokens

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:53,110
down here another thing you can do and

00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,180
again as you get if you if you pass more

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,010
objects in it this gets complicated

00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,270
because again you're getting like all of

00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,070
these different lines that represent

00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,990
something but if you don't have that

00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,700
many you can rely on this feature here

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,430
where you can actually isolate the data

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,710
if you click here this takes this away

00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,390
and now you can actually see this in a

00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,800
very very different view so with

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,420
ontology out of the way which was on a

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,130
very different scale there's now Auto

00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,870
scales and shows you all the data for

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,760
everything else so it's a lot more

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,620
easier now to see the other three tokens

00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,600
although we can see alphaCAT is still

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,730
sort of pitting at the bottom so let me

00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,630
take these other ones out deep-brain

00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:31,210
Jane Trinity and here we are with alpha

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,220
cat so another nice feature is that this

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,930
does auto scale so if you have data

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,630
that's on really different scales it's

00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:40,330
not a problem you can just isolate the

00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,950
different your different objects either

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,440
this way on the side or you can use a

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:50,500
drop-down menu again if I want to go

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:51,879
home I just reset my axes oh oh do I

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,039
really have to do that

00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:56,039
I bet there's a better way to do that

00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,059
it's nice because this panel up here

00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:03,069
allows you to very quickly move between

00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,899
the different panels I don't have to

00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,459
open up another tab or wait for anything

00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:08,499
to load very quickly it's very

00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:10,419
lightweight so these two charts here

00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,949
show volume and fluctuation what's

00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:13,599
really cool about these is that you can

00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:15,729
immediately sort of see a correlation

00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,589
between the two the volume is just how

00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:19,389
much of the trading is going on for a

00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:20,619
specific token the fluctuation is

00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:22,139
basically the difference between the

00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:24,309
high and the low price on a given day

00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:26,889
and if you look at this we can see that

00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:28,749
these look kind of similar at least we

00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:31,239
know that for ontology let's take that

00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:36,099
out and take a look at the other three a

00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:37,509
bit more closely yeah I mean to me these

00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,440
these look again you'd have to drill

00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:40,119
down at the data but these look

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,259
remarkably similar despite being

00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,599
different data points that were

00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:44,979
calculated differently so this is a very

00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,079
interesting insight you can get from

00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:49,329
seeing these side-by-side and if I want

00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:52,449
to drill down more let me go back to me

00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:53,949
actually take advantage of this drop

00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:57,129
down here I'll go to alphaCAT

00:31:53,949 --> 00:31:58,839
specifically and now if you look at this

00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:00,669
you can really see how similar these are

00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,919
again I promise you it's different data

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,449
but these are really similar so it looks

00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,909
like there's a really high correlation

00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:08,979
between these two things these are low

00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:10,239
volume tokens they're small and not many

00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:11,739
people know about them so not many

00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:13,449
people trade and so it's not surprising

00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:15,669
you'd see something like this honestly

00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:18,249
because anytime the volume goes up a lot

00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:19,629
that generally means that somebody has

00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:23,049
come out of the woodwork hopefully

00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:25,629
people and not about net to increase the

00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:26,799
prices or to buy so looking at this as

00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:28,449
somebody who knows quite a bit about

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,579
this token I can actually tell you what

00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:33,489
this was this here was actually caused

00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:37,779
by an announcement and let's zoom in on

00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:39,039
this - yeah remarkably similar this was

00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:40,779
actually caused by an announcement that

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,759
the company made that if you purchase a

00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:44,679
million of their tokens which actually

00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,299
is not as much as you think and you hold

00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,940
them you actually get free business

00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:51,579
insight so you get predictions on prices

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,129
for things like Bitcoin or iOS or

00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:56,169
aetherium or other tokens so you can see

00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:57,579
here that people bought but then you

00:32:56,169 --> 00:32:59,229
know once you started getting the report

00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:00,999
on a daily basis it wasn't clear whether

00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:03,579
you had to hold the tokens or not

00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:05,650
so people subsequently probably chose to

00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:09,010
sell

00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,960
so I reset the axis for this and let's

00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:16,390
take a look at this month not much has

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,830
been going on so not too much has been

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,870
going on this month it was remarkably

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,880
quiet for a while again these look to be

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,890
these look like pretty similar charts

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,809
what I think this was probably caused by

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,220
was the release of some tokens some

00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,050
investors had actually been holding

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,490
tokens for a while and they were

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,930
eventually released to the public which

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,120
means they ended up on auction houses

00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,440
this drove the price down obviously

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,390
there were some other factors that

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,700
caused the overall market to drop too

00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:42,400
but this spike was probably largely

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,050
caused at least in part by the fact that

00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,120
the circulation of the tokens increased

00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,380
so what I find fascinating about this is

00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,290
as somebody who sort of knows quite a

00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,030
bit about this token I can actually tell

00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,440
that you know from just looking at these

00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,090
charts I have a pretty good idea of what

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,350
happened during this time and the

00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,720
interesting thing is there's a lot of

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:00,490
quiet going on except for these these

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,170
really big points up here that usually

00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,520
correlate to some sort of big news

00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,040
announcement so it could be the release

00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,530
of a main net or product it could be you

00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,540
know an increase in coins or a coin burn

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,550
that would decrease the supply of tokens

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,200
it could also be that you know a report

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,090
that oh this actually doesn't work the

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,740
way it's supposed to or could be

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,750
positive news about a partnership maybe

00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,760
with a major venture fund or a company

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,919
like Nike so these types of things tend

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,149
to cause a high spike again this is

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,490
where I wish I'd had time to do a

00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:28,659
sediment analysis on Twitter because I

00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,550
think there'd be a lot of insights to

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,290
glean from that of course given that

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:35,220
there is that huge botnet I think we

00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:37,780
also have to be very careful about that

00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,340
here I just put a little bit of

00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,960
information about a forecasting approach

00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,120
you can use so again this is not

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,500
developed this is a prototype so there's

00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,419
a lot more work that needs to be done on

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,230
this but you could use an algorithm like

00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:52,450
a support vector machine for example and

00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,370
use that with time series forecasting to

00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:56,139
take a look to see what the weights of

00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,970
the different features might be and if

00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,290
they're important or not so the

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,260
interesting thing that I found with both

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:04,540
of these I only did alphaCAT and an

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,300
ontology for this but in both cases

00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,610
there was a really high coral a lot of

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,320
weight was given to the closing price in

00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,760
a given day which was interesting

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,859
because there's actually some other

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,660
articles that have been published I put

00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,079
a link to one of them in the last tab of

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,819
this report that actually show a very

00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,619
similar numbers when looking at a theory

00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:24,959
on closing prices so this is very

00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,369
interesting I'm not really sure why but

00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:28,109
my feeling is that these are generally

00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,789
pretty steady unless there's one of

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:31,170
these huge news announcements and those

00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:33,719
news announcements tend to only come

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:36,059
once every few weeks so on a daily basis

00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,099
you know it's probably using time series

00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,019
analysis can get you pretty far but then

00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,880
you have these massive spikes and to go

00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:43,979
back and just to show you again if we

00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,009
look at the daily fluctuation and

00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:49,529
something like alphaCAT you end up

00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:51,569
having these massive spikes at certain

00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:53,099
intervals and that's when a lot of times

00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:54,089
the news hits and when I think combining

00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,680
this was something like sentiment

00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,680
analysis could be a very powerful tool

00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,509
all right

00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:04,920
so here we just have a bit of a summary

00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:07,369
again I use markdown to do all the

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,450
writing and if you're interested to

00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:11,369
there's a link to the article that

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,049
actually had very similar results using

00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,329
a similar methodology to what I used for

00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:17,099
this but again it sort of just gives a

00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:18,390
bit of a summary about the information

00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,519
that you have so again if you were to

00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,140
write a business report or any kind of

00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,999
report for someone even a scientific

00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,920
paper you could put your summary here

00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:27,180
and for me one of the biggest things I

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,829
think that's important that we often

00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,430
don't do enough when we do analysis is

00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:33,449
some kind of call to action oftentimes I

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,949
do this

00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:36,539
there's analysis for example like

00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:37,859
something sits in my Jupiter notebook

00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,930
and it doesn't really go anywhere and

00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,920
it's not really used for anything so in

00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,779
this case looking at some of the

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,599
features of this you know you have these

00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:47,339
really high spikes in volume and rapid

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,529
price fluctuations that can often happen

00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:51,479
in an hour or less that's really hard

00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:54,029
for a human being to do we know they're

00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:55,920
bots in the space already you know we

00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:58,440
know that trading volume tends to be low

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,119
in comparison to higher volume tokens

00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,069
and then we also know that daily prices

00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,289
are highly correlated with the previous

00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:06,269
day's closing prices one action that I

00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,680
would recommend from this again is not

00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:10,349
more of a hobbyist is just to build a

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,729
trading bot they're already very much in

00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,739
the system so I think it's good to

00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,539
participate in that there are also a lot

00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,089
of open source repositories where people

00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:20,309
are building BOTS primarily in Python

00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:23,569
actually so you could keep continuing to

00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:26,969
work in Python you know up from plotly

00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:28,650
2-2 a bot and a lot of these actually

00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:30,930
have very active communities on slack

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,330
and you know github repositories where

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,610
people are can

00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,500
tributing a lot of new features and bug

00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,300
fixes so you have a lot of very active

00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,340
people in this community who can help

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,110
make these things but again like to me

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,970
it was really fascinating looking at

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,280
this because coming into this space I

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,410
had no idea that I figured it was humans

00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,730
honestly you know it just seemed like

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,650
they were humans who are doing very very

00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:54,260
small granular tasks which should have

00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,970
been a tip-off but in fact you know in

00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,250
very incremental things but in fact

00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,440
looking back at you know when I would

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,850
place a price in an auction house it's

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,500
kind of obvious to me now that this

00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,520
probably was about doing it and not a

00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,110
person so again just to give an overall

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,430
idea of this something like this could

00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,440
be used I mean this is really just a

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,030
shell this could be used for many many

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,620
different things you know and research

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,270
you know even just something that a

00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,710
newsletter so it's really more of a

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,390
communication piece than anything else

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,760
and the cool thing is that you can

00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,620
easily combine qualitative analysis in

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,610
the text with something that allows you

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,170
to really drill down into the

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:34,640
quantitative data a bit more with the

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:36,700
charts all right let's look a little bit

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,840
at the code so how would you make this

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,760
so this is actually really not that

00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,710
different than pot Lee's code at all and

00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,510
it the syntax was largely unchanged

00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:47,870
you'll notice if you look that you'll

00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:50,380
see the DCCC graph DCC stands for - core

00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:53,210
components so dashes core components

00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,990
they're always they have that that they

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,910
begin with that

00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,010
so you'll see DCC but underneath that

00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,660
when you go down to figure you'll see

00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,970
one of our familiar friends data and

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,010
then you'll see go scatter for a scatter

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:06,020
chart in this case this is a line graph

00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,730
and that's also used to make line graphs

00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,230
and then you can also see underneath

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,170
that all of the different attributes

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,820
that are within this so again everything

00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,350
is sort of built around data and layout

00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,010
again it's just wrapped a little bit

00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,420
differently

00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,160
there are also a few different ways to

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,140
do this within - in terms of the syntax

00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,030
so this is just one example that I'm

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:26,390
showing but um it's pretty effective

00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:29,150
here you can see up here the HTML so you

00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,410
have the for h6 you have that header you

00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,750
have the class name the class name

00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,340
actually brings in that that the the

00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,470
green panel that you see so that comes

00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,420
in from the CSS then you have a break

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,190
and then you have your paragraph so

00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,380
using the chart below to explore the

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,760
data so it's very intuitive and I'd say

00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,280
that this particular example of the

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,350
vanguard report was

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,450
easy to read so again even for someone

00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,040
who's just doing this and is pretty new

00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,860
at programming I found this very very

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,920
intuitive to put together because of the

00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:59,710
documentation if we dig a little deeper

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,350
into this we can see a combination now

00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,120
of the markdown and the HTML so here we

00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:06,130
have just the HTML and this was from the

00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,990
original report and then here's where I

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,240
put markdown in because I found it a lot

00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,460
easier to again bold things and put

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,780
things into bullet points so here we

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,200
have the markdown you can see with a

00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,420
double the double stars I put something

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,710
in for neo and it comes out in bold so

00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,300
again this allows you to do a lot of

00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,760
textual editing really really quickly

00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,100
and effectively in HTML I found it was

00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,440
way harder to do it so I ended up just

00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,930
taking out all of the HTML tags which

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,430
were basically tag 2p4 for paragraph and

00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:42,610
I replaced them with the dash core

00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:46,050
component the markdown component so

00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:49,420
we've also taken a look at that alright

00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,860
so for more info you can go to plotly

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,750
webinars and they have a lot of

00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,310
different webinars available most of

00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:59,080
these to be honest or about - at this

00:40:54,310 --> 00:41:00,580
point so for example if you want to do

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,740
machine learning or computer vision with

00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,120
- you can do that you can connect learn

00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,680
how to connect a data source - - so

00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,910
again these are all webinars that have

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,380
been recorded and there are live

00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,450
webinars that come out once or twice a

00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,740
month so really awesome not only do have

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,540
this great code base and community

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,550
online but you also have these webinars

00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,740
that are very helpful that you can do in

00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,230
demand and I believe we're out of time

00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,910
that was really fast sorry for in my

00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,470
head I was singing 5 o'clock so I wanted

00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,970
to thank everybody for supporting me I'm

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,880
women in machine learning a data science

00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,000
for the scholarships to attend potli and

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,560
last year's Jupiter con plotly for

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,020
sponsoring me at their workshops so I

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,730
could actually learn Pali and - Udacity

00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,530
for their scholarships mckinsey Academy

00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,870
for their support am i learning and

00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,430
finally everybody in this room for being

00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:45,750
here and supporting me through your

00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,750
attendance so thank you

00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,900
