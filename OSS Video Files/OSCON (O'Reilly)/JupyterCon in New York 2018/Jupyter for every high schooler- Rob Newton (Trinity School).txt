Title: Jupyter for every high schooler- Rob Newton (Trinity School)
Publication date: 2018-09-20
Playlist: JupyterCon in New York 2018
Description: 
	In an effort to broaden graduates’ mathematical toolkit and address gender equity in STEM education, Rob Newton has led the implementation of Python projects across his school’s entire ninth-grade math courses. Now every student in the ninth grade completes three Python projects that introduce programming and integrate them with the ideas developed in class.

Increasingly, high schools are offering computer science at a variety of levels, from single programming courses to four-year programs that cover everything from logic to 3D printing and laser cutting to writing apps. However, most of these programs are self-selective, and the current representation in the field leads to less diversity. By exposing every student to programming and giving them more of a sense of what programming entails through this program, it is the school’s hope that more students will elect to study computer science.

While Rob—a pure mathematician—thinks that mathematics is beautiful and interesting enough on it’s own and that it need not be sullied with applications, he understands that he would do his students a disservice if he only taught them abstract mathematics. To that end, the single most significant application of mathematics right now is in computer programming. Rob aims for these notebooks to help every math student learn how they can take mathematical ideas, translate those ideas into executable code, and then run that code to answer questions or be used a small part in answering a bigger question.

This program will be expanded to the 10th, 11th, and 12th grade courses as well. Next year, Rob will be using Jupyter notebooks for a 10th-grade math class that will introduce NumPy and linear algebra and use matplotlib to do some basic visualizations.

	00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,450
thank you for the introduction I'd like

00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,690
to thank the organizers for giving me

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,700
this platform to speak I I submitted the

00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,809
proposal then the next day I thought oh

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,730
there's no way they're gonna want to

00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,929
hear that no one's gonna care then I do

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,400
and then they accept me it's like no

00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:18,590
one's gonna come so thank all of you as

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,269
well for being here there are plenty of

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,519
other interesting talks going on right

00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:24,470
now I think I personally would be at

00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,619
visualizing machine learning modules in

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,419
Jupiter notebooks if I wasn't here but I

00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,669
appreciate that all of you came here

00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:33,260
it's also important that I think a

00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:35,390
couple people who helped me with this

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,730
work I need to thank my department head

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,970
who was hugely supportive of integrating

00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,590
more computer science into our program I

00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,050
need to thank the head of our computer

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,640
science program who's been immensely

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,080
valuable for helping me think about how

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,690
to teach programming in a way that's

00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,790
maybe not what it was 20 years ago on

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,730
I'd also like to thank the New York City

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,530
data Science Academy I took some classes

00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,930
through their program and they were the

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,810
ones who really exposed me to the impact

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,030
Juber notebook can have to teach math

00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,960
and computer science so so thanks to all

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:12,020
of those people who helped get me here I

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,850
teach at Charity High School like like

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,190
my disclaimer says it's a very small

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,950
exclusive high school about two miles

00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,810
northwest of here at 91st and Columbus

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,440
so it's just a quick trip down on the

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,510
subway to speak as I go through what it

00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,940
is we're doing and trying to do with

00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,909
these notebooks I completely acknowledge

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,190
the amount of resources and privilege

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,260
that make it all possible and I don't

00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,610
pretend that you could just export this

00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,400
to any other high school and it would

00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,110
work the same like I think I'm in a a a

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,430
unique position to be able to do a lot

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,979
of work but I think some of the things

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,549
I'm gonna talk about can carry over to a

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:52,640
lot of other high schools my background

00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,710
is in pure math I went to math grad

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,640
school studied algebraic topology for

00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,890
six years as I graduated I saw a pretty

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,659
rough academic market that people

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,610
beating themselves up to get into one

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,920
year visiting assistant professor ships

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,879
here were they're applying trying to do

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,779
research and I connected with the

00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,609
independent high school scene and it's

00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:15,200
been incredible going into my sixth year

00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:16,970
at trinity I have small

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,209
says I have motivated students and I get

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,400
to teach a range of topics from freshman

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:24,680
math to linear algebra and cryptography

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,620
there's just a ton of ton of opportunity

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,620
know that I've been afforded at Trinity

00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:37,910
okay so a couple notes that sort of

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,650
inspired some of this work a couple

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,739
notes about maybe the state of computer

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,920
science education in America right now

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:49,220
some facts for whatever facts are worth

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,440
in the climate we live in right now but

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,599
just just a couple observations from

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,410
some studies that have been done on

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,060
computer science and education first

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,450
most weeks or so 40% of schools offer

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,370
computer science with programming seems

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,290
seems woefully low a number that

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,790
surprised me but I know the high school

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,890
I graduated from an upstate New York

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,200
didn't actually offer computer science

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,480
when I wanted to take computer science

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,370
electives there after moving to upstate

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,799
New York they put me in a residential

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,540
electronics class where I was hard

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,930
wiring and soldering because that was

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,780
the closest to a computer so I sort of

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,030
get it I was surprised by the next one

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,750
if I were to ask you what four states in

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,579
America are required or require that

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,519
every high school offer computer science

00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:40,280
course maybe you get Texas it's a pretty

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,049
big pusher for a lot of education trends

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,109
but probably not West Virginia Arkansas

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,060
or Virginia that was 2017 since then I

00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:48,470
would imagine maybe the number of the

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,930
states requiring it have changed a

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,910
little bit a number of states also leave

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,500
it up to individual districts to require

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,840
maybe this district wants to require

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,340
comps I maybe this one doesn't which is

00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,780
also a valid way to do it given each

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,030
district we may be more familiar with

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:11,889
the resources and requirements they can

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:15,380
make we note that 23 states and DC

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,389
require it to fulfill a core graduation

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,880
requirement and this is a big deal

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,270
because high school students often are

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,470
just what do I need to do to graduate

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,090
maybe what do I need to do to get into

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,699
college and if it doesn't fit into one

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,900
of those two buckets

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:34,009
it's probably not going to happen and

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,490
just a little note about where the

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,800
public support is for this 50% of

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,830
Americans rank computer science has one

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,969
of the most important subjects to study

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,050
seventy-five percent said more important

00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,789
than a foreign language like I'm not

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,169
here to say teaching computer science is

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,539
more important than teaching foreign

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:53,479
language I think that is also a unique

00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:55,279
creative incredible experience that math

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,620
computer science and science don't don't

00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,939
compare to but it's interesting to note

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,710
that there is at least the public

00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:03,500
support nothing happens in education

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,629
without some amount of public support to

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,669
overcome the inevitable blacklash when

00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:11,029
the education is different than maybe

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,550
what someone was used to so when

00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:15,439
thinking about this and thinking about

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,779
how do we how do we get students to take

00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,330
computer science even once it's offered

00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,919
I guess back to maybe the note on the

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,310
previous slide about graduation

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,009
requirements and courses at Trinity our

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,930
students take six academics per year up

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,419
to up to six many take five some take

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,009
four and of those six academics are

00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,900
taking they need four years of English

00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:39,469
so one of the six English every year

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,159
four years of math wonderful math one of

00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,469
them science

00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,580
so right away half the courses are our

00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:46,099
fulfill their modern language

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,930
requirement their history requirement so

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,219
now there's just room for one academic

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,930
course maybe a student wants to take

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,370
another foreign language maybe a student

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,899
wants to take a math elective maybe a

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,430
student wants to take an English

00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,770
elective between all of these things

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,319
we've also got to figure out how do we

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:12,680
fit computer science into this students

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:14,629
schedule and then I also note as maybe

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,439
some that applies more to schools in

00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:20,000
public schools is the challenge of

00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,979
negotiating computer science standards

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,899
computer science credentialing processes

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,969
again I'm lucky I teach at an

00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:28,129
independent school we kind of make it up

00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,149
as we go it sounds interesting cool do

00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,460
it make it happen

00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:33,979
and create rewarding experiences as you

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,500
can so although that's also a big

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:40,060
challenge for the public sectors how do

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,060
you manage it all

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,750
so a couple other notes that probably

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,860
aren't going to be a huge surprise to

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,599
anyone in the audience of the AP CSA

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,210
so there there are two different AP

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,219
computer science tests the CSA is

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,780
computer science with Java and the other

00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,360
one is the comp sight principle so it'll

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,129
get more into maybe some of the abstract

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,080
components of programming without

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:06,680
hemming down a specific language only

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,289
22% of the test takers were female this

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,120
observation that women who try ap Comp

00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:14,569
Sci in high school are 10 times more

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,849
likely to major in it in college and

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,979
then 2017 Microsoft survey that was done

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:20,599
in Europe that argued young women are

00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,550
not getting enough practical hands-on

00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:27,349
experience with STEM subjects and

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:30,590
there's a whole body of evidence for why

00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:32,800
this is this this is not a problem I'm

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,500
even going to pretend that I can solve

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,479
in any small way what I'm trying to do

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,879
is just scratch the surface and help a

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,669
couple students have a little bit better

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,339
experience and so one of our

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:47,690
observations is that because computer

00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,819
science doesn't always satisfy a

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,009
graduation requirement because it's an

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,770
elective you end up with a very self

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,389
selected group of students who wants to

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,650
take it who's been exposed to it who

00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,750
knows what it is who thinks they're

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,580
going to be able to do it and so the big

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,469
push for this project is just how do we

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,759
combat the self selectiveness of

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:11,599
computer science and our idea was well

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,550
let's just teach it through math all

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,139
we're gonna integrate some computer

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,520
science into the math curriculum we're

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,339
gonna bring true Couture notebooks into

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,750
the math class rather than wait until

00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:25,279
someone takes a computer science program

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:27,349
class to be exposed to it Oh as I said

00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,029
on the original slide when I said super

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,219
high school on Jupiter for every high

00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:33,229
school student I only meant the 127 in

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:36,380
last year's ninth grade class that was

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,969
the first year we did it last summer the

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,880
department had said to me hey make this

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,500
happen and so we wrote a couple projects

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,810
over the year so that every ninth grader

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,120
would see some Python programming in

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,130
particular with Jupiter notebook this

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,620
year we're going to redo that in ninth

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,149
grade and we're going to expand it to

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,470
10th grade and hopefully this becomes a

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,480
track that follows our students

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:03,740
and just lives as a a a four year

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:06,230
program in our math curriculum so here's

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,080
what I'm trying to do and work with my

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,230
department mates to do within our

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,880
program again this is maybe maybe a

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,800
question that I can answer differently

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,200
than some public schools but the

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,550
question of is there room when you when

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,240
you talk to a lot of teachers about can

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,690
they do new things can they help you're

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,660
trapped

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,740
nope can they do new things can they

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,090
bring things into the classroom that the

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,580
first response you always get is I have

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,570
to cover so much for my tests you have

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,860
tests at the end of the year that are

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,760
going to cover specific topics in you

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,250
have to make sure your students are

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,110
prepared for those tests another huge

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,000
luxury I have at an independent school

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,460
is we don't do the New York standard

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,110
tests my students don't take the Regents

00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,030
test I don't have to worry about what

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,260
their scores are I'm not in fear of

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,190
whether or not I'm gonna get to come

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,720
back on some type of suspension or a

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,340
probationary period because some

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,100
students didn't do particularly well

00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,600
well I get our ap scores I get to see

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,280
what those are but it doesn't really

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,990
impact my my reviews and I don't use it

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,250
a whole lot to think about or to

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,870
evaluate the job I'm doing in the

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:18,380
classroom but the big shift in math that

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,090
over the past maybe five plus years has

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,120
been this thing called inquiry based

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,250
learning how do we get students to ask

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,920
questions what are things students

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,380
should be discovering we're moving away

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,170
from the model where I lecture at a

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,330
board I have you write down theorems you

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,310
do 20 problems that are similar to that

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,200
then you work on 20 more problems that

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,670
are slightly harder you work on another

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,020
set of problems that are a little harder

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,820
still and then you take a test that

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,430
covers exactly those problems we're

00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,670
trying to sort of move away from that

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,080
model in in ways we understand maybe how

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,510
the brain works a little better how we

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:58,280
understand education a little better and

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:59,960
incorporate more best practice so what

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,980
is inquiry based learning or what are

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,420
the four steps essentially first one is

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,160
should be sort of an obvious thing in

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,880
education how do you motivate people to

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,400
ask question

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,260
how do you generate curiosity oh that

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,370
far and away the most important thing we

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,920
do how do we get students that are

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,400
curious and interested and then we let

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,910
them loose research it a different

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,010
reality is the Internet is available now

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,740
my students can google anything they can

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,540
come in with all unusual theorems they

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,950
can come in with unusual problems that

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,410
they've seen they've read about on the

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,500
internet they need to make sense of it I

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,420
need to be able to handle students who

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,250
aren't familiar with that as it's coming

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,540
in from from different directions you

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,520
just have a lot of different things

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:48,680
coming into the classroom now then maybe

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,090
you did 20 30 years ago maybe than the

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,060
next big part is asking students to

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,860
present their findings we do a lot of

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,180
discussion in our math classes if you

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,740
came to one of my classes you might

00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,120
think you were in a history or English

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,670
class given how much students are

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,010
talking disgusting sharing ideas they

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,990
put up problems they present solutions

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,320
they ask their classmates what they

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,910
think they hypothesize well how might we

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,390
do it differently and another problem

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:16,400
and then the most important step is that

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,290
reflection we've gone through all of

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,790
that interesting beautiful work but now

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,190
let's make sure we sort of connect the

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,810
dots pedagogically think about what you

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,880
did we'll think about what you've

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,280
learned and make sure you've mastered

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,770
that the reflection step is where maybe

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,020
the what people used to imagine as

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,490
teaching might happen okay we talked

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,320
about this idea we looked at these

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,240
problems and now I'm going to connect it

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,670
maybe the way I might have done in a

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,670
lecture tie everything together present

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:46,550
terminology give them language for what

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,850
they're thinking about and help them

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:56,300
really not close up the idea but but

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:57,860
come to a good place so it's my

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,080
experience that given we're trying to do

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,100
all of that in math there's plenty of

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:06,410
room to fit computer science with that

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,390
how often do you think about a question

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,950
something you'd like to do with your

00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,260
code something you'd like to try and do

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,920
for a project maybe you Google what's

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,839
available you find Kawara you find Stack

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,520
Exchange you find something there that

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,290
you'd like to work with you figure out

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,660
if it works or

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,519
not if you have the time maybe you

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,870
reflect on what it was otherwise maybe

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,600
you just acknowledge you're done and you

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,430
move on and start the process over also

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
so it seems to me that that if I can if

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,370
I can spark a little bit of curiosity

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,230
with computer science then even just let

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,180
the kids loose on the internet to think

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,860
about what it is they can do they'll

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,380
have a great time and they'll get far so

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,360
how did I do it

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,910
we used Chromebooks it's a cheap

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,800
computer not cheap 130 bucks again back

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,569
to four for us we're able to have carts

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,819
of Chromebooks available we use them

00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:57,170
across departments history teachers

00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:58,910
English teachers will bring them in on

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,410
essay writing days have the kid write it

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,339
up on the Google Drive submit it they

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,990
don't have to worry about what's being

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:06,529
done at home I use the web-based Jupiter

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,610
notebook

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:12,740
Jupiter org tri and that have them

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,300
uploaded I'll pre write the project I've

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,310
head of class I'll email it they can

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,069
download it upload it and do everything

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:22,490
from the web that's a huge advantage for

00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:24,920
us I would love it if all of my students

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,620
had anaconda installed with all of the

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,110
packages and everything up to date but

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,940
but it isn't always the reality I would

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,279
love it if I could just email them ahead

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,199
of time and say hey install this and you

00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,420
would think the young kids of today

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,540
there's so much more tech-savvy than we

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,670
are but you ask them to install some

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,620
software or you ask them to download and

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,199
upload something and they just what I

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:53,449
did I don't understand it I can't I

00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,620
can't resolve that but oh well so to

00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:56,029
integrate computer science

00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,880
we've got Jupiter notebook and we've got

00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:02,329
Python Python struck me as the easy

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,819
choice for an introductory language the

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,949
syntax is great it's clean it's a

00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:12,170
professionally used language there's

00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:13,310
just a lot of upside to using Python the

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,260
biggest thing I think is that it's

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,850
readable you can read Python and have a

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,829
pretty good sense of what the codes

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:25,750
gonna do and so for all of that I

00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:25,750
decided to try a Python with them

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,360
so a bit of a look to what we do in math

00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,600
and sort of we'll figure out where the

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:40,220
various Jupiter notebook projects fit

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,610
into this in talking about inquiry based

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,649
math and what that means we we've gone

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,990
to an integrated curriculum rather than

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:52,160
maybe the algebra geometry algebra 2

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,930
that many of us had growing up and the

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,360
ninth grade we do integrated algebra and

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,639
geometry in the 10th grade we do a bit

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,260
more of that so so over 9th and 10th

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,399
grade you've probably learned most of

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,680
what you're familiar with in a

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,070
traditional algebra geometry algebra 2

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,630
curriculum we've just sort of chopped it

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,139
all up move things around and done a

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,310
little bit of both all at the same time

00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,899
whether the big the big mover in 9th

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,519
grade that way we really are glad we

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:18,199
introduced those vectors our ninth

00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,850
graders see vectors they have a sense of

00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,260
what you can do with vectors and then

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,910
now that we're also teaching physics in

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,490
the ninth grade that helps them in the

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,440
physics class as well

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,529
our 11th grade on paper looks like a

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,600
fairly traditional precalculus course

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,100
we'll get through all the functions we

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,829
do this thing that I call introduction

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,839
to infinity but it's limits its series

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,140
and sequences it's all of these other

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,820
things although that aren't just

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,880
graphing or modeling with a a peculiar

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,730
new function and then in the 12th grade

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,949
we have three options calculus at three

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,110
different levels we have a statistics

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:55,760
course and then occasionally we offer an

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,160
elected called advanced topics in math

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,550
last year that's the one I did linear

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,750
algebra group theory and cryptography

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:08,270
with was a lot of fun but but not maybe

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,549
not the target audience for most of this

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,939
work that I'm trying to do by exposing

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:15,589
all of the students to Python so even in

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:18,110
that class I still end up with students

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,669
who have never seen programming bright

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,829
bright hard-working brilliant math

00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:24,230
students just have never touched a

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:29,419
computer program so so it's still fun to

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:31,730
introduce that in there as well so what

00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,440
are we do in the ninth grade our ninth

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,200
grade class the students joke is

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,480
essentially all triangles all year we

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,159
start out with congruence we look at

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
properties of triangles we look at how

00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,549
to

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,950
shapes are congruent using triangles

00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,779
once we have a sense of what congruence

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,880
is we talk about how it is you get

00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:50,889
congruent things so then that shifts us

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,570
into transformations rotations

00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:55,720
reflections and all of these things that

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,789
now were motivated by congruence after

00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,889
there we go to similarity which is again

00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,779
about triangles let's talk about how

00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:05,679
triangles are similar how you can prove

00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:08,500
they're similar so the natural choice to

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:14,230
me for how to integrate some Jupiter

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:18,149
notebook was with triangles so our first

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:21,669
project I aim to introduce variables

00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:23,409
mathematical operations if/elif/else a

00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:26,110
little bit of logic with triangles as

00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:28,179
well as the print command and variables

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,120
are fun to talk fun to talk about with

00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:34,539
the kids the difference between x equals

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,299
2 and 2 equals x in math we treat those

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:38,470
things similarly right equals is

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:42,070
reflexive whatever you go either way

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,649
with it totally fine but but in computer

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,919
programming this is a big deal or x

00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:49,769
equals 2 versus x equals equals 2 you're

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,269
asking different things and as

00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:53,950
frustrating as it is when I forget which

00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:56,080
one I'm using I forget that second

00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,269
equals sign I still understand and

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,860
appreciate that it's there and I and I

00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,720
think most of them sort of were able to

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,519
develop a sense between are we saying

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,210
this is equal to that or are we asking

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:12,549
if it's equal to that and and how that's

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:14,649
reflected in the code so our first

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,169
project was just using the triangle

00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:19,779
inequality along with some if statements

00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:22,539
to check if three numbers can be the

00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:25,899
sides of a triangle or not I'll create a

00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:29,799
little if statement if X minus y greater

00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:34,419
than Z or X plus y and X plus y less

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,860
than Z we get a triangle else print

00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,960
something else and then and then within

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,700
that okay well if you know it's a

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,340
triangle can you check if it's a right

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,289
triangle and then to get them to think

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,399
through that to try and get them to

00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,899
figure out how to figure out which is

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:49,149
the biggest side without maybe just

00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:52,659
introducing some maximum function right

00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:53,890
off the bat just to work a little bit of

00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,290
that logic

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,780
into their thinking we all we often like

00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,450
to take credit in math as teaching

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,490
logical thinking but but I think coding

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,710
gets at it much much more rigorously

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,810
specifically does it do exactly what you

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,940
thought it would do or not the partial

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,530
credit encoding is very different did it

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,590
run or not did it kind of do what you

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,150
wanted or not and so I've really enjoyed

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:21,370
using it to get them to think more about

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:22,720
logic the second project was just to

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,160
take all of that work we've done in the

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,850
first project and then convert it to a

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,380
function how can we define functions now

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:33,190
and when I say project one that was

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,570
probably 80 minutes of class time 80 90

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,450
minutes of class time to get them to

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,820
work through all of that with pre-loaded

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,470
jupiter' notebooks I like the notebook

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,110
because I can have the syntax there I

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,940
can ask him to try it and then redo it

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,160
with some of the syntax I've already

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,990
given them functions was a shorter one

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,180
just one day to convert that and come up

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,540
with some new functions talk about how

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:58,210
variables work inside functions and I'm

00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,860
excited for project two to actually pay

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,990
dividends later when we define a

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,670
function in the end of 10th grade 11th

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,550
grade all right this is this important

00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,870
idea that there can only be one output

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,740
now that they've seen in program with

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,060
functions it should be clear why that is

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,040
and then the last project we did sort of

00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:20,560
at the end of the year was loops and

00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,040
getting at range getting out for loops

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,190
getting at peculiarities of counting

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,230
getting out while introducing them to

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,850
infinite loops and it's pretty fun cuz a

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,830
lot of them will sort of ask the

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,180
questions about it it's when they're

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,740
working through these workbooks they

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,260
just generate oh what happens if you

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,240
remove them and it's really easy to say

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,400
I'll just remove that command see what

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,130
it does you won't break anything like

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,140
it's it's going to be fine and just the

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,390
maybe the increased amount of risk they

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:54,490
would take as they work through the

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,990
third project so an interesting question

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,440
question has to be well how did it go

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:03,220
did it work did it not work one thing I

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,630
wasn't actually expecting is the and

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,330
this will come up again in a future

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,190
slide for things we need to address is

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,230
the reluctance of some of my colleagues

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,110
to lead a class through something as

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,389
simple as if statements there are ten of

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,850
us in the math department I would say

00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:21,610
five of us probably have some coding

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,519
background but the other five maybe have

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,830
never seen it so send the workbook out a

00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,739
couple weeks in advance hey work through

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:32,470
this tell me how it goes and think about

00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:34,200
how you would lead a class oh I can't do

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,519
that I'm gonna need you to come in Oh

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,230
fine but what's the message we're

00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,960
sending to the kids there that you don't

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,570
need me to come in come on you can do it

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,679
so that's that's that's a continued goal

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,549
it is building their confidence in that

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,019
but but there was one note that I

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:51,489
thought I was really really happy with

00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:53,230
and I had to throw it into this slide is

00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:54,999
we had a student in particular female

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,950
student we asked after one of the

00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,739
classes to reflect on how it went and

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,389
she said exactly this I did programming

00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:03,820
at a summer camp and it seemed really

00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:06,220
hard but this was pretty easy and kind

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,460
of fun and like I just melted it's like

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:12,159
yes it worked I did my job I get those

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:16,269
teaching feelgood's it was it was

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:20,200
absolutely absolutely fantastic I very

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:21,639
very appreciative that she said that so

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,320
we did it in the ninth grade what do we

00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:25,029
do next

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,279
obviously as I said earlier we want this

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,529
to be a four year strand we want a

00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,970
little bit of it to show up every year

00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,799
every year we'll build on what we've

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,419
done I will make it a bigger bigger

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,200
program I'll introduce more of my

00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:40,330
colleagues to programming so this is

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,639
going to be my next year project I'm

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,639
I've moved from our ninth grade team to

00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:46,090
the tenth grade team in particular to do

00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:49,179
this

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:52,239
and so our tenth grade gets into a lot

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:54,249
of 2d three-dimensional geometry we

00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:57,489
explore vectors more we introduced dot

00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:59,379
product so I'm excited to see what I can

00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:00,850
do with numpy see if I can get them

00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:02,259
using some matrices see if I can

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,539
introduce them to the idea of packages

00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:05,859
oh maybe you're not familiar or huh you

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,600
don't know how Python is going to do

00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:09,279
something but someone's probably figured

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,289
it out most of your questions are

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,029
natural questions that people would want

00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:15,249
to ask and things they'd want to do so

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:17,919
let's go back to that step of research

00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:20,409
what's out there and then additionally

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,800
I'd like to do transformations with the

00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:22,500
kids

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,770
I think this will be a fun way to get a

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,760
functions to really use matrices to use

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,890
some of that trig they've been

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,890
developing right triangle trigonometry

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:47,080
'information to it and then look oh

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,880
you've by hand rotated some image one of

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,740
my summer projects has been learning

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,440
homography I don't know if anyone's

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,180
familiar with 3d visualization and using

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,310
homography and a lot of linear algebra

00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,260
and our honors crack actually gets into

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,360
a bit heavier math and I think I might

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,070
be able to explore some of that which

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,870
could potentially have interesting AR

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,430
applications is getting them to do a

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:11,770
little bit of AR and understand the way

00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:14,050
of 3d geometry works so conceivably this

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,670
will be two years down the line when we

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,710
get these current sophomores are then

00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,000
going to be 11th graders and they're

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,620
doing all the analyzing all those

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,840
functions I'll try and get them to use

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:27,010
matplotlib do a little bit of graphing

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:30,730
as well as recursion this past year I

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:33,370
had sort of a weird reflection we teach

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,520
recursion and math but we have them do

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:39,610
it by hand here you go here's this

00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,680
sequence use recursion to find the third

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,870
term and it's like well it doesn't seem

00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,500
like that's really grasping at the power

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,270
of recursion to just by hand do two or

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,610
three so it almost seems foolish to

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:54,100
teach it without computer science along

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,560
the way so I I'm excited for all of the

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,490
things we're gonna do with recursion one

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,740
of my favorite recursive problems is

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:05,170
asking someone to write a program that

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,360
outputs the steps for the towers of

00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,390
Hanoi problem you've got to move the

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,340
tower from one pillar to one of on other

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,530
two pillars and there's certainly a lot

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,600
of ways to do this problem but there are

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:21,460
some very very elegant ways that use

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,810
recursion and solve it very simply 12th

00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,530
grade is I think we're going to be able

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:28,330
to do a lot of work with this in

00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,760
particular statistics there are some

00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,520
that argue that then our Benjamin has a

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,570
great TED talk on this that statistics

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,549
should be the culmination

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,440
of a high school experience not calculus

00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:40,269
that we should move past calculus as

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,769
king and I don't know either way and

00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,860
we're integrating more stats into our

00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:47,289
core curriculum but as indicated in the

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,330
graphic there are a I feels a bit

00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:51,669
foolish to me that we teach statistics

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:55,000
with a graphing calculator like I don't

00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:59,980
think data scientists go into the job

00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,779
whip out their ti-84 connect it via USB

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,539
to the computer so they could import

00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:06,879
some small amount of data onto this

00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,850
calculator and then run statistic it

00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:11,110
just doesn't seem realistic to me but I

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,210
think now that they've got these Jupiter

00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,970
notebooks they can do pretty high-level

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,529
professional statistics and the goal

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,169
would be to introduce them to pandas to

00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:23,559
scifi and scikit-learn we're in the

00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:25,659
process of moving our AP stats class off

00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,370
the calculator right now so this one I

00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:29,679
don't even think we'll need to wait

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,809
until the current sophomores trek

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,350
through to 12th grade and the argument

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:37,840
we had was our vs. Python do we use our

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,029
do we use Python one of our statistics

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,149
teacher has in our background from maybe

00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:46,149
20-30 years ago and it certainly makes

00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:47,919
sense ours a great great great tool but

00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:50,679
Python seems to tie in better with

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,370
everything else we're doing so I think I

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,980
won that battle but I want it pending

00:27:53,370 --> 00:28:00,029
providing a lot of support to her Python

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:06,580
development but I'm excited to do that

00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:08,440
and then calculus what is calculus well

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,990
we study the rates at which things

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,299
change and how much they've changed and

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,639
a really useful useful useful feature in

00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:17,799
calculus is that we can approximate

00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:19,330
things nicely we do we do a lot of

00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,610
approximation with calculus and this

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:28,720
seems like a great way to integrate a

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:30,519
whole unit that's just coding we usually

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,710
look at Newton's method a way to find

00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,570
zeros iteratively we'll compare it to

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,360
the bisection method we can compare

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,590
which runs faster and why all we can

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,600
acknowledge that maybe we're using more

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,370
information and one algorithm than the

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,190
other and that's why it's able to run

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,660
faster but I think a computational

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:51,830
calculus class will be

00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,810
pretty helpful for our students so

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,280
conceivably student goes through our

00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,290
math program for years it's not say

00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,850
they're going to be professionals but

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,660
then when some sense have seen all of

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:04,640
these topics just just by taking math

00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,590
for four years and they'll be positioned

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,110
well to go on to take whatever computer

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,580
science to think about what types of

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,320
questions they can ask an answer

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,450
students that aren't even going into

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,950
STEM fields students that want to go

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,440
into sociology and want to be able to do

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,960
some type of statistics right statistics

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,990
is a huge huge hugely applicable field

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:31,130
and now our students can take that into

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:34,750
other domains so like I said earlier

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,980
what's what's maybe the biggest hurdle

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,720
training more teachers how do we get

00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:43,700
more teachers that are comfortable with

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,350
programming my my summer sort of

00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,260
professional development spin has been

00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:51,290
working at NYU to learn robotics and

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,610
that's been pretty neat but among what

00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,830
you would imagine is a somewhat

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,080
self-selected group we had teachers who

00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,300
have never seen computer programming

00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,970
before and we're trying to sort of

00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,480
hunker down in this primitive basic and

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:08,900
try and program robotics and just have

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,970
no sense of what a for-loop is how do we

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,430
want this to run how do we control that

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,320
so so I think the biggest push has to be

00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,630
let's train more teachers regardless of

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,920
whether they're CS teachers are not just

00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:25,010
in the elements of programming one of my

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,900
colleagues from the NYU program that

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:29,180
just just wrapped up last week said I

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,100
still don't know what MATLAB is other

00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,410
than it ran for two days on my home

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:40,450
computer and then did nothing and it was

00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:43,430
like oh no oh no we've got to beat that

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:46,040
so most of what I've done is used the

00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:49,070
math content to drive some computer

00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,680
science and I think my end goal would be

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,120
to flip it here's some math you want to

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,920
explore some math you want to think

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,230
about so use a little bit of computer

00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,140
science to explore the math and this

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,580
problem came up in my topics class maybe

00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,890
you've heard of the posted

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,410
stamp or the Chicken McNugget problem if

00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,720
you've got boxes of three McNuggets in

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,550
boxes of five McNuggets what's the

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,480
largest amount of big nuggets that's not

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,210
possible

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,660
with those two combinations and this

00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:20,720
generalizes it to more than two boxes of

00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:23,270
McNuggets and students brute forced it

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,040
and they found it wasn't running fast

00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:27,380
enough to get an answer that it was

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,970
going to take years oh so so then it

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,470
became well let's use math to figure out

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,330
how to get at these answers more

00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,590
elegantly and then so that was sort of

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,060
one of the first times we were able to

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,840
sort of flip it and try and solve a math

00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:41,080
problem that we needed to answer after

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,150
asking it as a computer science program

00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,030
to other sort of big big big pipe dreams

00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,830
not not going to get to soon but Jupiter

00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,710
notebook can be used to control the pins

00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,840
on the Raspberry Pi with GPIO so now we

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,190
can integrate some circuitry and look at

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,700
how the logic is working in those

00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:04,220
circuits as well as some robotics with

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:07,810
gazebo and Ross so thank you all for

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:13,660
staying with me are there any questions

00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:22,340
[Applause]

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:27,070
no one in the back didn't like you might

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,070
be able to big bytes just yeah

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,980
yes yeah certainly there's a bunch of

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,540
we've started to look at how do we

00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,010
integrate so the question was am i

00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,740
familiar with the book doing math with

00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:41,290
Python and yes we've got that one

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,570
there's also a great free stats book

00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,280
that integrates python that we're gonna

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,680
look to integrate just to give the kids

00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,320
more resources I imagine it becoming

00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,960
like some type of resource list look at

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,110
these books but for sure

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,240
thank you well another similar book is a

00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,530
hacking math class with Python if you've

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,350
heard of that one hacking

00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:04,570
yes hacking math class with Python he

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,400
also has a website as well will

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:10,450
correlate with that book sweet thank you

00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,580
all write that down one of the things I

00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,740
was excited about to speak here is that

00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,480
I would have a room with industry

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,890
professionals that could share much much

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,070
more of the tools they've encountered

00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:23,530
than I would be able to find quickly yes

00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:26,620
hi when the students are going through

00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:29,160
it one of the things that the notebooks

00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,960
really make easy is visualization in an

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:37,260
interactivity are you seeing that

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:40,270
reflected in your classes so Esper

00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:44,550
interactivity not in the sense where

00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:47,440
they're creating like interactive

00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:49,360
graphical things oh I am seeing a little

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,830
bit of interactivity as per what happens

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,360
when I change this how do I modify this

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,530
what happens if I tweak this what

00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,650
happens to all of this definitely

00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,390
definitely a lot of questions around

00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,570
that that was how we sort of stumbled on

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:04,120
to infinite loops well what happens if

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,180
you remove this and then well what's

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,170
happening and why and then that's yeah

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,520
they have been have been a great way to

00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,720
get them to ask some questions

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,850
it's just play around with it and see

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,850
what you get one more than will come

00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,950
back yeah I've always kind of thought

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,780
that the math area would be the ideal

00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:22,540
match for a computer science in the high

00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,800
school level have there been other you

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,060
mentioned physics briefly have there

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,110
been other fields that have been sort of

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,430
curious about what you're doing and

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,380
thinking oh maybe I could model or

00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:33,250
simulate some physics kind of stuff so

00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:36,010
for sure we've seen science slowly take

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,570
on more our our advanced physics is all

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,790
mechanics and they did a number of

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,240
Python projects this year another

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,980
peculiar thing

00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,590
excuse me maybe this goes into a

00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,020
different realm of Comp Sci as our

00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,909
history program had the students create

00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,310
board games and they had to 3d print the

00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:53,629
pieces so that was really neat to see

00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:58,360
then those students had to open I think

00:34:53,629 --> 00:35:03,980
we use AutoCAD maybe open open open SCAD

00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:05,330
to create stuff and get at that so we're

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,310
seeing it in some departments are the

00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:11,570
one thing that's going to be big is we

00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:13,430
do these weekly teacher presentations to

00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,930
other teachers and so I think a couple

00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,830
of us are gonna have to figure out how

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:20,510
do we present programming to the

00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:23,270
population more broadly English teachers

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,360
history teachers I would love to get to

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,740
where say I'm doing text analysis with

00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,900
some of the English teachers let's let's

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,190
this is one of my friends huge huge

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,600
Shakespeare buff let's take some

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,060
Shakespeare and let's look at what's in

00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,220
the text so let's analyze it anytime you

00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,980
read about this analysis that they find

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,750
this work really looks just like this

00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,960
work well let's show them how that

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,640
happens we introduced vectors in the

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,530
math curriculum in ninth grade so now we

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,810
can do some word to vex stuff and look

00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:59,510
at what's going on there to do some text

00:35:50,810 --> 00:36:01,550
analysis hi I was wondering if all this

00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,010
material is open somewhere is a way that

00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:06,700
we can contribute to I think in what

00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,050
this whole thing to spread it out and

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,090
because I I feel like there are a lot of

00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,170
people that will be really grateful if

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,560
this might be out there

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:18,260
totally totally is it so I would love to

00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,700
get them all out there I suppose the

00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,530
next step for me then is to make a

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,780
personal website that's got it all on

00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,700
there I don't know that institutionally

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,590
we have like the Trinity math website

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:36,380
where you would see all of this but I am

00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:37,880
happy to share oh I totally totally I'll

00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,630
make that no github that's certainly the

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,700
right way to look at it and I think that

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,700
is also a great segue into what the next

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,350
presentation is going to be about

00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,560
presentation of a group from Canada

00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:53,240
that's using github to do this exact

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,040
thing so if you're interested in that

00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,510
bio let me stay around and listen to

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,500
what they're gonna have to talk about or

00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:01,400
they're doing something very similar

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,740
exactly in that vein extremely

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,550
interesting I going back to your math

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,960
curriculum one of the things that we

00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,020
find really good when we're teaching

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,820
Python to adults is the quick response

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,980
that you can get right you can get a

00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,510
graph right away and so on I found it

00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,670
interesting though that you're pushing

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,220
the matplotlib and the pandas until much

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,810
later whereas that's kind of my intro to

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,150
stuff is just like if you get these

00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:28,760
things down quickly you can start making

00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:32,390
really graphs and people get excited by

00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,700
that so the question is twofold is what

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:36,410
informed that choice and the second

00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,290
thing is as you're looking at how you

00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:41,180
teach math what ideas are you getting

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,370
about changing the order of the

00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,920
curriculum the way you teach math given

00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,600
that the kids now have these tools that

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,240
kind of bring it alive in a completely

00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,720
different way so as per as for the first

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,860
question of ordering of tools or

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,290
computer science head and has been

00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,210
thinking for a long time recently about

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,770
how to teach programming what's

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,710
important what do they need to get out

00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,930
of it and so I think he's in some sense

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,920
a little reluctant to hand over too much

00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:11,750
too quickly for whatever reason that's

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,130
that's where he's at and and so the

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,120
thing that just made the most sense to

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:19,490
us at the time was let's start using

00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,410
some logic to to the graphing and

00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,500
something that has changed the way I

00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:26,780
teach is desmos and online graphing

00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,570
utility that's just mind-blowing ly fun

00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,570
to play around with math probably is one

00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:34,610
of the least doodling or experimental

00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,320
subjects you'll do you can doodle you

00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,060
can do art in science you can have

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,980
questions you can do experiments but in

00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,930
math how do you how do you create

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,700
hypotheses and answer them and desmos

00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,110
has been a game-changer there it's it's

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,790
not Python but there's still a little

00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,860
bit of programming solving for variables

00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:52,610
and getting at that very very visually

00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,800
satisfying component of seeing it so so

00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,330
for sure there may be as we do more

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,580
graphing well it will decide it does

00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,050
make sense to push the matplotlib and

00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,150
some of that down like I could certainly

00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:05,030
see the argument for that it just

00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,650
happened we didn't yet also also our

00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,960
ninth grade course is very proof based

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,910
anyways so so the logic fit I think

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,330
a little bit better but it's also

00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:17,359
coordinate geometry so I could see CA

00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:19,790
going both ways I just wanted to share a

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,580
vignette I heard from a colleague about

00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:24,260
a similar experiment that took place

00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:27,380
associated with the science fair in

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,089
Chicago so a group of students were

00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,040
interested in data science and they

00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:33,980
submitted a data science project in

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:39,130
Chicago that was reviewing data

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:43,160
associated with the profiling of

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:45,589
arrestees so this was a group of

00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,230
students from a rather poor high school

00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:50,530
who were African American who then did a

00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,540
data science project using Jupiter and

00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:56,210
pandas to study racial profiling in

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,770
Chicago in the context of a science fair

00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,230
and so I think there's this really

00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,660
interesting twist there where it's a

00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:05,150
math class but there's actually an

00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,710
engagement in digital citizenship and a

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,280
transformation in the discussion around

00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,480
the this politically volatile issue by

00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,980
students who are doing something in a

00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,170
science fair and I just think this

00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,119
overlap of these themes is really quite

00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,859
exciting totally told me that's a great

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,300
observation great story one of those

00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:23,720
things we're looking at more

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,339
particularly given the amount of

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,140
privilege we have as an institution is

00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,390
how do we integrate more social justice

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,619
into our program for English and history

00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,780
I think that's an easy question to

00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,760
answer for math I think it's a harder

00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,200
one at times and examples just like that

00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,650
with the economics with these statistics

00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:44,089
and getting at analyzing and asking how

00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:46,130
about issues like that just give a round

00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:47,780
on a bus to Rutter you know thank you

00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,170
all thank thank you all very much for

00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,170
