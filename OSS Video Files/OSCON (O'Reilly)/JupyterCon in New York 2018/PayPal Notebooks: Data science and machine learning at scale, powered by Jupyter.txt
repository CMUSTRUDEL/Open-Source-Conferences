Parameterized notebooks: An extension to make notebooks more interactive
Notebooks scheduling: An integration with Airflow to schedule notebooks
GitHub integration: An integration with PayPal’s enterprise GitHub repository to share and collaborate with notebooks
One-touch kernels: A simplified way to access any compute or storage
Unified Data API: An integration with PayPal’s unified data API to access almost any storage engine directly within notebooks
