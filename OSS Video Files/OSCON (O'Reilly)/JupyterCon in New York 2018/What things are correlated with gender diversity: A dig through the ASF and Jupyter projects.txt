Description: 
	What things are correlated with gender diversity: A dig through the ASF and Jupyter projects
Holden Karau (Google), Matt Hunt (Bloomberg)

Many of us believe that gender diversity in open source projects is important (for example, O’Reilly, Google, and the Python Software Foundation). (If you don’t, this isn’t going to convince you.) But what things are correlated with improved gender diversity, and what can we learn from similar historic industries?

Holden Karau and Matt Hunt explore the diversity of different projects, examine historic EEOC complaints, and detail parallels and historic solutions. To keep things interesting, Holden and Matt conclude with a comparative analysis of the state of OSS and various complaints handled by the EEOC in the ’60s, along with the solutions, suggestions, and binding settlements that were reached for similar diversity problems in other industries. This comparison is not legal advice but rather examples of what we can learn from early equal opportunity commission decisions.

Topics include:

Diversity of gender among the different levels of a given project’s leadership (committers, PMC, etc.)
The existence of codes of conduct
Language used in comments, code, and mailing lists
The rate of promotions for project participants

I and thanks everyone thanks for coming

00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:07,540
everyone today we're going to talk about

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,480
things that are correlated with gender

00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,970
diversity in ASF projects which we've

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,380
done as a data science stroll through

00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,220
online logs the first thing is what is

00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,560
this all about

00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,909
what is this all about well so there's

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,529
there's a few things um one of the

00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:25,960
things is there's not a lot of metrics

00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:28,029
around open source diversity to begin

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,349
with there's there certainly some but

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:31,449
there's a lot of raw data that we can

00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:33,250
use to make some metrics and then maybe

00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,350
from these metrics we can find

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,730
interesting ideas we can't prove causal

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,769
links but we can find interesting ideas

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,359
for things to try in our open source

00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:45,010
projects and see if they help at all

00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:48,609
it's also a fun use of Jupiter and spark

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,050
and we put ml in the abstract but yeah

00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:51,699
we just some correlations it

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,160
turns out the linear regression model is

00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:56,499
kind of garbage but pull requests are

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,899
totally welcome if you want to like try

00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:02,920
and make it less garbage that would be

00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:04,150
greatly appreciated right she

00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,650
exaggerated a little bit we have

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,720
notebooks to go along with this project

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,850
that pull data and do the correlations

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,770
and have some very interesting follow-on

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,530
questions and we'd love help on them so

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,870
who are we we've been friends for a long

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,090
time and interestingly enough we have

00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:22,800
almost nothing in common so I'm a New

00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:25,270
Yorker Aldens from San Francisco and

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,120
wants you to follow her on YouTube yeah

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,660
I different I want you to not follow her

00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,460
on YouTube but you know we do actually

00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,160
believe that you know variety divert

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,570
diversity and different opinions can

00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,840
actually make life and everything else

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,390
more fun of course whenever you're

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,690
looking at correlations and biases you

00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,480
know we all have our own we all have

00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,190
more in common than we have different

00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,350
we're both we both live in large cities

00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,380
in the coast and we're North American

00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,880
techies and we have a shared

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,460
appreciation for the Cheesecake Factory

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,020
which maybe she says the Cheesecake

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,370
Factory actually plays a very

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,940
surprisingly important part in this

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,890
presentation so we were we were actually

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,310
dining attitudes we can call it dining

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,200
dining at a Cheesecake Factory together

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,380
fine dining find out some some might say

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,060
eating I wouldn't use the word enjoying

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,190
but we were at a Cheesecake Factory and

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,930
I was thinking about how we ended up

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,980
that this Cheesecake Factory in fact how

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,580
we ended up at this Cheesecake Factory

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,840
twice in the span of a week and I was

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,030
thinking about how the Cheesecake

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,800
Factory really does a great job of

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:38,000
illustrating how consensus

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,330
decision-making results in not bad but

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,060
certainly perhaps not our best

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,130
experiences from time to time and the

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,170
Cheesecake Factory also represents a

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,330
kind of diversity where there are

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,820
hundreds of things on the menu but in

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,470
fact they are all also just starch and

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,030
butter with different amounts of salt

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,970
added depending on your personal tastes

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,670
and so that there is a certain amount of

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,390
diversity of Cheesecake Factory as well

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,160
you know I feel like that's an

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,890
interesting take but the reason we wound

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,360
up there was not consensus it's because

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,760
we were trapped in a blizzard at a

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,440
conference and it was the only place we

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,239
could go to eat that is not true there

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,220
was a PF chance okay okay what we ate

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,660
there too we ate there too so there were

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,010
two places we could eat and we - both of

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,510
them yeah but we need a cheesecake

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,920
factory twice because of consensus

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,230
decision-making we're just gonna have to

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,170
agree to agree to disagree

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,489
fine fine oh wait no no you forgot about

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,260
the part where we don't talk on behalf

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,780
of our employers because this is one of

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,430
those things right yeah yeah don't take

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,200
what I say to represent Google's views

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,100
here but definitely if you like them

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,450
give my employer money okay so most of

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,890
our slides are not going to have lots of

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,120
text for you to read

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,360
we just think there's some interesting

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,670
historical perspective that's useful to

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:55,550
mention so the first is actually from a

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:57,200
story about women at Newsweek having to

00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,540
sue to become writers it's a very famous

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,390
court case in the 70s and here's a

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,650
quotation from someone who was a asked

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,730
about at the time it said basically no

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,909
women are actually interested in

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,409
becoming writers

00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,329
if people were interested in being

00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,639
writers they would come to us and that

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,980
clearly was not true because there were

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,440
something like fifty people in that

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,630
court case before they before they won

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,729
it's interesting to look at some current

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,870
things that we see like people saying I

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:25,199
never work with women they weren't

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,449
interested in working this project the

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,490
many people actually believe that but we

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:34,509
know that there's often lots of interest

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:37,380
it may go on to reported curiously

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:41,080
enough there were some studies done by

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,449
on github laws and by some others with

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,039
some curious statistics like if you're

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,250
or if you reveal that you're a woman

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:52,349
when you have commits to push it is less

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:55,860
likely to be accepted another is that

00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,970
women report a much higher degree of

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,000
being exposed to language they're

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,070
uncomfortable with and content they

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,960
don't like and chat discussion groups

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,940
and mailing lists and one of the things

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,500
we're looking for is if we pull actual

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,449
data and do some science do we see

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,699
correlations between participation and

00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:14,680
what people actually report is

00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,979
problematic but we do know statistically

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,199
from these samples this seems to be more

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:23,409
of an issue for for women or according

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,530
to these studies so we we did some

00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:29,070
things that with one is drunk you could

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,070
call science

00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,099
we pulled data from a bunch of different

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,410
sources most of the data that we pulled

00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:38,560
was mailing list and data from different

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,720
git repos to look at commits and also

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,569
mailing list posts and sentiment

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,250
analysis and things like this the mo

00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:48,610
magic we can disagree on that one

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,199
apparently right well we agree on some

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,960
things

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,610
cheesecake okay fine

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,419
and since it's Jupiter can we use

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,889
Jupiter but yeah we also looked at

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:01,900
Jupiter was one of the projects that we

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,419
looked at as well as interact as well

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,009
but don't worry I assure you that in

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,270
amongst all of the Petri projects you

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,620
can't actually see it on any of the

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,690
graphs cool okay

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,159
some quick disclaimers thinks you won't

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,509
be able to get from this it's not

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,220
necessarily academic quality data

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,969
because of the size of the data loss

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,860
variable pulp it's not legal advice and

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:25,479
while we can identify some strong

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,270
correlations obviously that's not the

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,830
same as causation so it's important to

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,990
remember that and to be clear if you

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,880
attempt to use any of this in a court of

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,130
law or as legal advice lawyer cat will

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:44,500
destroy you with their laser eye beams

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:48,219
yeah okay so data sources and methods we

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:52,000
pulled from git commit logs project

00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:54,430
websites and mailing lists and we

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,639
inferred the gender using some basic ml

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:01,029
techniques and then also had some

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:04,029
sampling done by people yeah to validate

00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:06,130
a subset as someone who's a inferred

00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,080
gender from from like the computer

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,120
systems does not match my own gender I

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,650
thought it was interesting and important

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,539
to include a second data set as well

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,759
with humans and humans of course bring

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:18,069
their own biases we'll talk about that

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,360
later but we have essentially two

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,159
different ways of trying to guess the

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,819
gender of the participants in the open

00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,819
source projects

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,200
okay so there are 50 top level ASF

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,990
projects about 30 gigs that are active

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,820
active 30 gigs of commits and posts and

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:43,390
we were able to use in our data mining

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:46,220
and then within that we had using we do

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,290
about 1600 code contributors out of the

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,740
15 and a half thousand or so in total

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,980
and all 2,600 committers we had humans

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,870
try and validate independently as a way

00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,940
to validate the model we have the the

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,260
sample sizes were chosen based on my

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,870
corporate credit card limit without

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:09,350
review which is 500 dollars so we spent

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:11,180
400 $99.95 on data collection that but

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,220
it is actually a statistically

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,260
significant sample we did it

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,700
segmented per active project and writes

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,840
it's not it wasn't just cost savings so

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,120
let's talk about how the project

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,300
actually went it's like almost anything

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,980
else you do with analytics this the

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,440
first stage is to pull some data do some

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,840
simple graphs and eyeball to see what

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,229
you can find out so that's actually what

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,900
we did so what do a SF and two projects

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,169
look like hold well there's there's a

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,700
variety of projects also so this is

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,930
since it's the first graph we showed I

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,360
thought it would be important to not

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,790
make it with Jupiter and so this is done

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,170
inside of Google sheets and I'm sorry

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,300
but I needed the aggregate data and it

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,440
just happened to be there faster we can

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,960
see there's a bunch of projects with

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,120
sort of no like no women are

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,800
participating in them and that's

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,800
unfortunate there they're not all just

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,440
small projects httpd is one of them I

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,300
think for for active contributors but we

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,410
can see that they all sort of cluster

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,840
around 0.1 ish and there's a fair amount

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,610
of variability but we have one exciting

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,470
outlier which either means we have a

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,660
data quality issue or we have an

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,130
exciting project and the nice thing

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,050
about this is this is the samples human

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,700
data and doing it with the gender

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,100
inference also gave us a pretty similar

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,500
number for that project so I was more

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,540
confident it wasn't just a data quality

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,190
issue was actually something interesting

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,339
or or as you say

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,470
hey well it's okay you can see that the

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,060
participation rates vary a lot oh so

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,339
some of them are as low as do we want to

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,720
do questions and talk about this before

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,500
hands yeah we have a section for

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,000
questions at the end but we could okay

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,730
so we're going to disagree okay I guess

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,060
that means we'll take the question yeah

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,589
yeah it is actually a series yes the

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,220
label is wrong okay sure

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:03,920
sorry yeah no um this was this was yeah

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,660
the Google sheets

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,060
I shouldn't fix that before we upload

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,379
the slides but I probably won't yeah

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,790
I'll just had to add a note at the

00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,550
bottom it's only someone had said

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:16,129
something about that beforehand I'm fine

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,839
right so yes those are point six is 60%

00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,540
we should have clarified that when I

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,819
pulled this up but the the rates are

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,680
very from you know small single-digit

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:26,089
percentage numbers to about 20 percent

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,449
there's a fair amount of variability and

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:31,339
then there's one really tall bar which

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:34,670
we thought we'd look at or to use the

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:38,899
data science term more formally hey

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:41,360
what's that tall bar so we looked it up

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,519
and it's a project called airavata which

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,139
we weren't familiar with either it turns

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,649
out to be a distributed computing

00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,810
monitoring tool often used with cloud

00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,850
projects yeah I I think I just made that

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,750
up when we were talking but they're not

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,670
true cuz I went to the website

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,939
independently and it did say cloud no I

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,589
didn't believe so well that's what so

00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,910
that's what this tall bar is and it's

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,339
clearly an outlier and we're wondering

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,019
well let's take a first crack at you

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:09,139
know why is it an outlier and see if

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:11,509
there are any reasons so again this is

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,480
just superficial looking to see what do

00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:16,310
we find out and the things we noticed

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,130
it's an academic funded project from the

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,540
NSF they're staking a huge base of

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,630
companies that have actually funded it

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,250
and there's it's very easy to see how to

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,160
get involved and find the community page

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,110
right from the page you go to so maybe

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,550
those things are relevant obviously it's

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,319
a small statistical size so we don't

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,000
really know but part of what we're

00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,620
looking for is what things or stronger

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,450
correlations but this is what we saw

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,740
from

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,450
eyeballing you have anything to add to

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,690
that no okay none whatsoever

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,850
no yeah still no okay cool so then we

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,460
move on from eyeballing to the stage to

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,910
which we call second sciency ish

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,820
inspired in science inspired right where

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,800
we actually pull more data yeah and so

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,280
we looked at a number of project

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,740
attributes and so in addition to you

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,300
know finding the percentages of

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,070
contributors we also wanted to know what

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,210
things were correlated with them and

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,170
some of these are things that we didn't

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,570
bother doing because they're in out of

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,070
time but we we did look to see if

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,440
projects had code of conducts and how

00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,640
easy they were to find if there's a

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,310
stated way for people to become

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,070
committers and in yes I've speak

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:23,560
committer is someone who can commit code

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,630
to it without review normally there's

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,000
slight variations in review then commit

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,230
and then commit them review projects but

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,530
it's essentially like a position of

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,030
respect and authority and you know

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,340
they're often the people you go to with

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,810
tricky questions and if the project has

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,730
a contributing guy because we saw that

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,380
one project with the high percentage of

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,660
contributors had a really easily defined

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,130
contributing guide and what the

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,480
sentiment on the project user

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:51,280
development list is and this is my my my

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,500
belief is that perhaps negative

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,150
sentiment so people being very negative

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,860
towards each other might turn off

00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,990
different groups of people at different

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,100
rates and this could be one of the

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,320
things that could be correlated with

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,900
with a project not having great

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,220
diversity and PR acceptance right we

00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,610
didn't actually look at but another

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,930
study did that one and we would also

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,880
love your suggestions like it's a

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,150
notebook we can add more things to our

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,200
list to study pretty easily or you can

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,970
with a pull request because I am lazy

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,140
according to my performance okay moving

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:29,740
on what and to be fair you actually the

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:32,440
notebooks are available on all of them

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,700
and it well was set up in here to run on

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,940
the cloud it does run on a single

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,920
machine if it has 30 gigs of memory

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,510
yeah I think we can make it smaller but

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,490
if you have 30 gigs of memory on your

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,320
machine it can run right as soon as I

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,870
upload the instructions yeah just just

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,550
just use the cloud and let that gives my

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,840
employer money okay and so in addition

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,370
to those like these were some of the

00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,950
things we were gonna look at and see if

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,960
they were correlated the idea is gender

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,970
percentage of code contributors and PMC

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,250
slash committers essentially the project

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,340
management group and I meant to do it

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:09,030
for mailing lists but then the sample

00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,560
sizes exceeded my budget of for $99.99

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,290
and so that's gonna have to be saved for

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,530
future work also known as Holden's next

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:21,220
expenses submission cycle which is very

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,690
soon and we'll follow up on that so we

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,970
actually pulled this we've pulled this

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,010
data and did the correlations and pull

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,020
them up and got some results actually

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,340
inside of inside of Jupiter yeah inside

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,110
Noah which is renowned for

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:36,550
naturalization so would you guys like to

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:39,910
take a look great okay so here was our

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:42,220
it was the first thing we pulled and we

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,990
looked at this for a while and thought

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,840
you know maybe our eyeballing method is

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,760
not as good on this one so we can make

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,830
some minor change minor minor minor

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,480
changes right and produce a better slide

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,310
but I want to be clear this is also this

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,190
is the default view for the data frame

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,870
when you collected back to your

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,150
localhost so this is this is the default

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,460
view that you get right and it's it's

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,470
really as we can see an excellent view -

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,450
all right so now that we're lobbying for

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,550
a different default no not a networker

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:13,840
so we didn't pull this again and you

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:16,150
guys want to see that great okay much

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,160
better and so this is much better this

00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,600
is the show method which you know

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,720
implies that this is how you would want

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,270
to look at your data

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,640
yeah so here we have a long list of

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,990
numbers we thought well you know we can

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,270
look at this a little bit but maybe we

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,760
want some pictures so we actually pulled

00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:36,180
this up and did some some we plot it

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,860
together yeah and it came up we started

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,830
with these two slides no wait

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:44,160
yeah the labels are too dense to read on

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,900
these slides was we break them out in a

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,670
little more detail but this is a show

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,850
the correlations of essentially gender

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:55,980
but just participation against a series

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,750
of variables we pulled and we said I

00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,740
mentioned before some of this is from

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,870
the notebook and some of this was

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,740
validated independently by humans on

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,570
Mechanical Turk and we wanted to know do

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,520
they actually agree for the most part

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,840
and for the most part they do although

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,090
there's one problem which we actually

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,800
think is our fault which you and I

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,330
disagree as to the source of that

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,740
problem I think it's your fault but okay

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:21,600
all right so moving on and we we took a

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,160
little bit about differences and when we

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,210
were looking at differences we wanted to

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,190
attempt to validate some of the

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,650
methodologies we used like let's

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,080
double-check the sentiment analysis from

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:34,440
the logs actually pulled and let's look

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,210
at the gender inference so there's

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,720
there's a few things that that could be

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,580
wrong

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,070
infer gender is known to have issues

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,220
right this is not surprising it infers

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,840
my gender is male it probably actually

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,090
doesn't have a great inference for booze

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,180
gender either it does pretty okay on

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,920
Matt but and it has an American bias

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,480
because there's census data and and

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,890
lovely things there so it could be a

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,940
problem with our gender inference which

00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,980
could explain why we're getting

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,110
different results from these two it

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,550
could also be that maybe our sentiment

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,350
detection isn't so great because the one

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,630
that's varying between the two is the

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,120
sentiment analysis so I spot-checked it

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,650
like a good engineer I'm not legally

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,689
allowed to call myself that in Canada

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,780
but sample-sized here in America yeah

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,189
sample size of to size I didn't quite

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,220
get to engineers induction which is

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:22,130
three but we're pretty close and so I

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,240
want to read these these two quotes

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,819
Thanks I think it still needs a bit more

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,620
work but that had no negative sentiment

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,260
and was mostly positive and the other

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,160
one is who broke the bills and

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,050
that had the large

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,330
negative sentiment and no positive

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,040
sentiment and so for my my sample of two

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,310
I think that our sentiment detection is

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,530
probably world class and I don't want to

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,980
look for three elements because that

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:51,640
could disprove my theory and that would

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,200
use induction yeah yeah and so the human

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,080
data collection this is the question we

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,000
asked them if you find something wrong

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,130
with this maybe you actually do real

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,190
things with collecting human data please

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,490
let us know and next billing cycle I can

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:11,800
ask people the question again but that's

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:14,770
yeah okay so here's a look at some of

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,200
the actual data and the results we got

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,020
we circled a couple of things to explain

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,970
what's actually there so the blue circle

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,000
in the lower right is actually

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,220
correlation between what the code came

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,320
up with with what humans detected so

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,700
it's above 0.8 which means they have a

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,800
strong correlate but strong positive

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,870
correlation so for the most part our

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,180
software results agree with what people

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,960
came up with independently relatively

00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,310
across the board

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,400
with the notable exception which we'll

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:47,340
discuss later on the second thing is if

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:53,410
you look the green circle is a set of

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:56,710
attributes tied to the sentiment in main

00:18:53,410 --> 00:19:00,430
groups and essentially positive

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:02,950
sentiment strongly correlates with

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,660
increased gender participation so we

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,390
actually broke this out into quartiles

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,890
and buckets and worst which is why

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,570
there's more than one point but you can

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:14,440
see they're all positive in the green

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:16,240
and also on the left side the ones in

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,530
red are negative sentiments and

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:23,020
according to this the negative comments

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,570
in a negative sentiment in the main

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,190
group seems to strongly correlate with

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,640
lessened gender diversity which is kind

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,890
of interesting

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,600
again our sample size is in the few

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,900
dozens of gigabytes for these 50

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,910
projects we're not saying

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,740
correlation and causation the same but

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,410
it's an interesting result that agrees

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,180
with some other studies done previously

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,220
we also found some things we were

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,080
actually confused by which is actually

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,900
the stuff well more than one thing but

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,990
on this slide anyway the the bit in

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:55,320
yellow actually says that if you have a

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:58,140
if a mentoring guide exists there's a

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,270
negative correlation it's not a strong

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,190
negative correlation it could easily be

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,020
a side-effect of the relatively small

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,640
number of projects right because there

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,340
are only 50 data points for that

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,890
whereas sentiment across you know

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:15,179
gigabyte yeah it's much more reliable

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:17,210
but it's sort of interesting so diving

00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,620
diving more into the mailing list posts

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,140
we can see that the the positive

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,330
sentiment Max and an average are both

00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,860
positively correlated and that's what I

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,140
expected and so that's kind of happy and

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,460
it makes me makes me feel good when when

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,230
I get the answers I was expecting

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,340
although that also is somewhat

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,080
questionable because that's the point

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,800
which I stopped investigating any data

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,450
correctness issues so who knows and we

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,250
can see that you know it doesn't really

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,170
make a big difference between the

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,270
different quantiles that we measure that

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,380
at one of the things which i think is

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,480
really interesting for the negative

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,510
sentiment is you can see here we have

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,940
the positive sediment max described but

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,280
the negative sentiment max was not

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,429
greater than it was not less than

00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,760
negative 0.2 so it wasn't relevant it

00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:04,890
was closer to the zero mark and so your

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,540
average negative sentiment and your your

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,580
90th percentile negative sentiment

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,010
matters but you know you don't have to

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,600
worry necessarily about that one post to

00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:16,470
the mailing list that's like by that one

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,720
 but it does seem to say like if

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,820
10% of your posts to your mailing list

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,220
are by who are being jerks to

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,750
people that's not a good sign so you

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,190
should probably still deal with

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,320
when they show up on your mailing list

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,760
posts before it gets out of hand but

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,429
don't worry that like one person is

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,400
going to completely screw you over and

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:38,670
yeah that's pretty much it for this one

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,530
and so the rest one of the things which

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,620
I was also happy to see is that the

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,360
percentage of non mail committers was

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,429
positively correlated with the

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,399
percentage of

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:52,220
non-male contributors this is not overly

00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:56,119
surprising certainly sometimes I will go

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,879
to projects web page look at the list of

00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:01,369
contributors and see a distinct lack of

00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:03,649
dinosaurs and then I'm like whoa there

00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:05,330
are no other dinosaurs here I'm just

00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:07,570
gonna go and find a more dinosaur

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,460
friendly project for me to contribute to

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,840
and and so this is not too surprising

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,730
and that's that's kind of cool

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,649
the committer guide existing being

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,830
weakly negatively correlated this could

00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:20,509
just be you know that that data point we

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,299
only have a sample of 50 it could also

00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:25,039
be that you add your committer guide for

00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:26,330
example in response to realizing that

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,789
you don't have a lot of diverse

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,009
committers you know and that could be a

00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,990
thing we can come up with all kinds of

00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,340
different explanations to fit our data

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,509
but it's more fun to do with a throw

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,460
around and I think there's another side

00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:43,659
oh yeah and so let's let's talk about

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,419
the inferred data and why it made me sad

00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:49,100
so I mean the the non-male committer

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,950
percentage still was positively

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,830
correlated here we have the positive

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,960
sentiment being negatively correlated

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,779
and we we disagree as to the likely

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,950
cause of this you think it's that we

00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,619
just don't have enough samples and

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:06,440
that's that's definitely quite possible

00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:13,639
I think that it could be that there's

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:16,129
issues with how well the gender

00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:19,309
inference works especially affecting

00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:23,090
perhaps more marginalized communities

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:25,460
could be more impacted by the problems

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,559
with gender inference and that could

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,600
skew our dataset but it's alright we

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,830
agreed to disagree and just share this

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,480
with you all so you can make your own

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,950
decisions and then we didn't have to

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,840
have that cage match in the speaker's

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,330
room because there just was not enough

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,330
room yeah

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,330
okay great okay so you know you just

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,850
assumed that I wrote the code wrong

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,259
which is also equally possible I I

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,999
should have pointed that out I thought

00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,820
you just thought our data set was not

00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:55,649
very good which could be quite right so

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,619
we started out with looking at some

00:23:55,649 --> 00:24:00,989
historical challenges in other

00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:02,759
industries and and the parallels and the

00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:05,610
quotes were perhaps a little on the nose

00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,769
when one could say and they they did a

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,049
bunch of interesting things I was really

00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:12,869
hoping that we would see a relationship

00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,519
with things like the committer guide or

00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,320
Contributor guide being much stronger

00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,210
because that resembled some of the

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,409
solutions that were done where they made

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,809
explicit training our mentorship

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:25,710
programs and stopped just hiring their

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:28,710
friends but that wasn't correlated at

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,720
all there was a thing you wanted to say

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,970
here I don't remember what it was so

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,470
it's gonna go back to you well a lot of

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,940
these are actually historical challenges

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,989
waited to the earlier court cases and

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,999
it's sort of interesting question of if

00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:43,649
you want to increase participation what

00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:45,690
should you do we don't have any magical

00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,549
answers but some a lot of what we did

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,700
here seems to agree with some earlier

00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:52,139
studies and empathize the tone on the

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,220
mailing list and sentiment certainly

00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:57,539
seems to be important and we can also

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,149
see there are definitely a wildly

00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:02,279
varying rates and so and groups have

00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:03,899
been more successful and so it's

00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,899
interesting to find out what what else

00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,940
can be done because we know that some

00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:10,289
sometimes people say well there are

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,669
people there aren't women interested

00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:15,119
this project for example and that's

00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:18,179
probably not true yeah just a slide here

00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:21,929
there are both some related projects and

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,980
also links to places where we pull the

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,590
quotations from earlier if you're

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,200
interested in reading more one of them

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:31,289
someone did gender diversity analysis in

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:35,159
the Linux kernel across time which also

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:38,789
has some interesting data points you can

00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,519
see the increase of rate of commits by

00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:44,220
women over time going back to I think

00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:47,129
2006 I didn't read the links yeah okay

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:51,380
someone's Dera homework right he's

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:53,390
making my notebook oh sure yeah so

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,680
it doesn't actually show you as a

00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,720
percentage unfortunately it's just

00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,950
absolute number of commits now so

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,300
they're actually you know this was

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,910
obviously a lot of fun for us to work on

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,930
but there's some really interesting

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,030
potential follow-ups that other people

00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,200
could do like analysis analyzing how

00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,270
does this actually change over time

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,960
right we have 50 projects but this could

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:14,390
also be broadened out and the there are

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,480
live streams of the pulling of the data

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:20,330
or on and doing processing and of course

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,590
links to the notebook which will

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,850
actually provide up a little bit

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:28,220
something you can run on a single

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:30,020
machine well I'll make it work just by a

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,110
glaring sense I you forgot about the

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,050
part oh come on man you can't skip that

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,480
part and I'll go ahead you go for it

00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,620
it's way less okay fine so anyway

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,110
there's a link here to the data

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,840
processing and collection and you know

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,040
you guys may not know this I mean I did

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,940
but it's actually turns out its

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:52,040
performance season at Google and I'm not

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,270
also I mean you probably don't know this

00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,090
but there are actually very metrics

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,440
driven and you know actually this is a

00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,150
strain I don't have rights my managers

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,320
name is not Steve let me enter his

00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,520
name's not Steve I don't know whose I

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,710
don't know whose manager's name is Steve

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,300
in Seattle if you happen to know a Steve

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:09,350
working out of Google Seattle who

00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:11,240
manages you know DA's just so there's a

00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,590
link to the live streams if you want to

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,300
watch if you want to watch them or or

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:21,230
even watch them on loop right yeah oh

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:25,580
yeah so we'd like to express a special

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:27,830
thanks to aunt Spencer yeah so um well

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,310
Matt was busy in New York and Spencer

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,960
and I met a lot early on with some of

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,970
the collection and figuring out things

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
that we were going to poke at with

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:39,470
seeing what things might be correlated

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,210
she's the Wrangler of cats and unicorns

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,020
as the head of content at Domino data

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:47,570
lab and we first worked together on my

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:50,690
first O'Reilly book together and she's

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,940
amazing and without her this this

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,520
notebook would just be like six things

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,500
that I kind of thought of well drunk as

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,149
opposed to like semi organized and

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,569
actually

00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:02,049
maybe being useful and so this is this

00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:05,079
is good

00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:07,239
and you couldn't read her blog I think

00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:09,009
Domino data lab is also a very metrics

00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:10,839
driven company so if you wanted to you

00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:12,969
know read her blog several times a day I

00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,829
don't think she would object in any way

00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:18,569
shape or form yeah she was very helpful

00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:18,569
in outlining a number of ideas for this

00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:25,209
what she had the Cheesecake Factory with

00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:26,949
us yes she was okay not at the time when

00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:30,429
we actually came up with the talk okay

00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:33,189
the second time second time the

00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:34,239
Cheesecake Factory is indeed key so if

00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:36,179
anyone's interested in participating

00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:39,339
we've actually set up a few things

00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,109
there's a form that we just created if

00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:43,809
anyone wants to discuss this completely

00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:45,969
empty so um well very neutral tournament

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:47,859
but right and the notebook

00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:50,199
here's a link to be able to access the

00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:53,169
notebook and the bitly link may produce

00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:56,019
metrics if you were figuring which link

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:58,359
to click on you know and these slides

00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:59,649
are also posted and these are our

00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:02,229
twitter handles or you can come by and

00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:03,639
talk to us here or at strata or yeah

00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:07,349
you're going to strata right yeah I'll

00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:10,719
go that's it's here I'll go okay cool

00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:12,159
yeah and so completely unrelated to this

00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:15,549
talk but that should not stop you from

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,079
buying several copies of this book one

00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:18,549
of my or I'll ebooks is called high

00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,519
performance spark this is the one where

00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,019
I found out you can negotiate royalties

00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,549
and so I encourage you to buy several

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,429
copies with your corporate credit card

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,019
if you don't have a corporate credit

00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:31,359
card and you want a free copy there's

00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:33,609
there's a book signing at 3:20 and even

00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,019
if you do have a corporate credit card

00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:38,589
come by and get us signed one and then

00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:39,759
we can you know also buy many copies

00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:40,179
online with your corporate credit card

00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,699
later

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:46,059
I just don't return them it creates a

00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:48,369
hassle and cats do love it mostly the

00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:54,399
box it comes in but that should not stop

00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:56,739
you from buying it oh just just buy this

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,120
just okay yeah so you'd go get your copy

00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:01,019
sign and it's 3:20

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,279
so we had a lot of fun putting this

00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:07,409
together any questions oh if you could

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,059
pretend that you're happy I can take a

00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,309
picture of you all being happy and

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:17,010
clapping from my boss if you could just

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:18,240
do that again I'm sorry thank you so

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:22,380
much thank you

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,779
it is perf season it opened yesterday do

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,679
we mention it's per season for old sure

00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:32,279
thank you

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:34,080
any questions yes so for the inference

00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,039
us of the question is was gender

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,870
inferred for the name and for the

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,990
inference one yeah I was just done from

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:42,899
the name which is why it has all of

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,669
these problems with just depending on

00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:47,340
name data from US Census data for

00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:52,789
determining gender that's that's a great

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,789
question yes

00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:00,120
oh great so as do I use an API for the

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,760
name and the answer is I tried two

00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,900
different things there was a library

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,900
which just shipped with some pretty big

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:13,740
data set and for the name one I also

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,570
looked at using gender eyes and that

00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,940
returned to null less often so that's

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,220
the one that I went with it also told

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,230
you the sample sizes and stuff so you

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,910
could discard low sample sizes if that's

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:27,420
the thing that would matter for for your

00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:30,930
work and so that that one might be

00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,700
better they want money but again less

00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,950
than the five hundred dollars so we're

00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,020
good but we found that they're pretty

00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,790
good and they agree pretty well with

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,310
what people came up with independently

00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,470
yeah oh can we bring their own biases

00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:45,810
well sure so one of the issues is which

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,370
biases come in to which data set so a

00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:48,510
lot what we found is over for a lot of

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,980
the name detection they tend to be

00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:56,960
biased towards Western names much more

00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,960
and so that can cause its own skew yes

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:14,860
oh yeah that's great question yep

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:18,480
totally and so yeah we actually also

00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:24,100
cracked we trekked male female and and B

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:29,679
and also null we discarded nulls but we

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:32,020
kept envy the humans found one which was

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,059
sad but also perhaps reveals some amount

00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,450
of human bias with assigning genders to

00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:39,730
two people you can read the text as a

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,340
question and if you're if you're so

00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,330
inclined from my from my SlideShare and

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,220
see if maybe there was a way we could

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,850
have phrased it better to to get them to

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:52,750
more accurately correctly identify MB

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:54,429
folk but yeah they're in there but there

00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,929
was only one entry and so I didn't call

00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:58,480
it out separately on all of the graphs I

00:32:55,929 --> 00:33:05,900
just grouped it together with women for

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:08,800
now as non-male cool any other questions

00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:12,710
great thank you for coming

00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,710
