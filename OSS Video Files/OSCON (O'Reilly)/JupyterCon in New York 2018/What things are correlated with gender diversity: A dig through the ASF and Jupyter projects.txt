	What things are correlated with gender diversity: A dig through the ASF and Jupyter projects
Holden Karau (Google), Matt Hunt (Bloomberg)

Many of us believe that gender diversity in open source projects is important (for example, O’Reilly, Google, and the Python Software Foundation). (If you don’t, this isn’t going to convince you.) But what things are correlated with improved gender diversity, and what can we learn from similar historic industries?

Holden Karau and Matt Hunt explore the diversity of different projects, examine historic EEOC complaints, and detail parallels and historic solutions. To keep things interesting, Holden and Matt conclude with a comparative analysis of the state of OSS and various complaints handled by the EEOC in the ’60s, along with the solutions, suggestions, and binding settlements that were reached for similar diversity problems in other industries. This comparison is not legal advice but rather examples of what we can learn from early equal opportunity commission decisions.

Topics include:

Diversity of gender among the different levels of a given project’s leadership (committers, PMC, etc.)
The existence of codes of conduct
Language used in comments, code, and mailing lists
The rate of promotions for project participants
