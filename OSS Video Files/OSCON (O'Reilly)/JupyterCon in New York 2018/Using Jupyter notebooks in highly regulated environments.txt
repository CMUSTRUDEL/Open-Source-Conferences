all right so it's an absolute pleasure

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,620
to be here today to talk about this

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,120
subject I know this is a kind of a

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,129
subject when we talk about regulations

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,869
that can make people's eyes glaze over

00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,820
so hopefully we can make this a little

00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,779
bit more interesting today and really

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,710
there's three things that we're going to

00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,390
cover during the course of this

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,679
presentation the first thing is we're

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,300
going to talk about the increase in

00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,740
regulations and how it's a kind of a

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,169
growing problem that we need to continue

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,119
to be aware of at the same time there's

00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:28,529
benefits to regulation and how it

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,359
applies to the data in analytics space

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,800
so we like to talk a little bit about

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,719
what those benefits are as well

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,969
and then finally how you can leverage

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,199
Jupiter is a hub they help you manage

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,510
these regulations and ensure that

00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:40,770
everybody that's using Jupiter kind of

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,120
complies with the things that you need

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,770
to focus on and things like that as well

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,690
but before we get started let's

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,640
introduce ourselves first and Roger yeah

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,590
hey I'm Raj I've been with Capital One

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,269
about a year my background is product

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,199
management I did a stint in consulting

00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:57,090
but then mostly in tech other than that

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,440
you know my time at Capital One lead a

00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,460
couple different projects on the data

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,250
side but one of the ones that

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,780
specifically here is lead the the tools

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,570
that we from product management the

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,920
tools that we do within one division of

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,190
Capital One and what tools people can

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,360
use to do their own analysis and my name

00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,400
is David Sheff and I've been with

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,710
Capital One for 10 years I primarily

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,090
been focused on data throughout my

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,610
career regardless if there was been a

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,500
Capital One or elsewhere and then been

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,970
in data analyst roles business analyst

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,370
roles and in engineering roles as well

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,720
and currently I lead up the engineering

00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,320
teams that focus on building these

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,660
products that Rogers mentioned as well

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,070
so the reality is that regulations of

00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,870
skyrocketed and they continue to

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,210
increase if you just go back a few

00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,130
decades and you look at 1970 the Code of

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,630
Federal Regulations which actually kind

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,370
of contained all the information about

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,710
what regulations are out there has

00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,490
increased from 400,000 regulations to

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,470
1.1 million as of 2016 and the reality

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,140
is that during the course of that time

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,690
each year there's about 200 to 300

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,790
significant significant regular final

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,140
rules and these are basically defined as

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,780
rules that have an impact on the economy

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,490
of 100 million dollars or more where

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,340
they have an impact on other regulatory

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,959
agencies as well and while these are not

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,220
increased these are the type of things

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,230
that that really get

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,120
enterprise organizations in smaller

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,050
organizations concerned because of the

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,900
impact that they have on those

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,970
organizations in addition you have the

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,830
cost the substantial financial cost as

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,870
it related to these the Mercatus

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,970
Institute at George Mason University did

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,250
a study a few years back and found that

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,230
US regulation has caused the cost about

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,900
four trillion dollars out of the US GDP

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,850
so roughly about six twenty five percent

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,600
of the sixteen point two billion dollar

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:43,300
told our trillion dollar total GDP in

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,800
addition to that back in 2012 there was

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,510
a study that was done this show that

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,900
there are roughly about ten thousand

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,370
dollars of cost per employee that for a

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,570
company regardless of what size it is

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,370
and of course they can vary a little bit

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,140
but you can see that this is a real

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,360
estate a relatively standard number

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,209
across all of these different areas so

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,190
with this in mind if men and if we

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,620
manage regulation as well they can have

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,209
some positive impacts and that's one of

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,350
the things that I really think we all

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,030
need to kind of take a step back and

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,410
think about they're there for a reason

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,000
and there's a reason that regulations

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,560
came into play in the first place the

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,019
first thing is it drives unassailable

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,360
practices that means that it ensures

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,860
that everybody is kind of kind of doing

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,110
doing things in the right way and

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,370
thinking about the public good as they

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,320
work through and do the work that

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,510
they're doing the second thing is it

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,950
levels the playing field and the reality

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,050
is that sometimes there's bad actors in

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,940
the marketplace the marketplace is

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,070
driven by profit is driven by investors

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,480
and the the unfortunate thing is

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,860
sometimes that can lead people to make

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,750
choices and decisions that they shared

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,489
and made in the first place so this way

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,950
we can ensure that people are doing

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,940
playing by the same rules and that way

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,920
that if you have somebody that's

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,140
actually a good company and that is

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,610
doing things the right way then they can

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,390
also compete and not be at a competitive

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,250
disadvantage

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,430
and then that one handful Roger finally

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,810
it also balances the market

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,459
accountability and the thing about

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,010
regulation is yes on the one hand you

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,180
want to be regulated and you to protect

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,820
our consumers to protect or end

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,130
consumers and in fact you know like many

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,330
banks we especially we actually draw our

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,950
envelope on what it means to be

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,980
regulated even much broader than what

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,810
the government requires but that being

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,810
said regulation actually has a positive

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,950
market impact as well people trust us

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,950
with their money they trust us with our

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,950
loans being well regulated and making

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,600
that a critical part of

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,550
and is actually a big reason why people

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,260
actually trust and use Capital One and

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,550
we don't want to and we want to be very

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,830
sensitive and very serious about that

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,690
that trusted people hooded us so not

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,510
only is it a thing necessary to protect

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,630
the public good we actually also find

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,820
that being well regulated makes us gives

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,710
us a competitive advantage there have

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,540
been there I'm not naming names but

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,980
their bid banks where there have been

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,310
some issues with their regulations and

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,720
with certain compliance issues and we

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,130
actually it's actually benefited us

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,890
because then customers are coming to us

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:02,990
because Trust is a huge part of what why

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,790
they even use our company so the reality

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,040
is regulations also have very real

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,500
implications in the analytics space so

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,330
first of all data must always be right

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,710
and securely managed and there's quite a

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,050
few regulations that are out there the

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,140
governess if you think about GPD are

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,030
from from a European Union standpoint or

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,520
more locally if you think of things like

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,380
sarbanes-oxley these even government

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,150
things such as data classification and

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,520
how you can share data between different

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,950
groups and so that becomes an important

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,240
factor or what you need to consider when

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,800
you build out things like your data

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,450
infrastructure where you're sharing data

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,830
between users of the company that you

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,130
work at or the organization that you

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,740
work at as well the second thing is how

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,950
you got the answer matters and the

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,720
reality is is that when you when you if

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,220
you're a highly regulated industry then

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,690
your regulators come in and they take a

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,880
look at what you're doing every solves

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,800
and it's important that you are able to

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,020
tell them these steps that you took and

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,940
how you got to the actual decisions that

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,410
you had in the first place and so in

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,290
order to do that you have to think about

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,820
how you can capture those things as

00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,650
folks that are using thing tools like

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,800
Jupiter are doing the work that they're

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,870
doing and finally you want to be able to

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,490
change and adapt very quickly not only

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,310
our regulations themselves changing you

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,500
have government changing you have things

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,240
happen that scare the public and

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,590
regulations change itself we all seem to

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,350
be able to adapt very quickly because

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,090
our business were in all our competitors

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,950
are not being very quickly so not only

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,650
do we have to maintain the regulations

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,390
to comply with regulations doing the

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,410
regula maintaining regulations and being

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,090
able to adapt very quickly it's a

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,290
critical part of being able to stay

00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,290
compliant and stay competitive

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,569
so with that in mind and there's some

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,789
things that you need to consider first

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,770
of all data governance becomes integral

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,240
to analyst work and I can tell you I've

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,879
been in a lot of experiences in the past

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,439
where actually collecting metadata

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,840
getting an understanding of what the

00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,639
data is is incredibly difficult and then

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,289
actually just managing people sharing

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,060
data between different organizations is

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:00,229
also incredibly difficult it's kind of

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,599
the thing that people really don't want

00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:04,580
to do but at the same time it's really

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,020
important that you actually do it and

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,000
the benefit is is I think the way that

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,699
you kind of sell this to folks that are

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,289
using your tools in your organization is

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,629
that it's actually beneficial to them as

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,819
well if you do it the right way and you

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:18,580
ensure that is as easy as possible for

00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,379
them to follow the rules that are there

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,349
then it also helps them have a better

00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,240
understanding of what data is there how

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,620
to use the data what is the right data

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,110
element and things like that that you

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,699
need to be using otherwise oftentimes

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,650
that is relegated to tribal knowledge

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,000
and you kind of have to know the person

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,129
that just happens to know the data or

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,539
find who that person is in order to be

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:42,469
able to really understand what you're

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,729
looking at how you get the answer also

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:47,360
matters because you need to keep track

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,979
of everything um it's it's especially in

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,930
our industry it's critical that you

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,250
can't just say well I wrote some model I

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,190
don't know how it works it's a black box

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,779
but that's great it I think some of

00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,849
those in financial might understand it's

00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,469
a black box that's great and this just

00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,229
gets us increasing market share it's

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,969
because we want to make sure as I said

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,529
before are not only is it to meet the

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,759
regulations but also for our brand image

00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,889
we want to make sure we are not

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,639
disadvantaging a population we want to

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,789
make sure we're not doing something that

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,439
despair just someone just because of

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,120
that we shouldn't we don't want to

00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,490
discriminate against right now an

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,629
algorithm might do that by itself might

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,610
come up with some reason where it does

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,839
something like that that's why we take a

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,099
lot of pains to actually make sure that

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,050
yes we use a lot of machine learning

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:33,339
models but we're also very careful that

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,599
we know how those things work so we know

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,169
whether we are actually doing things in

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,490
a good and just way given our population

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,620
regulations and meeting these

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:47,000
regulations help us make sure that we're

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,890
meeting these these standards and

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,300
finally analytic tools must be highly

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,519
resilient

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,810
and you know this is really the value of

00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,130
having an open source project and

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,019
leveraging something like that like

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,490
Jupiter because it gives you the

00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,950
capability to make changes in the way

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,660
that you need to at the previous talk

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,830
Brian Granger mentioned this is kind of

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,360
one of the things that's positive about

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,529
open source it can also be a negative as

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,420
well because sometimes open source

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,760
review slowly but you as an organization

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,440
if you have the resources behind it you

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,670
can make changes to Jupiter yourself and

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,160
potentially you can contribute those

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,570
things back also in addition to that is

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,860
really important to think about things

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,630
like continuous integration and

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,160
continuous delivery and ensure that you

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,200
have pipelines set up whether you're

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,880
developing a product or working on

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,350
something like Jupiter or you're trying

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,480
to do something around machine learning

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,769
that ensures that over time that is you

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,390
need to make changes and you need to

00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,190
iterate on what you're doing you can

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,750
quickly make those changes I'll just

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,690
take a pause for a second and tell quick

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,430
story so several years back I worked on

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,540
the Federal Reserve stressed hasn't one

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,290
what you need to do from the capital one

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,029
standpoint and I led the offer for our

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,920
financials for a home loans division of

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,839
financial services to actually put that

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,120
in place and we were doing that

00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,250
initially we kind of did some work and

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
to be very honest with you we did what

00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,240
we could do to get it done but then over

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,070
time what the challenge became is that

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,870
we have more and more changes come from

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,190
the Federal Reserve and they'd asked us

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,600
to implement things in a couple of

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,760
months period so we had to really think

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,709
about how can we actually do this in the

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,630
right and as quickly as possible and

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,890
then that comes into play making sure

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,200
that you have these type of things in

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,910
place so as your regulator is asked to

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,339
make changes or if they ask you to

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,930
respond back and to to something that

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,459
they're interested in knowing or finding

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:27,380
or something like that that you're able

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:29,720
to do that quickly as well all right so

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,790
why do these implications matter and how

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,990
do they show up so first of all let's

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,810
start with data governance becomes

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,620
integral panel it's work so first of all

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,850
I mentioned earlier data sharing and so

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,250
depending on the size organization

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,720
you're in this may not be as critical

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,490
but if you're in a very large

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,110
organization oftentimes you have

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,180
different legal entities within that

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,949
organization and you have to manage your

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,899
sharing across those legal entities and

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:55,519
there's restrictions on what you can

00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:57,949
share between one legal entity and

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,290
another so it's very important to kind

00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,970
of keep that in mind if you are not an

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,740
organization that has multiple legal

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,080
entities this is still something that

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,550
you have

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,350
to consider and be concerned about as

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,240
well because if you need to share with

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,370
another third party or something like

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,140
that also you also need to be thinking

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,060
about these things particularly if you

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,590
have personal information that you're

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,220
dealing with with somebody or something

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,370
like that

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,840
second is metadata and you know metadata

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,920
you know as I mentioned earlier it's

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,960
kind of one of those things that people

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,220
really don't want to focus on but the

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,680
truth of the matter is is that people

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,870
will people leave organizations you end

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,850
up if you're in a situation where you're

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,860
fortunate enough to share out datasets

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,600
to the public things like that this is

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,040
absolutely crucial to give an

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,260
understanding of how the data actually

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,610
works and it takes a lot of time and

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,020
it's not necessarily fun to sit there

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,030
and do the definitions around metadata

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,620
but it can pay big dividends in the long

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,680
run so something you really need to make

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,210
sure you focus on and finally quality so

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,280
the quality of the data that you have

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,100
the reality is is that junk that comes

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,630
in is just a produces junk that comes

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,150
out you know garbage in is garbage out

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,800
and the fact of the matter is is that

00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,290
you never know what's going to be coming

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,820
in sometimes there's changes and

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,020
downstream systems or where you're

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,430
getting something off of the public

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,050
Internet and somebody does something

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,060
through the data set that you're using

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,770
or something along those lines and so

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,760
you really have to keep this in mind as

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,220
something that you need to guard

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,930
yourself against so if you're part of an

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,210
organization particularly an enterprise

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,630
or even a medium-sized company it's

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:27,090
really important that you have quality

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,140
data quality reporting in place not just

00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,550
that you're checking it as you go along

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,890
but once you put something out there

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,390
you've done your analysis you found the

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,290
insight and now you're using it as

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,330
something that you're dealing on

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,680
operational basis you have to make sure

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,430
that you have this data quality checks

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,960
in place on a regular basis so you're a

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,490
decision-makers your executives whoever

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,920
else needs to see it has a really good

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,930
understanding of how the data is today

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,370
is it of the right quality are there

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,390
problems there are there anomalies that

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:56,280
he didn't expect so you keeping track of

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,390
everything again it it adds a lot of

00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,130
value so definitely we need to keep

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,750
track of everything so that we get

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,940
audited we have a tremendous number of

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,140
internal audits even Act we have to

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,820
satisfy certain external audits like the

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,140
stress test that David mentioned for all

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,180
that of course you have to keep you have

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,590
to keep track of everything but the

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,540
thing to keep in mind is this is not

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,680
actually like many people consider this

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,360
like a trade-off well if you keep track

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,100
of everything it's going to be burn

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,239
but we're actually finding that by

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,739
keeping track of everything we're

00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:22,199
actually doing better on our market side

00:13:19,739 --> 00:13:24,149
as well our strategy team our our

00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,379
marketing team is actually finding that

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,420
because they keep track of I think they

00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,089
have a much better idea of how our

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,259
various programs are going they have a

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:32,459
much better idea of how they can

00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,199
actually react to things

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,790
so being regulated is actually not so

00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,860
much a well you have to trade-off

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,540
regulation versus a versus of better

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,189
business results we're finding that

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,889
doing these things to be regulated

00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:45,779
actually also builds the case to have

00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:49,470
better business results also it's not a

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,699
or it's finding increasingly that there

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,720
are many many use cases where it's

00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,459
actually an end

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,809
yeah and just thought one more thing I

00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,309
would add to this I mean like you can

00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:58,769
track this type of stuff technically as

00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:01,259
well so you have a insulation of Jupiter

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,449
so for example that is central to your

00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,799
organization then you can log all the

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,329
things and the messages that are coming

00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,799
through the pipeline and that way you

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,329
have a way to actually go back and see

00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,220
what happens and from a technical

00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,689
perspective that also helps you resolve

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,819
issues and troubleshoot things that were

00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:17,100
going on I was in a presentation

00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:18,779
yesterday by Kyle Kelly from on Netflix

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,879
and they were talking about building on

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,649
top of protocols and you know underneath

00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,059
Jupiter there's all of these these

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:27,299
messages that are sent back and forth

00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,739
between 0 mq and Jupiter itself so

00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,509
that's something to consider as well

00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:31,410
just logging all that activity and

00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,119
making sure that you have an

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,589
understanding of what's going on so if

00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,480
you do need to go back and reconstruct

00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:37,889
something or you need to go back and

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,749
figure out what happened at a given time

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:42,149
you're able to actually do that actually

00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:43,139
on that note I want to go off message a

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,429
minute and actually talk about something

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,989
else David's team is doing relate to

00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:48,360
that that's really exciting they're

00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:50,009
actually even looking at like because

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,169
we're serving this as a service to

00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,119
everybody they are looking at how people

00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:55,319
are using notebooks so we actually sit

00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:57,540
down were able to look at how people use

00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:58,860
notebooks we're able to say oh these are

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,059
like actually things that we can do

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,829
better and SQL these things you can do

00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,660
better in Python and it improves the

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,339
kind of classes we can even give to

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,350
improve our own analytical community so

00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,660
we're improving the analytical

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,009
community's ability to analyze data but

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,689
basically saying here are things they

00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,860
can do better or sometimes we find oh

00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:15,689
these people are doing things in a

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,069
really best practice way let's find a

00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,809
way to broadcast this and make it more

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:19,919
brest practice and that's a really a

00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,540
very exciting thing that actually I

00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,629
think we're doing which actually

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,339
improves the entire animal community

00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:28,049
yeah and then I go going on to the last

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,350
step here I think really the key thing

00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:31,230
here

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,460
is that it used to be that a lot of

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,610
organizations I've worked for in the

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,110
past have you know analytics was not

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,220
something that was highly available that

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,020
was out there all the time like you

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,370
basically had money through Friday at

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,080
the 5:00 it was available and then it

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,370
would things we'd go down and you know

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,530
hopefully we'd be able to use stuff over

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,880
the weekend if you lost something then

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,470
it would be gone forever and you'd be

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,690
out of luck and we really didn't keep

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,430
that type of information but the reality

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,830
is in today is well particularly because

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,060
of the second the second point that we

00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,710
pointed at saying that we pointed out

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,600
there then it's really important to

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,160
ensure that you know you have an

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,870
analytics infrastructure that's highly

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,610
available that you can always use and

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,800
then people can work when they want to

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,150
when they need to and you never know

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,460
when you're gonna have a question come

00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,170
in from a regulator or something like

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,010
that that you need to answer quickly or

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,180
something that happens in the

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,250
marketplace that you need to address

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,160
quickly as well it's also important to

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,810
sure you have no data loss you know the

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,460
the worst thing that can happen to you

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,000
is you did all these in a design a lot

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,590
of work

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,850
you really didn't document what's going

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,830
on and then you have no way to actually

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,570
reproduce that later on so it's really

00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,430
important you have in a way to back

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,540
those things up on a regular basis and

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,800
ensure that you're not going to lose

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,050
anything that's been any other work

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,760
that's been done and finally policy and

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,870
market shifts I mentioned continuous

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,880
integration and continuous delivery

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,320
earlier and this kind of goes back to

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,780
that same concept that you're making

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,130
changes every time as the Jupiter

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,990
community is making changes over time

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,940
you should be able to very quickly bring

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,470
those changes in-house and put those

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,240
changes into practice as quickly as

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,980
possible so that you could sure you can

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,660
keep up with these type of things or if

00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,340
you add things and then you do changes

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,490
yourself you should be able to do the

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,200
same type of thing so I mean kind of a

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,310
theme that we've been kind of talking so

00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,260
kind of theme they've been talking back

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,690
up through this whole thing is this

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,760
envelope between agility and governance

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,350
and this chart week it was kind of

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,670
inspired by something I found and you

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,320
know in a really good Harvard Business

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,280
Review article but the way to read it is

00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,140
the x-axis is agility so if you're - if

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,190
you're near to zero you're less agile it

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,670
takes you a lot longer to make any

00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,250
change

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,050
further out you're more agile the y-axis

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,130
is governance if you're at the bottom

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,600
you're less governed if you're at the

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,280
top you're more governed the way to

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,650
think about this is roughly you know a

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,260
retail company is more likely on the

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,090
bottom bottom part of the axis they can

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,590
be far more agile they don't be nearly

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,580
so governed up work at retail companies

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,080
before and

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,580
in some cases they almost have very many

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,110
CIO groups because they don't have

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,150
saying the same kind of regulations our

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,500
marketing data as maybe a bank does a

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,990
health care company would be actually

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,880
way more would we'll sacrifice a lot of

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,590
agility to ensure governance just

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,000
because they have so many critical

00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,100
requirements around HIPPA and everything

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,210
else banks are in a weird space where we

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,070
actually have to be very much in the

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,510
middle our competitive environment tends

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,060
to be a little bit more aggressive than

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,250
then health care companies we don't have

00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,630
we're not geographically bound so we're

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,090
always competing with everybody and

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,090
they're and the pace is incredibly quick

00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,070
that being said it's everyone's money so

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:20,100
there are regulations we have to comply

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,780
to and not sound like a broken record

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,120
but not only just because we want to

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,710
satisfy the government but satisfying

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,140
the regulations is a critical part of

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,120
our brand and how we actually generate

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,500
trust in our customers well we're able

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,120
what we're finding is there are many

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,100
many things that we've done we've found

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,630
with building these tools where we can

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,930
actually push this envelope and I'll

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,300
give you one very small example we work

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,650
to kind of make it easy for people to

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,990
understand where all their data sources

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,840
and everything else within directly

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:52,170
within Jupiter lab what this lets people

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,670
do is on the one hand it makes its

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,750
improves agility because now people

00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,400
don't have to go to different places to

00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,930
look at their data sources it also

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,570
improves governance because the way we

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,630
built it was in compliance with our data

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,430
risk team and so whenever people make

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,410
any of their data management moves

00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,420
they're doing it in a way that forces

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,190
them to be compliant and so they're more

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,930
compliant but they're also also more

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,060
agile and tools can help push this

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,110
envelope further yeah and I want to I

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,520
want to go back to something I said

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,550
earlier just to kind of re emphasize

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,020
again is this is something that I very

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,080
much encourage you to really think about

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,600
because the the fact is is that the

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,430
reason people groan when we talk about

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,870
metadata or data governance or things

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,090
like that is because it is challenging

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,470
but if you can make it easy okay have

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,840
you can make it easy for them to do it

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,090
then it embedded in the tools that you

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,370
have then people will follow those rules

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,840
because it's very easy for them to

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,850
actually do the things that you're

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,290
asking them to do and so I think it's

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,820
critically important anytime you brain

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,770
things like data governance in the plane

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,690
or organization or you're thinking about

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,910
these type of things it's absolutely

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,440
critical for you to make sure it's

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,510
easy as possible it just doesn't feel

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,100
like a policy that was pushed down from

00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,660
on high but it's something that's

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,860
actually easy for them to do and comply

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,180
with it and then it benefits them as

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,280
well and if you can put it in those

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,410
terms then people will follow suit very

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,220
quickly it's not all easy to do but I

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,750
would say when you're trying to do a

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,700
product strategy to figure out how to

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,980
deliver things to your to your end

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,380
customers exactly this David said like

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,880
really push yourself to try to see don't

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,170
think of it as an either/or don't think

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,340
of it as will either have to help them

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,510
be regulated or health help them be

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,550
agile and I have to have a fight between

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,530
the two try to push yourself to see how

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,120
there's a win-win how there's a actually

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,790
by doing this we can make them more

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,470
agile and way more governed and the way

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,230
now you can offer products as a service

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,970
it's far easier to manage this it's

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,200
easier than it's not easy to do it it is

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,300
not easy you have to have a lot of

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,740
conversations and we and you have to

00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,540
have multiple customers we have our

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,490
analysts on one side we have our data

00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,440
risk team as an entirely another

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,300
customer they're dealing with but if you

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,560
work with them together you I think you

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,500
will find there are many opportunities

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,990
to do this better to get to this even

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,700
better not just give a trade off you can

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,730
push the envelope and we think that's

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:01,130
possible for everybody all right so

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,930
let's uh let's take a look at what we

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,100
kind of think of as an analytical cycle

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,840
and you know this may vary between

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,190
different organizations and the one way

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,110
that you might approach things but

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,940
really we see that there's six steps the

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,620
first step is ID eight and of course

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,850
this is where you really figure out what

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,830
the problem is you're trying to solve

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,990
what things you might go do to actually

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,580
solve those problems and so on the

00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,260
second is explored and this is where you

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,330
go out you figure out what data is out

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,190
there what's available for me to use to

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,510
actually go and solve this problem who

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,850
do I need to go talk to you what kind of

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,560
research do I need to do and the analyze

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,690
phase then you actually of course take

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,310
that information and you know if you're

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,260
a data scientist you may actually work

00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,580
on not just uncovering insights but

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,110
actually go when building the model that

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,970
you're going to use in the future and if

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,680
you're just a if you're in the analytic

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,450
space as a business analyst or a data

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,400
analyst then you might use this time

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,080
simply to uncover insights maybe using

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,880
something excel historically or

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,640
something like that as well

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,350
synthesize is where you actually take

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,940
that information those results and

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,320
combine and consolidate all those

00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,630
results together so that you can share

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,190
with others and then action may be where

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,030
you discuss this with a decision maker

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,820
and try to figure out what next step

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:08,400
you're gonna take and finally deploy is

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,560
where you take that insight and in many

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,030
circumstances actually operationalize it

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,250
and productionize it so that it can be

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,450
used in world world and sometimes this

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,770
can be the most challenging thing

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,880
because maybe there's a handoff there

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,160
and you have to throw something over the

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,960
fence from the analyst team to the IT

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,370
team or something along those lines

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,990
and so it's really important for this

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:35,370
process to kind of be cohesive together

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:37,500
so yeah yeah so I think if you kind of

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,300
look at this cycle then you know it is

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,190
just that it's a cycle so just as you

00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,930
have a you have a decision maker that

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,060
may review the results that you have and

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,530
then you may iterate with them before

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,840
you even get to the deployment phase and

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,220
once you get there that's why I said

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,570
it's really important for you to have

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,550
continuous integration and kenia's

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,290
deployment and play so that you can be

00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,360
really Adam about how you actually

00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,890
address feedback that comes up and it's

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,460
sure that you get it actually inserted

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,530
into the process going forward no I'm

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,720
going to deep detail like give them a

00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,280
concrete example like we have what maybe

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,590
one group of people that are more on the

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,000
ideation explore phase they're more on

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,850
and maybe analyze their little bit more

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,380
on the define the intent like how do we

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,320
set our policies to give the right kind

00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,640
of terms or whatever right and then we

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,050
have different teams that are far better

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,670
at saying you know you've just find the

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,310
intent let me figure out how to deploy

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,680
it and so it's part of the system part

00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,630
of a model so on and so forth but it's

00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,730
not like these things happen one after

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,990
another or another in a sequence while

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,960
the team is working on deploying the

00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,430
next model the analyst team is already

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,470
definitely working on figuring out how

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,210
they can what the next set of market

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,340
tests are what the next set of things to

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,620
deploy or Raj can you back up just a

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,360
couple of guys really so you know kind

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,800
of is almost talking with this then

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,390
really these are their regulatory

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,860
impacts at different steps in this

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,090
process so the first thing is you know

00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,920
in the explore phase data sharing is

00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,390
often limited is really difficult even

00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,220
understand what data is available in the

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,650
first place you go on to the next one

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,880
then you'll see that you know how did

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,960
you get that answer that's kind of the

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,790
thing that we were talking about a

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,620
little bit earlier this is the next one

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,490
and this one will talk like the one

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,490
thing we're finding here that's

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,740
interesting right in the old world you

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,510
want to look at how a decision was made

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,620
two years back you may have a PowerPoint

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,330
and then you don't really know

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,340
the analysis of this PowerPoint was

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,630
maybe you'll have an Excel table maybe

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,830
you'll have a pivot table and you don't

00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,920
know how the person came into that pivot

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:28,110
table the way we're doing it now it and

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,580
we'll talk about a second it's it's a

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,320
lot easier to actually say oh this was

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,300
the analysis we have it we have an

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,650
actual document that's been written and

00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,960
now we can rerun the analysis with

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,340
modern data just and we know exactly how

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,410
someone got the answer and they can

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,140
build off this answer for the next for

00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,850
their next set of analysis right and

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,350
then finally is just agility as

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,880
regulations on market changes and this

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,650
test goes back to the question we just

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,870
had about feedback mechanisms and things

00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:55,800
like that and and being able to move

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,630
quickly so you know really Jupiter can

00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,090
be at the center of this of all this you

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,470
think of this entire cycle it's possible

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,179
to kind of encapsulate everything that

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,530
goes on here within your Jupiter

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,570
environment and then maybe with some

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,850
additional tolling like things like NB

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,580
dime for example that lets you take your

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,950
jupiter notebooks and then merge them in

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,700
with changes that you see on github

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,590
where you might use something like

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,820
jenkins or Travis CI for the actual

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,570
continuous integration and delivery

00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,980
pipeline as well so here's an example of

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,309
knowledge repo and this is something

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,570
that Airbnb built and this kind of

00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:30,179
addresses a couple of different things

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,160
you see I did an explorer synthesize an

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,020
action are all highlighted and the ID a

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,059
tennis or PHA is where knowledge repo

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,400
allows you to do is take notebooks that

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,350
that others have produced and put it

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,670
into one central repository for people

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,860
to share and I'm not talking about

00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,510
storing it like in a github sense and a

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,100
central repository I'm talking about

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,200
storing it in a place where somebody can

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,179
go and view what's been done by others

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,190
whether they have access to Jupiter or

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,630
not and this could be decision makers or

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,660
folks that don't use Jupiter on a

00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,370
regular basis just to see what was done

00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,290
and then from an explorer standpoint

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,120
this also allows you to see what others

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,070
have done in the past so that you can

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,809
incorporate those type of analysis in

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,530
what you're doing going forth and you

00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:09,300
know this could be a real challenge

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,160
particularly as your organization is

00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,320
larger to even know what was done before

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,750
you could have one group over here that

00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,640
did work on something and then you find

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,990
out later after the fact that actually

00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,550
they had already figured all that stuff

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,800
out and you wasted all this work during

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,750
the process so if you go look at the

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,000
action the synthesize an action phase

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,920
then you kind of have a different

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,150
scenario there and this is where you

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,860
know if you're trying to share out

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,720
results this is a way that you can share

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,550
results with others they can comment

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,050
back and you can collaborate together on

00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,940
things and that way you can go through

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,320
this process of iteration in your

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,420
analysis that you know most of us

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,850
typically do we're in an analytic

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,929
exercise and to be fair we're working

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,090
progress in this particular thing but

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:49,679
again here we need to figure out a way

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,840
to make this possible but in a regulated

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,910
way some people don't need access to all

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,290
these different data sets and we're

00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,790
working through with again with our

00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,940
governance team on how to make this

00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,350
possible but again it makes the analysis

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,760
analyst job much easier because they can

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,070
say oh all these analysis have already

00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,330
been done but we're still protecting

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,040
ourselves and we're protecting our

00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,320
customers by making sure that only the

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,679
right people can see the right data sets

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,679
and output

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,480
all right so another piece of this is

00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,800
this Florin analyze phase and I already

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,080
talked about metadata a little bit

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,790
earlier but this screenshot is actually

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,400
from tableau and if you're familiar with

00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,900
tableau then there's an there's a

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,310
feature in tableau where you can hover

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,470
over a field that you're going to be

00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,450
using a tableau and it basically shows

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,890
that metadata under the field the

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,179
problem is of course a tableau you have

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,550
to actually enter that information and

00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,980
the tableau but we're going to be

00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,450
interesting if in jupiter you could

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,550
actually see this so you're going to go

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,020
back to the idea of some type of data

00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,310
source browser where you can see what

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,140
data is out there what columns are out

00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,340
there you can actually hover over this

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,110
information and see the metadata

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,790
underneath and that way you don't have

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,679
the context switch between what you have

00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,510
in front of you and something that's

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,160
online that tells you the data

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,750
dictionary that has only information and

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,340
then or your company is mad at data

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,500
catalog or something along those lines

00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,000
and the less said you have the context

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,650
switch the more you can be productive

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,110
and you can find the things that you

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,540
need more easily a second thing is PO

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,100
completion and contextual data so you

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,200
know when you think about you know

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,820
modern IDs that are out there and duper

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,400
does have facilities for code completion

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,560
involved then why not have your code

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,200
completion integrated with your metadata

00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,240
data catalog so that as you're typing a

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,380
field that can actually pop up and tell

00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,570
you what's actually there

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,760
and on top of it you know going back to

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,560
what rod was talking about earlier with

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,510
actually logging what your users are

00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,490
doing on a regular basis why not have

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,440
contextual data there too so in other

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,780
words you have a group that's using this

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,070
data on a regular basis prioritize it

00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,210
tell them this is the most important

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,860
thing this is the thing that most people

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,150
are using and things like that to help

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,580
them get to what they need a little bit

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,870
more quickly and then finally you know

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,670
you think about like the database

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,190
schemas itself so if you've got an

00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,020
already VMs underneath and you're trying

00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,340
to work with that maybe you can just put

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,690
your database schema in there to give

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,940
people an understanding of how

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,090
everything kind of connects together one

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,710
thing I'd say here is like Netflix has a

00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,660
huge presence here the reason FX is very

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,370
successful is because they are very good

00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,600
at analyzing their own and like how

00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,990
people are using their product right

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,310
very similarly we can actually like when

00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,360
you start doing things like this

00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,250
you have a tremendous model information

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,500
how your customers are using data we're

00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,300
actually like a burnin are there other

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,650
hat we're actually also looking at this

00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,840
this kind of information how people are

00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,280
using through our notebook how people

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,170
are using the all our different data

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,360
sources to help us work out how to

00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,130
constantly evolve and improve our own

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,420
data sources themselves therefore

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:41,400
improving the entire customer ecosystem

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,600
and this last one I'll this cuts were

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,880
really quick because I want to make sure

00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,260
we get to questions as well you know I

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,020
talked a little bit earlier about having

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,900
it continuous integration and delivery

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,700
pipeline and mention MB dime earlier I

00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,970
think one really good example of this is

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,610
that from a regulatory standpoint using

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,050
NB dime but then what you do is before

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,250
you commit to github and given your

00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,660
notebook out there that you actually

00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,400
remove all the data from the notebook as

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,510
well you know if you do that and you

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,740
make sure that the data is not out there

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,510
you kind of address your data sharing

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,310
concerns and needs as well but then

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,720
other folks to still use those notebooks

00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,250
for the purpose that they need to be

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,120
using them for and rerun the things in a

00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,970
producible analysis here you'll see

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,890
airflow and then if you hit the next one

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,540
Spotify is Luigi you know these are

00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,120
really good ways for you to actually

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,440
take take notebooks and then be able to

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,440
actually run those notebooks in such a

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,519
way that you can

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,620
connect things together in a data

00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,710
process and in these tools you can also

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,210
build in things like you know regulatory

00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,460
checks and making sure the folks to do

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,620
things certain ways like use a batch ID

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,820
versus user personal IDs so if they're

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,080
not there then the rest of their team

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,490
can do the work that they need to do as

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,490
well and so that's something the hall

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,110
second Center basically I mean it lets

00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:55,809
just schedule notebooks but in a highly

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:57,429
regulated way so tools are great but

00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,289
they're only as good as your data

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:01,269
governance policies if you don't have

00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:02,200
really good data governance in place and

00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:04,809
a lot of the things we talked about

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,879
today you can't actually do the second

00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:08,409
thing is to really ensure you embed this

00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:10,570
in your culture now going back to the

00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:13,149
idea make it something that's easy for

00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,860
everybody and your organization to do

00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:16,629
and then they'll end up doing because

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,500
it's just easy to do it and it benefits

00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:19,179
them as well

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,980
and one thing I'll say here is so here

00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,909
I'll plug a bit that I've been like I

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,320
said I've been a couple one a year

00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,429
Dave's been here long longer I've been

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,039
in pro incredibly responding with

00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:28,120
Capital One that our culture does make

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,070
this embedding in our culture a little

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,210
bit easier but when I'm find we're

00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,559
finding something really amazing and I

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,850
think I think it's somewhat unique

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,799
Capital One may not actually be unique

00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,419
Capital One as we've gotten these tools

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:39,399
out we're actually finding little micro

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:41,379
teams up like organically forming

00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,490
they're helping each other work out how

00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,139
do this analysis they're helping them

00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,759
work out how to use these tools it's

00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:47,470
actually becoming a big part of what

00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,659
they do now part of this is we go

00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,830
through a reasonably frequent like every

00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,149
couple of weeks I'm kind of training

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,039
some kind of session some kind of

00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:55,809
someone come up and give a demo as to

00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,509
what you did a best-case scenario that

00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,549
kind of thing but it you're finding

00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:02,320
these small groups connect like

00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:03,610
organically form and actually use these

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,450
tools more and more which is an

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,720
incredibly exciting thing about

00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:09,759
embedding a native culture okay and then

00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,590
workarounds are a red flag if you start

00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,000
seeing those type of things like you put

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,230
a process in place and people start

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,179
working around what you put in place

00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,740
then you need to really take a step back

00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:19,659
and say what are we doing wrong in our

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,830
process so that we can do it differently

00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:22,389
to ensure that everybody's following the

00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,700
rules but doing in the easiest way

00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:25,899
possible

00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,090
this particular one's my favorite take a

00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,590
customer centric approach like the way

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,320
we did this was we started pretty much

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,549
and we said let's just have a big

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,840
announcement like talked to all the

00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,399
people who actually will use this

00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,990
we're various kinds of analysis we're

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,639
trying to do to scientists let's

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,710
understand with a use case list and how

00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:42,820
they're using these products that way it

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,649
makes our team

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,659
more focus as to what to provide and

00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:48,610
then when we provided where we don't

00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:50,049
just like go off in a corner and go cave

00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,049
and go build something and come out

00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:55,029
within six months we actively used a lot

00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:57,639
like we asked for help from some of the

00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:59,289
analyst leaders and said go find one

00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,600
minute go find two or three people and

00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:02,980
to help us actually make sure that we're

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,779
building the right thing we rotate those

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,460
people get your customers deeply

00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:08,679
involved in your process make it such

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,750
that it's not a us versus you or you

00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:11,590
versus them kind of thing make them part

00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,059
of the process and make them

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,750
collaborators in building the tools that

00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:18,490
you want to build and then the last

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,110
thing is nothing is new everybody's done

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,940
something something like this before so

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,549
it's amazing you know I used Emmy dime

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,929
as an example before I mean we felt like

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:27,429
we needed to build something like that

00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,720
and we went out there and guess what

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,090
there was something already out there so

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,590
don't as an organization it's just not

00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,330
necessary to go and we give them at the

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,740
wheel all the time sometimes it may feel

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,779
like the cool thing to do as an engineer

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,580
an engineer and I'm an engineer myself

00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:41,799
so you know I like doing the cool thing

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,090
but at the same time you can add so much

00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,620
more value if you can give things out

00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,759
there quickly and then focus on the

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,649
things where there really is a

00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,500
significant gap and there's really you

00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:52,299
need to your organizational all right

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,350
thank you do we have time for questions

00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:59,710
five minutes all right great thank you

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:02,350
great great discussion you made a big

00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:06,220
point of talking about deeply involving

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:09,700
the extended team and fostering

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:13,260
collaboration how far does that go with

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:16,179
Jupiter and are there other tools or

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,540
platforms you use to extend the

00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:21,159
collaboration to developers that are

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:25,419
operationalizing models to IT to the

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,859
governor's team to the business I went

00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:30,129
on package a question in two things one

00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,569
is you first asked how much how deeply

00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:33,250
do you involve your customers and stuff

00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,629
I'll say that there's like involve them

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,099
as much as much time as they can give

00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:38,349
you right make them part of the process

00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:40,359
and that's for any for everything that

00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:41,200
we're trying to secondary question the

00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,720
list of things that were actually doing

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,470
for everything we build we involve our

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,550
customers very deeply and so we and we

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,470
try to make sure that everything we're

00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,569
building definitely has it has to have

00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,250
at least a customer set of customers

00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:55,899
that have said yes this is valuable

00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,290
through some kind of POC some kind of

00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:58,660
you

00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,160
in a paper demo we like it's very

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,170
critical to us that we always do this

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:08,410
before we build any code gets committed

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:11,650
to get something technologically

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:14,610
unifying is is Jupiter extend to these

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,050
other constituents in the total workflow

00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,910
yes I think if not are there other

00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,410
things that you also use so I think

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:24,040
there is a couple of things I mean we

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,450
heavily hues github issues to track what

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,030
our custom what feedback our customers

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,440
have and slack in terms of Jupiter

00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,870
itself and what we do around Jupiter

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,060
what we find is that it's not just good

00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,980
for a business analyst or data scientist

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,320
but even folks like the engineers and

00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,850
things like that can use it as well and

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,500
so we find a lot of people kind of test

00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,390
things out and use Jupiter as a testing

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,520
around to figure out how to do things

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,930
and oftentimes will actually have people

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,430
come back to us and have like a pull

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,410
request back to us and say hey you know

00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,480
can you add this thing in I love to see

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,070
this library in and stuff as well and so

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,810
we have a very open ecosystem from that

00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,640
sort of turned that standpoint we do

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,190
have other tools as well unfortunately I

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,690
can't talk about specifics on those but

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,040
we have other tools that are part of

00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:13,270
that ecosystem that kind of connect

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:15,640
everything together as well so thanks

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,770
this is very very very good presentation

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,870
and you saw me nodding pretty much at

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,930
every bullet because that paper we have

00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,460
the same kind of problems and challenges

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:27,460
my question was on the metadata and

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,170
reuse how much of that has been built

00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:36,670
out and how much of it do you use

00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:38,440
Jupiter for so I don't know a fair

00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,990
amount of the data gathering has been

00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,000
built out the Jupiter part of it is

00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,820
right now and like I would say alpha not

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,850
yet in the beta yeah and I would just

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:51,250
add to that as an organization then the

00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:53,020
important step that we've taken is

00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,330
ensure that there is a central metadata

00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,760
catalog and so I think that's absolutely

00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,470
a first step to get things done and then

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,300
from there then you can leverage that in

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:03,310
all these other tools like Jupiter so

00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,840
the the browser that Raj mentioned

00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,720
earlier we would not be able to build

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,740
that unless we had something like like

00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:15,940
the metadata catalog in place we have

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:18,160
time for one more quick question hi um I

00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,619
was wondering if you could reiterate the

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,470
use of the da G the directed acyclic

00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:27,609
graph produced by airflow in your data

00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:29,890
management process let me think about

00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:33,430
how I can best talk about that

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:35,050
so yes we are very regulated and that

00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,450
includes talking about some of these

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,930
things as well so so I think we in the

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:43,660
case of in the case of airflow then the

00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:46,869
value in that is that there's a quite a

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,960
bit of flexibility in airflow if we were

00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:52,570
to use airflow for you to be able to use

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,700
things for individual users as well as

00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,580
provide a provide capabilities for

00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,349
production processes as well and airflow

00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,500
has capabilities to really cover both

00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:04,869
needs so for example from Jupiter you

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,020
may you may integrate Jupiter with

00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:10,240
airflow and then the and then execute

00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:13,060
schedule notebooks on airflow as a

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,260
result I say it's always valuable as

00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,550
well to ensure that there's an

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,619
understanding of what's happening on

00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,740
other covers so it's good to also bubble

00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:24,460
up what that dag or directed acyclic

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:27,339
laugh looks like in the actual uhm IDE

00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,990
or tool that your users are actually

00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:30,880
using so they can understand what's

00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,970
actually happening behind the scenes and

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,130
it just as a regulator a regulated

00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:39,609
company internally transparency is very

00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,410
very important not just to folks with

00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,940
the folks that directly use the tool

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:47,470
with the folks that do not indirectly

00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,790
use the tool as well that answer let's

00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:53,710
thank our speakers one more time

00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,710
