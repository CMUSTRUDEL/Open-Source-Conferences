already welcome to the roundtable for

00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,519
business summit and I want to thank all

00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,419
of the speakers here participating on

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:18,130
this in order David Sheff from Capital

00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:21,640
One and Dan benka from Amazon AWS stage

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:26,500
maker and Michelle effort from Netflix

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:29,650
and pivot should he write from Oracle

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,430
slash did a science comm Dave Stewart

00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:36,400
from DoD and Michael Lee from the data

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,370
incubator wonderful so what we wanted to

00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,650
do is particularly a panel of people in

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,540
different areas of enterprise involved

00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:47,200
very much with Jupiter particularly a

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,760
tributary infrastructure at scale and we

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,100
wanted to discuss some of the issues

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,690
have been coming up about enterprise

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,890
where we've seen in terms of compliance

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:59,320
privacy ethics but also other issues

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,970
that have come up during the the topic

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,370
of the course here and we have a few

00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,260
questions made I'm happy to field

00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,689
questions from the audience also but I'd

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,070
like to moderate those I since we have

00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,689
folks from different companies here I

00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,909
really didn't want to have this be

00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,320
pointed at any particular company or any

00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,909
particular individual we want to talk

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,539
about what are issues that are common

00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:21,460
across enterprise all right does anybody

00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,340
have a burning issue you want to want me

00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,539
to throw out a question or shall I

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,890
actually what would be good first though

00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:28,780
is how about if we just go down the line

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,409
and everybody just gives like a one line

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:45,369
or a brief intro of who you are and what

00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:46,990
your interests are thank you

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,939
and in that kind of training process

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,859
both for the fellowship that we run with

00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,289
for PhDs

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:56,350
exiting academia entering industry and

00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:59,859
for the corporate training that we do we

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,619
rely heavily on Jupiter we were you know

00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:04,899
an early adopter back in 2014 when they

00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:07,119
were still called ipython notebooks and

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,900
now we're trying to push the envelope

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,440
with running kind of large MOOCs for the

00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,170
developing world and doing that all on

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,610
Jupiter hub

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,470
I'm Dave Stewart so I work for the

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,570
apartment defense and and inside the US

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,400
intelligence community and I've led an

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,370
effort for the last three years to get

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,590
Jupiter used by Enterprise analysts

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,880
within the IC to really empower them to

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,930
apply code to their tradecraft making

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,420
that tree craft more efficient more

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,980
repeatable and more shareable as a lot

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,440
of the challenges I mean the scale of

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,450
our organization a lot of collaboration

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,400
challenges as well as some of the

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,650
sensitivity of our data and the

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,020
challenges and how do we collaborate you

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,610
know with different levels of roles and

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,620
accesses and given the classified nature

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,670
of a lot of our work so happen to me I'm

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,820
looking forward all the questions but

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,940
we'll get into that more later hi guys

00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,950
Pramod I used to look for a start-up

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:05,020
data science comm I say used to because

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,880
we simply got acquired by Oracle and so

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,940
myself I work on different aspects of

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,070
machine learning I use or we've been

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,410
using Jupiter a lot and off that I've

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,360
been exploring better ways of model

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,790
explanation evaluation that kind of

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,410
stuff so happy to fill you any questions

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,650
if you guys have anything specific to

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:27,760
machine learning evaluation or Jupiter

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:30,070
environment in general hi guys my name

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,410
is Michelle I lead the big data tools

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,290
team at Netflix which is a team of

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,760
software engineers focused on usability

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,989
improvements and innovation for the

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,390
Netflix data platform

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:45,130
I guess I'm Dan Banga I work for AWS and

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,110
that focus on machine learning platforms

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,269
at a Tobias essentially what that means

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,700
is that I work with our customers to

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,970
understand what are their needs as far

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,580
as platforms are concerned and what my

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,519
engineering team and my team does is to

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,860
accelerate the process of essentially

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,959
building on top of the SS technologies

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,080
so what that means is that we provide

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,000
Jupiter as a platform and we provide

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,860
model training and model hosting as

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,780
platforms as well I saw algorithms as a

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:19,359
platform hi my name is David Sheff and I

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,850
lead the financial services data product

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,120
engineering team in our financial

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,760
services division at Capital One and

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,130
primarily we focus on creating platforms

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,290
for

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,240
analysts and data scientists to be able

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,640
to consume our data and user data and

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,920
the most effective way possible and that

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,290
includes both things like Jupiter and

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,990
other notebook products as well as

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,670
things like reporting based platforms

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,600
for users to be able to do reporting as

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:49,520
well already I'm gonna start off with

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,330
one of the questions we had circulated

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,910
earlier with and also going along with

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,040
the title of the roundtable with GDP our

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,230
recently coming into effect and with

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,620
similar kinds of legislation now in

00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,080
California CA privacy probably somewhat

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,580
of a trend picking up in the u.s. are

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,310
are you seeing examples or can you point

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,740
to examples of data being more

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,630
intentional in the enterprise as far as

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,990
data collection or is it more a matter

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,900
of drawing back from collecting data

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,700
that it's unnecessary is there is there

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,350
any kind of a distinction there is it

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,720
reactive or is it proactive I guess

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,990
that's probably the question and you

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,780
take or something so I I think it's

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,120
important and for any enterprise to

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,350
really take a look at their data sharing

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,740
policies in the way that they govern

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,240
their data and really to think about how

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,400
you can manage things front in an

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,950
unassailable way and what I mean by

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,940
unassailable is you know there's things

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,320
that are going to come down the pipeline

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,520
and there's things that you can see in

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,380
the marketplace that are happening for

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,450
example just with what happened recently

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,230
with Facebook and the California law

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:59,120
that that Paco mentioned and the reality

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,800
is is that we have to prepare and be and

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,760
be open to the idea that these type of

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,710
changes are going to come down the

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,240
pipeline so the best thing that really

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,700
do is just to make sure that as an

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,140
organization you really focus on having

00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,240
these practices in place so from the

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,860
get-go and that way as these kind of

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,510
policies come down come down and

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,550
actually get implemented then you're in

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,830
a position where you can you can very

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,520
easily transition in numbers or whatever

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,070
those changes might be you know what I

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,590
mean after that is policy really brings

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,770
in the requirement or the need to start

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,770
digging deeper into you know where's the

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,169
data who owns to data and then who has

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,419
access to the data right so data

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,669
cataloging becomes more and more

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,849
critical within the enterprise and a

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:43,770
tooling around data

00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,839
cataloguing also becomes more and more

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,300
critical and so that's that's another

00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,999
aspect of of looking at that right where

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,770
I think for machine learning to be

00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:55,199
successful there's this whole concept of

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,360
having to share data which is very

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,069
important but at the same time you want

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,439
to be able to share the data with the

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,990
principal's within the company that can

00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,459
have access to that data so I don't see

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,399
a pull back from an enterprise

00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,619
standpoint I see more control as to who

00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,270
has access to the data and then using

00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:19,529
the tools who to make sure you ensure

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:21,389
that yeah absolutely so Jupiter is used

00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,189
to essentially accessed empathizer

00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,499
access to those data sets for example

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:30,269
that could be on a cloud storage and

00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:32,939
then use the data you know the policies

00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:35,339
on the data set itself in order to limit

00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,479
access to to that data yes or no so what

00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,819
that means is that you could have a

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,919
Jupiter template that says well the data

00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,719
is in this location and then you would

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,519
use it but it would fail for you for

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:46,349
example if you don't have the specific

00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:51,809
explicit access to that piece of data

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:53,939
set I can't speak to the privacy aspect

00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:55,199
specifically but what it can't tell you

00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,259
is that we take privacy very seriously

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,209
and we've taken a systemic approach

00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:02,249
because we know that this is an area

00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:04,139
that's constantly evolving and we know

00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:06,389
we're going to see more changes here so

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,430
we we've developed what we call a paved

00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,399
path so that anybody who's on the system

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,209
using the set of tools that we provide

00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,249
we're going to take care of those

00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:16,469
privacy changes whenever possible for

00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:19,229
them and we have a multi-pronged

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:21,360
approach to detecting any sort of like

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:22,740
private data that gets into the system

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,499
and apparently and gets automatically

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:32,009
removed so my perspective on privacy in

00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:33,990
gdpr so far has been that in space when

00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:37,680
we have to build models is I feel that

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,209
it's both reactive and proactive from

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,490
the very beginning of data collection

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:45,000
the sources are so heterogeneous these

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,889
days now and there could be so many bias

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,990
that could be introduced even as we are

00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:50,819
collecting the data so that that point

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,970
itself it becomes very important that we

00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:55,230
have we involve the stakeholders very

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,970
early on even as

00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,800
collecting the data so that we could

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,230
make corrections as we needed now the

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,210
the reactive part is when you're

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,860
building these modules again at that

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,860
point in time what features are actually

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,330
considered what are not considered why

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,660
we are considering it these questions

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,190
becomes very important and and having an

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,730
environment which is very interactive

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,440
like Jupiter helps in one this

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,880
collaboration which could be with very

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,110
heterogeneous you know people coming

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,580
from different environment different

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,700
backgrounds some could be ingenious

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,430
linguistic psychologists business folks

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,450
and having like a common platform so

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,220
that we could all speak the same

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,620
language becomes very important in

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:39,300
solving such data governance and policy

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,470
issues so I'll just add like from our

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,820
perspective right we're coming in from

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,900
the different side of it we're being in

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,540
government you know Julie kind of

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,190
mentioned in her talk like you're only

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,690
authorized to do what your governing

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,970
authorities in law and kind of policy

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,180
gives you for your data so we already

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,230
you know everything we do needs to be

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,450
kind of drawn back to those authorities

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,980
and then you know that law of that

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,300
policy and so the interesting thing is I

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,970
think from you know private companies

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,260
but from the private sector is this

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,940
potentially brings a more in line with

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,900
how government has already had to access

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,540
state and some of the challenges that we

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,590
already have because we've always had

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:29,280
you know regulations given our

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:32,910
authorities so yeah just to add to that

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,930
I mean so we so I'll tell you a story

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,730
and just give you a bit of background

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,070
love the story so we run this

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,220
application process for this free

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,710
fellowship we give to PhDs and so we get

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,210
thousands of applicants and sometimes

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,560
those applicants come from Europe so

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,020
this time around we had an applicant

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,700
came through they didn't make it it's a

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,110
pretty competitive process but they

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,550
didn't make it and then afterwards they

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,660
wrote hey I'd I like to I'm invoking my

00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,210
right to be forgotten and I'd like to

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,500
have my records lead from the database

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,280
and so that then sort of brings up a

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,160
whole bunch of issues right like one

00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,760
well there's okay you have their record

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,680
but you

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,320
in the way you know you layout your

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,120
database or your system there's a record

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,589
and then there's a joining records so

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,329
you don't just lead you know one thought

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,529
one record there's multiple records you

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:21,060
have to kind of go chasing those down

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,980
but if you think about that some more

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,209
then there's all the log files what

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,699
happens if you logged oh user you know

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:31,769
XYZ with this email address log logged

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:33,540
in at this time that becomes a thing but

00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:35,250
that's in a log file that was probably

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,079
written in a rewrite only architecture

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,790
or let's say write favorable

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,260
architecture and that's read

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,750
architecture so like removing a line

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,160
from that is sort of not easy right so

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,019
there's all sorts of things that you

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,880
kind of have to think about and I think

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:51,779
it's starting to change you know that's

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,630
a very small easy to understand example

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,800
in a small company right but if you

00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,010
think about now blowing that up to a

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,579
large enterprise where you're operating

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,690
in Europe and America and Asia and they

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,310
all have different rules about how you

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,260
do this how does that affect the way you

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,490
architect your data and you how does

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,500
that affect the way you do logging or

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:47,279
any of these issues it only makes it

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:48,839
more complex so I'm an economist ooh I'm

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,250
gonna say two different things and

00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:56,130
neither of them are gonna be right right

00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:59,430
so bear with me so on the one on the one

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,079
hand as Truman said you know I think

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,089
it's a very good thing that people are

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,110
paying attention to privacy and I think

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:10,350
it's it's an important conversation one

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,779
has to have and I'm glad that the

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,190
Europeans have initiated that much more

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,230
than has happened in the United States

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:21,089
having said that I think the focus is

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,200
completely wrong and I think what it is

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:24,300
impossible so

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,340
my colleague and co-author Helena Simone

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,930
we did this book on big data privacy in

00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,860
the public good

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:34,950
you know the twin pillars upon which the

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,190
this whole privacy conversation is

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,800
addressed as informed consent and

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,660
anonymization and neither of those are

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,440
possible it's gone

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,620
you can't anonymize data you could

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,230
de-identified but you can't anonymize an

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:56,270
informed consent is a meaningless

00:13:52,230 --> 00:14:00,480
construct how many of you in the room

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:02,820
use Google Maps how many of you read the

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:08,070
thing that's allowed you to read the

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:19,680
remote one person you have a wasted life

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:21,390
sir anyone used it anyway right but even

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,890
if they you did read it there is no way

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,690
that they can tell you how it's going to

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,300
be used and there's no way they can tell

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,700
you what the impact is because they

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,980
don't know and Facebook doesn't know if

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,210
my kids put a you know a picture up on

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,470
Facebook and they're drinking and

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,880
they've approved it what about all the

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,920
other kids who are in the background

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,280
drinking beer and doing god knows what

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,260
else so I think the focus has to be not

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,840
on informed consent which makes people

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,990
feel good but it's a silly outdated

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:54,090
concept and it needs to go much too much

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:57,060
more towards ethical use you know trying

00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:00,270
to exchange trying to build informed

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,540
consent and promises unenforceable and

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,610
that and unreasonable discussions of

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,260
anonymization or that you're going to be

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:12,080
pulled out of the data set it's just not

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,080
feasible so we need to have ethical use

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,670
picking up especially on the last two

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,420
speakers thread in and I wonder what

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:31,220
your thoughts are across your domains on

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,720
the notion this notion of the right to

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,000
be forgotten there's no it's sort of

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,450
please pull the BlackBerry back out of

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,720
the smoothie right how how does that

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,190
work and how Dee because data is rarely

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,560
these days of the data you want in the

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,170
real meaning of data in industrial

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,210
pipelines is the models that ingest that

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,890
the data and created predictions and are

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,470
now implemented and instrumented and

00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:57,140
applied to new data right I have never

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,030
seen anyone describe how you pull one

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:03,260
data record out and reconstruct our

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:05,300
model pipeline - that data point and so

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:26,030
how do you get the the blackberries out

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:29,680
of your smoothies I want every fourth

00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,680
letter of this Google Doc removed

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,020
and so sorry so the question is how can

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:27,149
we make use of the data because the data

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,940
exists they're going to get used it's a

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,980
contribution to society was the earth so

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,600
I was on the National Academies panel on

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,390
teaching data science to undergraduates

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,460
and one of the things that we

00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,070
recommended was there's the equivalent

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:51,419
of the Hippocratic oath for the data

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:54,049
scientist nothing so it reduces the

00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,049
probability

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:26,340
I mean so I think I'm just gonna

00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,910
actually add to your point about sort

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:32,790
ethical use actually I was gonna agree

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:34,890
that you know if you think about one

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,210
traditionally very sensitive piece of

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,880
data that we've actually had a lot of

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,610
like regulation around its credit data

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,840
and it's not so much the regulation is

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:49,410
less so on how what kind of data like an

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,059
axion or Experian hoard but it's much

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,190
more about like what banks can use that

00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,550
data and what feels they can use on that

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,480
data

00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:05,850
I mean I'm sorry

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:12,120
this is yeah forget about it see my New

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:14,280
York accent come out now so see the

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,990
problem with those credit scoring models

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,640
is you're quite right that the

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,660
regulations say that you're not allowed

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,360
to include race right so instead of

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,100
saying instead of including race and

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,290
then saying that is a strong predictor

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,179
and then thinking about why it's a

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,429
strong predictor what they include

00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,650
instead other things that are highly

00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:38,220
correlated with race so it has exactly

00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:40,530
the same effect taking race out doesn't

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,530
solve the problem my understanding and

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,780
perhaps somebody from from the financial

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,390
side can comment on this we said we work

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,530
with a lot of companies in the financial

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,450
services and we sort of do a lot of

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,850
training with them and what they're

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,150
saying is that there's and they're

00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,360
actually saying not and but but and yes

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:04,980
and so it's yes we it's not only that we

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,510
can't have race as a factor explicitly

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,580
but it's also that we have to pass an

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,580
effects test so we have to show

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,900
we're not you know the obvious example

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,450
is zip code right because given the way

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,510
we're very we live in a sort of a highly

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,820
segregated patterns that that

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,680
effectively come can become a proxy for

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,790
race and that that is also sort of the

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,820
kind of thing that you're not allowed to

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,260
include because these what they're

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,990
saying is that the regulators are sort

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,460
of looking at well does it's the

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,340
introduction in this variable actually

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,620
kind of de-facto add race in and perhaps

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,540
you've had a different experience well

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:51,030
so that's the HMDA regulations right

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:52,710
anyway I think to that point and I can't

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,360
speak specifically to what Capital One

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,920
does on this but I will just generally

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,920
state that for a financial services

00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,360
industry then that's essentially what

00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,820
Michael described is basically the way

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,320
that things are done it's true that

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,460
there could be bad actors involved and

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,450
things like that as well so I think

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,160
Julia's point the idea of having looking

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,360
things from an ethical lens and ensuring

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,280
that there's a level playing field from

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,020
an ethical standpoint as difficult as

00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,000
that might be you want to ensure that

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,850
the organizations that are using your

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,230
data are are held to the same standard

00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,370
in terms of with a way that they're

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,280
actually using the data and that's

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,890
that's important but but typically what

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,480
financial services companies do is they

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,340
take a look at the data that's there and

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,410
from a credit reporting standpoint they

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,210
need to make sure that they're not just

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,070
using like that race variable or that

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,180
gender variable for example but they

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,250
also have to look at things that are

00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,230
highly correlated with it as well

00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,420
and most organizations have some type of

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,070
model governance organization in place

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,290
that looks at those type of things in

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,240
addition your regulators will also come

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,730
in and ask you there's questions too so

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,840
and they'll they'll also hold you

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,400
accountable to make sure that you're

00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,750
actually looking at those things so

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,030
that's not to say the things don't creep

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,100
in because I they do but at the same

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,930
time there is there are multiple eyes on

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,300
it looking at those type of things to

00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,280
try to figure out whether or not the

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,180
things are being done the right way or

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,180
not so

00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:36,520
yeah and I think that's very true but I

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,070
would take like you know the financial

00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,169
services industry as a whole typically

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,580
you're going to classify your data in

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:45,370
certain ways and have separations

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,070
between things so for example there's

00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,960
something called a FCRA which governs a

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,940
lot of what you can do with data for

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,860
certain types of activities and so you

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,529
have to actually cordon off your data in

00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,750
such a way that you ensure that things

00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,730
like if I want to share data between my

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,649
credit card division and my retail bank

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,330
division if there are different legal

00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,010
entities I cannot share that data in

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,710
certain ways unless I've got in certain

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,990
types of permission in order to do that

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,240
and at the same time if there's credit

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,059
data versus its non-public information

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,159
like our personal information I'm sorry

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,020
if it's personal information like your

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,159
your name and address and your social

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,539
security number and things like that

00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,010
those are governed separately and often

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:25,480
times you'll find that you don't have

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,029
your credit data with the personal

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,000
information so that is not directly

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:32,740
identify viable the julious point that

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,059
does not mean that you cannot go back

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,010
and connect the dots together it is

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:37,330
quite possible to do that but the goal

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,070
is just to make sure that those things

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,679
are not together so that the individual

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,720
is looking at I can't easily get to this

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,000
is personal I personally identified as

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,620
somebody over here and this is how their

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,330
credit score looks like and what their

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,010
entire profile looks like so that's at

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,169
least the goal in doing that and that's

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,549
something that from my experience in the

00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:56,529
retail industry is not present for

00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:58,659
example you know the data is much more

00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:01,390
mixed together it's difficult to extract

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:02,649
the BlackBerry from the smoothie and and

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,120
so those are not protections that are

00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,880
necessarily in other areas it kind of

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,799
depends on what industry you're in so

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,850
thank you I wanted to pick up on

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,490
something there was a comment earlier

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:14,440
about oaths and Hippocratic oath being

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,270
applied to say data science but there

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,029
are other comments throughout the day I

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,100
know that some organizations are moving

00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:23,380
toward much more self-serve analytics

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,940
and empowering the domain experts for

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,040
like citizen data science we've been

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,490
talking about but yet there's also

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,650
efforts afoot for some companies to

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,540
certify actually at the corporate level

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,040
coming down and certifying who are the

00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,350
data scientists

00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:43,270
is there a tension there well those two

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:45,580
things work together well can a company

00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,530
certify who is a data scientist or not

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,050
at the same time as making sub service

00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:59,320
analytics and citizen data science is is

00:25:50,050 --> 00:26:05,800
that practical in the enterprise so yeah

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:09,730
there's attention yeah so I you know the

00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,170
partner defense yeah you know the

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,700
intelligent community yet we have this

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,320
tension absolutely right so you know my

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,720
talk was on so doesn't data science so I

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,720
can give one perspective and the one

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,800
side of this talk right but so yeah we

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,280
had both those efforts might be of

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,610
efforts to certify data scientist it can

00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,780
mean in some cases like incentive pay so

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,980
it actually could mean something

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,260
tangible to that employee to be

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,490
certified as a data scientist and then

00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,630
we have this big effort and so it's

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,490
instead of self-serving we called DIY

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,580
analytics right so do-it-yourself

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,320
analytics and there there is a tension

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,730
right with the there's been attention is

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,620
you know for two years now in this

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,870
community internally about how to do

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,430
this and I'm one that says in data

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,350
science that I can talk about my kind of

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,600
frustrations with that tension but I

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,220
think you know sometimes these these

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,260
conversations that we've had internally

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,550
right in this thing this tension takes

00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,810
away from the larger point of you know

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,100
what it is we're here to do right we're

00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,480
not here to do data science just for the

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,910
sake of doing data science it's not ends

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,710
to itself we are here to providing value

00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,120
to the mission and so where we can

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,110
demonstrate and I think our effort has

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,760
helped demonstrate that there is

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,470
enormous value in taking people who have

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,020
domain knowledge and teach them just a

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,790
little bit of code to do you know it may

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,410
be workflow automation it may not be you

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,670
know classical data science no machine

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,490
learning or system modeling or anything

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,680
but it's providing value then that is

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,960
you know like I think should carry the

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,920
weight and then we need in and we

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,120
haven't figured it out so we haven't

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,460
tried to find out you know at what point

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,780
does a citizen data scientist turn into

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,280
a real data scientist that could qualify

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,470
for a different work or potentially

00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,400
different pay so that all needs to be

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,509
kind of addressed but yeah they can when

00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,190
we first start out with this effort we

00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:44,529
we got some pushback from the the data

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,729
science community internally and again

00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,289
from from my perspective you know one

00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:49,239
side of the debate I think it misses the

00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,589
larger point of is their value in that

00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:54,339
and I think an enormous if there's value

00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:56,709
in it and where I made my observation is

00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,820
there is as much if not more value and

00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,719
taking some of the main knowledge and

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,219
teaching them a little bit of code

00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,570
Ezra's not taking the data scientist and

00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:03,399
teaching of the domain knowledge because

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,149
they're equally complex tasks they're

00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:09,429
equally complex disciplines and in our

00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:11,169
case that the domain is so kind of

00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,459
unique that these people who have

00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:14,619
trained for years and have done all this

00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:15,849
work to be domain knowledge experts ken

00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:18,249
can you know make that move up the

00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:20,799
ladder in the other direction yeah

00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:22,629
actually I wanted to echo that so we do

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,799
a lot of these kind of certified

00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:26,440
corporate trainings if you well so we

00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:28,929
come into a large organization and lo

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,389
and behold they are used to using SAS or

00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:34,149
Oracle or some sort of more legacy tool

00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:35,979
and they the executives so does like

00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:38,499
we've seen the writing on the wall we

00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:39,669
need to move on to the cloud or yeah

00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:41,409
they usually don't say like open source

00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:43,539
or Jupiter or anything like that they

00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:45,039
just say the cloud and we just you know

00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,269
kind of a interpret that to mean yeah

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,839
yeah okay well we'll give you some

00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:52,149
Jupiter and some Python and and then the

00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:55,509
one of the big obstacles they have is

00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:57,219
hey look we hand people like AWS

00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,289
instances and they just look at us stare

00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:02,229
at us like you know we have four horns

00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:04,209
in our head so a lot of what we do is

00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:05,409
sort of come in and provide that enable

00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,569
mint and I think what we've seen is that

00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,789
that kind of certification what the

00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:10,899
organization says hey you know we're

00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,339
gonna work with data incubator and they

00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:16,179
didn't convince those this training and

00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:17,769
then will certify you as a you know data

00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,599
scientist within our company that can

00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:22,299
have a motivating effect and it's often

00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,369
actually that kind of training is often

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,259
targeted towards actually citizen data

00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:28,169
scientists people who've kind of wanted

00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:33,219
to be able to do this and have that

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:35,529
internal motivation and this is a it's

00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:37,329
like a it's a way of sort of getting

00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:38,559
rewarding them it's a way of making them

00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:40,929
much more productive and then makes them

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,669
sort of an evangelist for Jupiter and

00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,919
Python and these all these open-source

00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:48,549
tools I think where the certification

00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,899
sometimes kind of can rub people the

00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:51,429
wrong way as one if you're sort of like

00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,899
well you can't touch this data set

00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:53,940
unless you're certified right I think

00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:55,260
that's

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,150
I mean obviously there could be some

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,800
sensitivity issues around that but it's

00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:02,250
usually not as sort of a skills-based

00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,810
sensitivity as much as it is kind of you

00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,650
know for national security reasons or

00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:10,110
whatever but then I think what we've

00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:13,050
seen is that the other half of that is

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:16,140
sometimes people who are let's say

00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:18,060
legacy analysts if you will I call I

00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,740
like to call them data signed like proto

00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:23,820
data scientists or kind of data analyst

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,800
1.0 they are sort of saying like look I

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,480
do a little bit of math I write some

00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,920
code that guy also does a little bit of

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,300
math and write some code why is he

00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,130
getting paid with so much more than I am

00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,710
and I think there's kind of an almost an

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,770
education that has to happen where you

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:41,130
explain why the modern tooling is more

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,930
powerful than what people are used to I

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,310
remember being in the training and

00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,230
somebody's sort of saying like this is

00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:49,260
incredibly frustrating how does this fit

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,700
within sequel and our point being like

00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,140
this doesn't fit within sequel that's

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,150
the point it's more powerful than the

00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,460
tools that you used to be doing and that

00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,780
that's sort of like you know what people

00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:04,710
get that I think they often want to move

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:08,490
ahead so just to add to Michael for

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:10,230
Michael's point um I I would address it

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,240
in a slightly different way I would go

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,680
back to demand and supply right so

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,600
earlier we had data at X which used to

00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,700
be a lot of business folks doing a lot

00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,130
of business insights lose using a lot of

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,470
sequel using a lot of Excel certainly

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,210
what happened data exploding we had

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,190
machine learning statistical modeling

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,400
theoretical ideas being done in research

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,990
community when the deal I exploded

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,070
people wanted to apply to different use

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,530
cases we didn't think of doing

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,940
personalized search result Google

00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,770
actually started doing it or Yahoo

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,050
started doing personalized finance

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,420
reports and stars so what happens the

00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:47,400
application started changing and there

00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,190
was a gap where things could not fit

00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:53,160
into Excel and the BI insights that were

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:55,110
getting generated were shortscope and so

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,730
then figured out what we have to go back

00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,260
to academia back again and so the

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,060
research we started taking help from the

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,830
research community and then the whole

00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,350
idea of machine learning researcher came

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,030
along data engineers came along and then

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,450
the idea of data scientist kind of

00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,029
brought up which

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,429
is a combination if you ask me a lot of

00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:14,769
the times so so two things what is

00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:17,110
machine learning or a lot of times to me

00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:19,630
to me from my prospectus is a lot of

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:23,399
times automating the Automator right so

00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,720
we have had a good example of this is

00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:27,399
car manufacturing companies we have

00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,500
robots who have been assembling

00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:32,320
automated pipe you know production

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,240
pipelines for so many years so that's a

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,220
pipeline that is standardized and we

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,440
know we can automate it so it's a

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,419
defined use case but a lot of the other

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,210
places it's not defined it's very hacky

00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:45,220
one has 200 distributed systems one has

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,889
to handle maybe Python one has to handle

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,809
our Julia and I don't know SAS kernels

00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:51,639
and whatnot and certainly it's like

00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,200
multiple combination of so many skills

00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:54,970
so a lot of the time data scientists are

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,740
just hackers trying to put together

00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:00,820
different things integrating and make

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,799
something work and that that I think

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:06,309
kind of has created a little bit of

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,289
tension with respect to the data analyst

00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:13,120
or the data citizens if we want to call

00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:15,909
them and and and folks was the other

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,529
thing that we were saying citizen did a

00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:19,480
scientist and to certify data science

00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:23,620
and to certify people who are doing data

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,539
science and so so that has created

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,120
attention and from my perspective I

00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:31,120
think the world is so big there is

00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,889
existence of both of them business

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,059
insights is very valuable which a lot of

00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:35,320
the times I have felt from my

00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:37,720
perspective working with different

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,850
researches a lot of times research is

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,080
Lucy perspective what exactly the

00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,049
business insight that needs to be

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,389
considered and bi folks may have the

00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:48,549
thing that they may not handle so many

00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:50,529
gara using different languages together

00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:52,510
so maybe there could be a UI component

00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:54,070
that they could be more flexible in

00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,919
using that could handle this big data

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,809
and and and you know and then toolings

00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,870
like Auto ml and this kind of stuff

00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:03,909
which is again helping solve returned in

00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,340
use cases where the BI analysts giving

00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,929
them lot more power to solve they use

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,819
cases in a way that they could define

00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:12,429
better and obviously there's a lot more

00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:15,940
use cases which has not been explored

00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:17,770
and heterogeneous data where more people

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,540
who are like you know data scientists or

00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,220
EMA researchers can actually handle it

00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,069
much

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:25,349
so in my opinion I think there is this

00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:27,539
tension but I think there is well which

00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:32,879
the world is so big that both can exist

00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:37,169
in a very cohesive way oh yeah obviously

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,309
saying it's I think that it really but

00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:41,399
what matters here

00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:43,169
it's the output where we want to get

00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:46,619
right is this concept of inputs and

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:48,659
outputs we can inject whatever we want

00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,730
to inject in a system we can have

00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,429
discussions around tension who is

00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:56,159
certified who is not certified but where

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:59,369
do we where are we trying to go we're

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,049
trying to get to a position where we can

00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:02,730
leverage the benefit of artificial

00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:05,220
intelligence machine learning and

00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,989
accelerate the process of inventing and

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,630
creating and getting all of these things

00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:11,819
done and to get that done things that

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,730
have worked in the past is opening

00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:16,739
access to knowledge right when when

00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,019
access to knowledge was limited to a few

00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:21,420
people well it was limiting the

00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:23,130
innovation process as well that happened

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,109
with github that happened with the open

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,029
source movement and what I believe is

00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:29,430
happening now which citizen data science

00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:32,130
is opening the open access to machine

00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:34,230
learning capabilities so who cares if

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,779
there is tension we want people to have

00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,160
access to knowledge to be able to build

00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:40,680
things because the more you share the

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,720
more people can innovate and that's a

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,670
fundamental approach we have at Amazon

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,950
for the past many years I mean I joined

00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,450
Amazon five years ago and we had a

00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,400
discussion Paco I run the big data

00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,470
engineering support team before and at

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,509
the time I have a feeling that it's it's

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,950
almost the same conversation that was

00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:58,440
happening five or six years ago about

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,019
Hadoop and big data where the new rules

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,430
like Hadoop engineers were coming up and

00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:04,440
then that was bringing in a financial

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:07,289
incentive and there was tension but look

00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,089
at what happened now it's standardized a

00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,039
little bit it has plateaued and now

00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:13,499
people get two different levels of

00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,480
certifications and specialization and no

00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:17,700
one worries about who gets access to the

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,069
knowledge or not right I feel like

00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,480
that's that's what needs to happen with

00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:23,130
machine learning and that's what that's

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,630
what we've been investing heavily into

00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,509
so we run this machine learning

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,789
University inside Amazon we've been

00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:31,319
doing that for years where anyone would

00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:33,170
approve of their manager you can just

00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,089
come and get access to all

00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,640
the knowledge that is required and what

00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:39,410
we do at Amazon sage maker is that we go

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,790
to these internal teams and we say well

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,190
what are the cool things that you've

00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,079
built in the past and how can we bring

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,210
that out into the hands of a lot of

00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,369
other people including some of the

00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,799
advanced algorithms that we actually use

00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:53,329
for our own purposes and we package that

00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:54,829
and bring it out so that people can

00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:58,339
actually use that in innovate and what

00:36:54,829 --> 00:37:00,170
we've realized is that your advantage of

00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:02,119
having you know build your business on

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,780
top of a specific algorithm like deep

00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,819
autoregressive you know forecasting it's

00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,430
not going away because you share that

00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:12,440
algorithm you can still innovate while

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,640
other people innovate and potentially

00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,609
generate something that you can learn

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,230
from so we're all in for I'm not gonna

00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,630
use the word democratization because

00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,670
everyone is using that but we all we all

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,799
in for you know opening access to

00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,680
knowledge and creating new rules and you

00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:28,970
know incentivizing people into learning

00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,349
the skills and certifying them that's

00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,900
okay certification is up to the

00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:35,119
certifier right so I think it motivates

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:41,329
people to to actually get you know on

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:43,430
the train so I I love the term DIY

00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,230
analytics because I think that is that

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,720
is the best way to describe this right

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:51,260
you can have somebody do a DOI a home

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,140
remodel and that person could spend a

00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,119
lot of time and research and deliver a

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,290
great remodel and then you could have

00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:58,970
somebody who just kind of wings it and

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,650
they have all kinds of problems and you

00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,359
could have the same person who does both

00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,990
things into different remodel projects

00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,000
right

00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,619
same thing with all of the the data

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,700
science products or any of the analytics

00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:11,480
that we create so the approach that

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:13,849
we're taking is more of a certifying the

00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,760
data set or the data product rather than

00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:19,579
the person and we are trying to measure

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,180
the quality of the data set or the data

00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:24,440
product and also surface the you know

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,730
like the various stages that this goes

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,140
through so like let's say that I create

00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,849
something and it's more for ad hoc or

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,430
one-off purpose or maybe I just need to

00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:33,260
share it with my team that data set can

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,260
become discovered by other people and

00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,780
that's not a problem until it's a

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,730
problem right and that point like what I

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,869
what I really need to do is not limit

00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,220
people from being able to create those

00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,540
data sets I don't want to limit them

00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,280
from being able to discover it but I

00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,010
need to let the data owner

00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,510
know that somebody outside their team is

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,670
starting to consume that so that they

00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,500
realize at this point they become a

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,700
dependency for somebody else or the

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,860
point at which becomes a production

00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,140
dependency even more so you know we need

00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,800
to now apply higher levels of rigor and

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,000
quality right so so rather than I would

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,370
say like sort of find the individual

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,440
it's more of like certifying what it is

00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:11,360
that you're doing and does this meet the

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:23,720
overall quality standards that we have

00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:26,180
for this exactly exactly if we tried to

00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,100
put those restrictions in place then

00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,200
we're gonna slow down everybody that has

00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,400
these ad hoc needs right we don't want

00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,870
to do that we want to do things that

00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,300
make sense and there's a point in the

00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,980
lifecycle of a data product at which we

00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,670
care about these things and there's a

00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,670
point at which we don't

00:39:47,690 --> 00:40:26,990
I can start so so so it's it's a good

00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:28,400
it's a great question of all question of

00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,380
what Michelle was saying that instead of

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,829
certifying a person we certify the

00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,390
process and with respect to the

00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:37,579
introduction of the bias like I was

00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,960
saying that a lot of times we as humans

00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:40,640
so how is this data getting collected

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,550
somebody was saying with respect to

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,800
Google Maps so the way we travel the way

00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,810
we do our transactions we as humans

00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,880
depending on a taste and ideas and what

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,680
we prefer we make certain decisions we

00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,170
like an ad we don't like an ad and each

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,990
of this is actually being used to build

00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,369
another model so the bias could be

00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:01,369
introduced during the data collection

00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:03,230
process as well now when we work in an

00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:04,369
enterprise setup when we are when we

00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,500
have thousands and thousands of

00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:08,690
individual it's very difficult to keep

00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,140
track of each and every feature that is

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:16,250
actually being used and whatnot but

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:20,349
before the model is actually built one

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:22,940
could ask a question to make sure that

00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:23,569
me as the person who is building this

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,430
model

00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:29,930
am I being biased to a particular I just

00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,970
like you know use race as an example am

00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,890
i considering or having a feature which

00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,510
is totally correlated with race that I'm

00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,240
considering into the feature that might

00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,310
help in moving the profit quite a lot

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,130
but I don't know if it's an ethical

00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,680
model that we have and a lot of these

00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,640
problems are coming up right so

00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,310
sometimes I work on Twitter there was a

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,650
discussion on YouTube as to how they

00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,240
consider the sorts of datas that may not

00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,730
be ethically standard but then again

00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:00,170
they have to move the business ROI as

00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:01,250
well so I think we kind of I for me

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,220
personally it's a very

00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,870
difficult question to answer in and what

00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,240
exactly should we ask ourselves and the

00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,950
reason is this whatever we do whether

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,050
it's a certified with a citizen data

00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:14,780
scientist or not a lot of times this

00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,940
matrix has to drive an ROI if the dollar

00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,560
or the profit is not increasing people

00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,450
start asking questions about the

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,880
initiatives as to why this thing or

00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,160
money is being spent and so at that

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,470
point in time this you know this thin

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,120
line with between making sure that the

00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,190
business is driving profit and how the

00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,540
data is coming in it kind of becomes

00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,160
very troublesome because a lot of the

00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,810
times the data is never of the quality

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,240
that would actually help in driving the

00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:40,010
business problem and we start in

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,500
thinking in terms of like how what kind

00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,720
of feature do I consider to you know to

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,390
maximize the profit like we were talking

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,430
about zip code earlier zip code could be

00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,380
a good indication as to how which house

00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,850
is going to be most expensive in the

00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,100
next couple of years depending on the

00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:57,320
population that is shifting there now

00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,870
these are some hard facts which are

00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,700
there and if one has to make sure that

00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,640
the mall is doing good in predicting the

00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,960
house price I mean I don't know all

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,250
right right now at this point in time

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,140
found the person who is building the

00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,210
model and you know the stake is on me

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,130
I don't know what features else to

00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,630
consider if zip code is the only one

00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,360
which is closely associated to the

00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:20,330
feature to the ROI and so it becomes a

00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,250
very conflicting problem what I thought

00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,650
right now is that maybe at least we

00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:27,920
could raise our hands and inform the

00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,930
organization that this is what it is and

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,420
then adhere to the process that has been

00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:34,430
established or bring up questions how we

00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,940
can certify some some process associated

00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,940
with it

00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,600
I think there's a couple things that you

00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,160
can consider and I think it depends on

00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,260
what kind of organization you're part of

00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,880
and the situation that you're in but I

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,770
think the most important thing is simply

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,090
transparency on what you're doing if

00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,580
you're transparent on what you're doing

00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,830
if you're a part of a organization that

00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,690
you cannot share publicly what you're

00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:58,280
doing then within the organization at

00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,750
least you can be transparent from the in

00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,640
most cases it's not in all cases but in

00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,230
most cases you need to be transparent

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,060
and put it out there for an opportunity

00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,200
to get feedback on it's like you would

00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,660
for a product or something like that

00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,070
oftentimes we have products internally

00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,579
our products externally where we get

00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,619
customer feedback on

00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,839
that product works treat your model as a

00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,609
product in itself you know ask for

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,959
feedback on what things you might be

00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:20,519
need to think about that you didn't

00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:21,989
think about before or what about

00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:23,999
including these variables does this make

00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:26,279
sense or is this a problem the other

00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:28,259
thing that I would add and I apologize I

00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:29,099
cannot remember exactly the title of the

00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:31,079
book but I believe the book is

00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:34,200
unconscious pilot bias from I'm not

00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,809
mistaken which i think is an excellent

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,229
book to really help you think about ways

00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:41,339
that you may be approaching problems

00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:42,989
incorrectly or how you might be it might

00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:44,279
be actually how biased there and you

00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:45,989
just don't even realize that it's there

00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:47,789
because a human being is we get used to

00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:49,529
certain things and we we don't actually

00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:50,729
realize that maybe we're thinking about

00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:53,279
something a certain way and that's

00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:54,269
actually bias in and of itself so those

00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:55,099
are really the two things that I would

00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:59,219
consider

00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:02,849
yeahit's are quickly add that agreeing

00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:05,869
with him and I think the whole point of

00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:09,269
the question and the discussion is

00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:12,829
really in my opinion the most important

00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:15,779
thing I'm a big believer in

00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:19,229
Interdisciplinary you know teams and

00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:21,509
practices so just having the machine

00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:23,849
learning practitioner augmenting the

00:45:21,509 --> 00:45:25,410
team with the type of people that can

00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:27,089
bring the second perspective and that

00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:29,219
could be customers that could be

00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:31,979
colleagues and other things we've really

00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:33,479
seen that working well overall now we

00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,489
can design and we can talk about the

00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:36,719
specifics within the model but really

00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:39,660
trying to make sure that you get

00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:42,299
external feedback as you collecting the

00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,009
data as you selecting the algorithms

00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:46,199
that you're going to use as you

00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:48,900
evaluating your models for performance

00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:50,239
and as you re collecting data after the

00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,920
model is out for production for

00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,599
revaluation or retraining in all of

00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,309
these phases trying to have an external

00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,099
opinion and the fact that we're having

00:45:56,309 --> 00:46:02,269
this discussion is already showing that

00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:04,380
we're going in the right direction I

00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:08,219
think we need to change the discussion

00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:10,109
here to say we know every single person

00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:11,640
is biased it is impossible not to be

00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:13,019
biased and we need to normalize it

00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,049
normalize that discussion and change the

00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:18,119
question of is this model bias to how is

00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:19,949
this model biased which is why I think

00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:21,719
things like reproducible research become

00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:24,269
really important transparency become

00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:24,940
really important and I think that that's

00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:26,170
part of

00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:46,420
we need to be doing to solve this but I

00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:50,859
don't think there's any easy answer I'm

00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:54,910
just this is their conversation going on

00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:56,800
along the lines of ethical testing just

00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:59,380
like we have functional testing we have

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,079
the unit testing what if there was a

00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,450
consortium that put together a framework

00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,099
for lt-col testing and just like you

00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,810
know you certified buildings for being

00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:11,079
green buildings or LEED Platinum

00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:12,579
buildings where as a wall like it's a

00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,470
volunteering thing where somebody comes

00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:16,990
in and say yes I want my building to be

00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:19,829
certified and I am putting my hand up to

00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:22,380
put the framework so that my building is

00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:25,240
green certified or Platinum certified

00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:28,210
what if there was a consortium of like I

00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:32,079
am exposing my system to be tested for

00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:38,950
ethics and this open you know testing

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:40,329
framework whatever system you're

00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,369
building whatever you want to get

00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:44,079
certified and spits out an indicator

00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:45,849
like hey this is what do you think just

00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,190
these are the bias points where this

00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:49,990
system is biased there's at least one

00:47:48,190 --> 00:48:04,300
open-source framework along those lines

00:47:49,990 --> 00:48:06,400
from you Chicago all trying to go and I

00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,760
think this is where Julius went around

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,010
like the Hippocratic oath and being able

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,510
to define what that ethics is what that

00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,650
line is is probably like the very first

00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,240
step before we could really look at

00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:23,140
those frameworks and have anything

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:25,780
effective come out of them there was a

00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:28,420
and I'm forgetting the whole discussion

00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:31,359
around this take a look at the National

00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,680
Academies report on data science for

00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,170
undergraduates because they've got a

00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,960
whole discussion in there about the

00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:40,089
different options of of it and

00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,380
they're much more expert in it than I am

00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:43,780
and I can't remember the details but

00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,490
they it was a really robust and

00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,800
thoughtful discussion by some of the

00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,200
experts in the field so it's National

00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:54,000
Academies data science for the social oh

00:48:50,200 --> 00:49:03,460
sorry data science for undergraduates

00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:05,440
curriculum yeah just up to that point

00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,359
that you mention about some sort of a

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,369
consortium so I think that is one a

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,960
governing body which i think is getting

00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:13,089
formed there is one of the problem which

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,880
is there is that the smalls they get

00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:18,280
very complex and there is a tooling gap

00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,990
as well as to how do we go about how do

00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,030
we enable the to ask people this

00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,230
question or you know all analysts or

00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,990
data scientists or machine learning

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,420
researchers why did this happen why did

00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:31,300
the model make this prediction and

00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,980
there's a lot of you know cohesive

00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,040
collaboration going on in research and

00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,230
industry as well how to shorten this gap

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:45,730
and to help governing bodies you know

00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:47,290
define and ask this questions more so we

00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,660
said there are like multiple things

00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:53,260
which are associated with it right so so

00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:57,220
for example in when we typically work in

00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,900
any set up 50 I believe that there are

00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,280
two personas right one who is a model

00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,809
maker like you were mentioning about

00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,540
unit testing right so if we draw an

00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:06,609
analogy to software engineering we have

00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,040
developers and we have QA engineers and

00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:10,540
developers are building writing code QA

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,760
engineers are trying to hit against the

00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:15,130
code attack it and break it and that has

00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,290
helped us in defining this source the

00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:19,750
software engineering paradigm I feel

00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:22,150
that there is a similar initiative that

00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,190
has been started and the scenarios are

00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,530
personas a model maker and model breaker

00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,900
model maker is anyone it's a certified

00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:30,460
data scientist it's a ml researcher

00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,280
whoever it is doesn't matter and there's

00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,640
a mold maker so breaker mall breakers or

00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,500
business folks government officials any

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,750
other governing bodies with respect to

00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:44,470
privacy policies and so on who have the

00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:46,180
ability to ask the model why what why

00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,349
did this decision happen what are the

00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,329
key features that are there and

00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:49,890
depending on the organization and their

00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:52,080
need

00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:54,110
and the regulations that they have to

00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:58,380
govern to they have the ability to

00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:01,140
enable transparency as needed so you

00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,390
know so and on that aspect we had open

00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:06,140
sourced a project called skater with the

00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:08,520
idea as to how can we enable this

00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:10,800
enabled easily to ask this question why

00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,160
and debug the model and identify what's

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,160
going on

00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,910
