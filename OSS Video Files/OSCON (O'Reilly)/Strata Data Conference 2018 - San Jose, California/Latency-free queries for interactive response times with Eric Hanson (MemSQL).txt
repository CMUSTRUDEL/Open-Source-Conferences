hi this is my Kendrick center strata

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,250
date in San Jose I'm here with Eric

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,859
Hanson from MC coy Eric how you doing

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,719
good so how was the event event been for

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,820
you so far so it's been really exciting

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,160
to see what's going on in big data and

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,379
data analytics it's been good and so you

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,130
guys gave a keynote today that talked

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,380
about latency free and that's really

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,650
cool so can you explain a little bit

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,119
what you're trying to get - sure so we

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,070
want to be able to run queries with

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,199
interactive response time like down to

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,510
like a quarter of a second on huge data

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,739
sets while you're updating them so

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,540
that's pretty much what it means to be

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,140
latency free for us and so if your

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,270
latency free your your platform is going

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,289
to allow or your technology is going to

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,600
allow other companies to do faster AI or

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,149
make decisions quicker or have their

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,890
apps react quicker what so is the whole

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,960
goal there so what what we're really

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,850
good at is real-time analytics so as the

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,219
data is changing in an operational

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,910
system we capture it in the mem sequel

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,769
and then we are able to query it really

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,010
really fast so that people can do and

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,260
analytical queries on that new data in

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,180
like sub-second time or even down below

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,549
a quarter of a second so as the data is

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,470
changing we can query it really fast and

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,810
with high concurrency and you're not

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,759
talking just about little teeny pieces

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,790
of data you're talking about massive

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,189
datasets right right like billions or

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,820
trillions of rows even even trillions

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:34,909
and in sub-sect sub-second right level

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,350
right and so someone like NASA or a

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,820
aerodynamics company or companies like

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,439
that that's going to be crucial for a

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,810
lot of them is anybody that has a lot of

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,750
business events coming from business

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,990
process or reading telemetry off

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,850
computer systems or sensor data that

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,920
kind of thing could make use of it and

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,200
so where do you see where do you see

00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,210
this going like which which industries

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,759
need this the most so sure Financial oil

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,560
exploration media and communication

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,680
those are some of our verticals that are

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,830
using them sequel and so does this

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,790
latency free scale as well I mean you're

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,439
working on big

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,930
but can you scale it out as well as up

00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,060
so yeah we scale out so we split the

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,829
data across multiple computers we call

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,469
them leaf nodes in our architecture and

00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,989
by you can split it across as many nodes

00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,390
as you want to scale to arbitrarily big

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,040
data sizes and does a leaf node fit into

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,049
a tree or something or how would it was

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,000
so it's it's just it's just two levels

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,120
we have aggregators on top and Leafs on

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,980
the bottom okay yeah and in an architect

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,409
that's building a data system do they

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,439
have a hard time specifying that or is

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,090
it easy to so um it takes it takes some

00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,519
practice but our sales engineers are

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,290
good at like looking at the use cases

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,389
that our customers have and helping them

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,609
size the the clusters in advance and

00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,889
then if they need to they can grow it so

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,720
you know they can add nodes and

00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:03,030
rebalance the data to growth and grow

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,639
their clusters and are you seeing at a

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,799
big reception with this in the industry

00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,159
I mean are your customers excited about

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,049
this

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,849
sure so so we have you know we have a

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,919
customer in the oil exploration area

00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,930
that's used taking telemetry off of

00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,090
their sensors from the drilling

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,449
apparatus we have another financial

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,729
customer that is has a real-time

00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,440
application for people to explore their

00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,479
stock portfolio and they flip the

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,250
smartphone application open and it

00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,870
paints the screen in sub second time

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,909
after running over a hundred queries

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,010
against MEMC cool so it's really fast

00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,930
interactive sort of premium experience

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,310
so now there's a some of the things

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,519
people are being able to do with our

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,949
product so where does mem sequel sit in

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,569
a data stack I mean you here's the metal

00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,299
down here are you guys the next layer up

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,769
or where are you so we're we're an SQL

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,680
relational database so we're the

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,120
foundation of the platform typically you

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,069
know people run you know store their

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,650
data permanently in mem sequel if they

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,569
want to and run queries against it other

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,790
scenarios they have like a master copy

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:08,340
of the data and say Oracle or a Sybase

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,709
system and chain do change data capture

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,859
to replicate it into mem sequel in real

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,320
time and they can we can query a copy of

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,060
the data from there but do it faster do

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,799
analytical queries without perturbing

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,510
the source system maybe a product and

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,610
customer data in that sort of spin up

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,949
database any kind of event data you know

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,560
you know high-volume events typically

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,020
yeah okay so if you and I sat down

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,500
twelve months from now and have this

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,240
conversation what are you gonna tell the

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,729
people here at strata data that's

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,020
changed for you change for you guys mmm

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,509
sequel what are you going to be doing

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,389
differently very interesting questions

00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,310
so right now our sweet spot is real-time

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,409
analytics sort of as a what we call an

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,090
operational data store where we copy

00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,949
data from a source system and then

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,159
analyze it you know quickly after it's

00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,779
been born with analytical queries and so

00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:00,550
we're gonna and then there's there's

00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:02,680
transaction processing and data

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,379
warehousing is or sort of in the middle

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,969
of the two and we're going to continue

00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,550
to be become a better and better

00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,590
operational data store but then sort of

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,750
broaden out into transactions and data

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,310
warehousing until we can cover that kind

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,319
of the whole pie we're sort of the next

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,439
generation general-purpose database

00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,840
product and we're just growing stronger

00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,520
and stronger over and next year I think

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,159
you'll see they'll recovering a bigger

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,710
slice of that whole whole picture and if

00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:31,120
you could put on your industry hat let's

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,680
have that same conversation twelve

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,729
months from now what do you think the

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,259
industry is going to be doing

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,259
differently what do you think will be

00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:40,860
the big thing on everyone's radar next

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:44,680
year I mean this year it seems it's M

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,539
LDL and AI right are the darlings what

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,300
do you see in that on the horizon next

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,680
year so of course it was continued son

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,539
of some of the trends from this year

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,279
that you know that interest in ml will

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:58,750
continue the interest in real-time data

00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,759
platforms will continue and so I think

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,469
that you know real-time analytics is

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,080
going to continue to grow the ability to

00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:07,509
do both transactions and analytics in

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,979
the same system just can simplify your

00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,199
architecture you won't need as many

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,360
products and then those real-time

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,069
analytical systems will continue to work

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,650
better and better with big data and

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,389
machine learning type systems excellent

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,009
Eric we look forward to that

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,969
conversation next year at this all right

00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,969
thanks Mike thank you

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,199
