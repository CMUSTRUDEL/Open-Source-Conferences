hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,080
data in San Jose I'm here with Ian

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,910
Swanson from data science comm Yeun how

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,219
you doing great thanks I mean like so

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,679
you're the founder yep and CEO founder

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,199
CEO data science comm and what is the

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,310
main thing that you guys do yeah so data

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,020
science talk call us around for four

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,869
years and what we do is we provide a

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,090
enterprise data science platform what

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,210
that means is data scientists need to

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,380
work with many tools in many languages

00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,260
leveraging a lot of open source

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,329
libraries and so we provide a platform

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,370
that pulls that all together and it also

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,020
backs it up with the workflows and the

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,820
infrastructure that's needed to get work

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,129
into production and drive real results

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,440
from a data science team and so what

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,600
sorts of companies do you work with the

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,450
most or industries I mean yeah so we've

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,640
seen quite a change even the last four

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,860
years of being around meaning we

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,199
primarily used to work in technology

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,670
groups within large companies but data

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,680
science snails for every industry

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,489
business I mean every industry whether

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,049
it's in manufacturing - biotech large

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,909
technology companies - retail

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,070
everyone's invested in data science and

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,810
data science also is for every part of

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,030
the org so there's data science use

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,270
cases in the finance department and HR

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,890
in tech even in sales enablement so you

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,540
know to answer that question every

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,670
industry and there's so many different

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,860
use cases well so in every industry

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,350
seems like it's under some sort of

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,479
transformation digital transformation so

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,210
what is the role that data science has

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,979
with that transformation so first let's

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,939
start with you mentioned the key key

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,640
term there that we're hearing a lot

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,430
digital transformation so on the desk of

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,710
every CEO every large enterprise is this

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,049
mandate of digital transformation so

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,810
what is that it's how do large companies

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,939
exploit all the data they have to one

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,530
increase revenue or reduce operation

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,460
costs and this could be with new

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,380
business models

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,600
it could be just improving existing

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,100
processes you know the company but it's

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,450
how do we actually use this data that

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,560
we've been collecting and that's part of

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,840
digital transformation and the role of

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,790
data science there is data scientists

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,409
are the engineers essentially of this

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,530
digital transformation so they have a

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,319
seat at the table now with the CEO and

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,849
it's really about how do we leverage all

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,910
these assets that we have and data

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,320
Sciences is the

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,810
capability helps push that forward so

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,160
when I look at transformation I see I

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,070
see a phenomenon where there's

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,050
disruptors small startups that are gonna

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,360
try to take over an industry Luber did

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,760
that years ago and there are large

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,620
incumbents that are trying to stay ahead

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,140
of the disruptors yeah

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,450
data science helps both of them correct

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,170
and I think you hit on a good point

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,870
there and that is large companies will

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,430
die unless they transform on the side

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,580
unless they leverage their assets and

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,550
there are great quotes out there of

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,280
business leaders ranging from Cisco to

00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,260
Oracle that are up on stage saying you

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,240
have to leverage AI you have to leverage

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,160
machine learning in order to compete in

00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,200
order to compete against the

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,580
up-and-coming companies but also against

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,880
you know the poor large enterprise

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,090
competition so do we really know what AI

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,700
and ml can bring to a transformation

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,140
right now because is there sexy terms

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,420
right now and everyone's talking about

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,990
them but is anyone really making a

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,490
difference with them yet I think there

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,400
are examples of companies that are but

00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,760
to back up there the CEO of Google just

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,480
recently was quoted saying AI is as

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,920
important to us as a society as fire and

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,010
electricity I mean that's a bold

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,600
statement and my view on that is you

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,340
know it's bold but it's also saying this

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,660
is an exciting time this is an exciting

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,240
time to be in the field of data science

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,400
which encompasses AI machine learning

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,410
and deep learning now in terms of

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,640
companies realizing the full potential I

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,410
think we're still scratching the surface

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,120
of that tip of the iceberg yeah just tip

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,400
tip of the iceberg on that to where

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,250
that's why the Google CEO and others are

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,930
saying this is awesome this is gonna

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,160
transform business and by the way you

00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,930
better get on the train otherwise it's

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,540
going to leave you okay I remember that

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,930
same conversation in 1986 or something

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,320
like that

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm dating myself I get it but is it

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,709
really gonna work this time I mean now

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,110
because it has the notion has been

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,480
around for quite a while yeah have we

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,940
come to a point where the data systems

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,580
we now have can make AI and machine

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,200
learning real and expert systems and

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,360
neural nets and all those things that

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,640
have been around for a long time that

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,350
they've never really come to fruition

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,830
short answer is yes so what are the

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,810
building block

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,840
for success here on building blocks

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,430
start with data and we've been through

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,800
you know partnership out of Riley and

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,719
conferences like this we built out that

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,580
data story not just our company but many

00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:41,199
others around where do we store data how

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,969
do we get access to the data the next

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,530
step is a data science platform what are

00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:46,180
the tools to build to extract the value

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,860
from that and then if you go down it's

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,439
like how do we deploy this stuff in

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,750
production and so model deployment as an

00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,150
example so business can drive outcomes

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,340
from this models the stack exists now if

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,530
you went back four years ago it did

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,479
exist right and even if you went back

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,400
ten years ago the data story was still

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,469
starting to kind of begin around what's

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,180
a data like you know how do we you know

00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:09,039
leverage the data and now we have the

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,740
complete picture so our customers we

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,180
work with many Fortune 500 companies big

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,520
technology companies big biotech

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,440
financial service companies they are

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,180
putting models in production that are

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,279
going through digital transformation

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,139
reducing operation cost and increase in

00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,599
revenue the results are amazing

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:27,039
so if you looked forward 12 months from

00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:30,430
now what would you say

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,690
data science AI machine learning all the

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,800
technologies that accompany data science

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,639
what's the biggest impact they can have

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,120
on the planet

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,819
yeah well on the on the planets a pretty

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,759
pretty big agency board we're a planet

00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:48,849
yes yeah I think right now what we're

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,039
seeing is this this massive rise of open

00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,620
sources massive rise of technology in

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,139
the field of artificial intelligence ml

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,060
and deep learning a platform like ours

00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,589
helps the company to actually build a

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,900
harness all those open-source

00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:04,029
technologies and get value from them so

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,099
whether you're a large bank whether

00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,900
you're a non-profit you now have the

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,210
ability to go and leverage these

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,860
thousands and thousands of open source

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,199
technologies which by the way is growing

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,419
faster than proprietary technology and

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,190
then get it to a place where we can

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,860
actually generate results and so in

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,349
terms of the the benefit for society or

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,520
for our planet on that side you know

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,080
there's there's many companies that can

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,759
work on what are those actual results

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,250
but the technology is there the

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,389
technology can be used and can be used

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,699
in a way that could go into production

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,680
it can scale they can drive real value

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,180
that's a reality right now so why are

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
people still developing proprietary

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,449
software that's a question for some of

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,910
the other people here at this

00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:47,190
okay so if we sat down 12 months from

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,710
now yeah and we have a conversation and

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,229
I ask you what has changed in the last

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,389
12 months with data science com what you

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,340
want to say yeah so data sites are

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,660
calling the first thing is we're gonna

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,889
be growing you know we're growing fast

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,530
anyway so like I said we've been around

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,300
for four years we have big logos big

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,310
companies that we work with but I would

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,020
say twelve months from now we're gonna

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,310
be much more of a brand name you know

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,520
that's me recognized with the leaders of

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,949
tech you know in this space and for us

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,960
it's gonna be not just recognize our

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,850
name but recognize the value that we're

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,650
driving and the value is something that

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,080
a lot of other companies cannot claim

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,310
and that is you're storing data you're

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,199
getting access to data you're

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,060
visualizing data but now you actually

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
want to put data to action that's what

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,690
we're here to help them do and that's

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,500
what we're able to achieve excellent Ian

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,490
we look forward to that conversation

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,490
thanks so much
