	00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,190
we now have thanks to the internet a new

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,990
tool to understand the human psyche

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,540
people's google searches and people tell

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,370
Google things there are kind of secrets

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,220
things they might not tell to friends

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:22,380
family members doctors surveys I called

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,910
Google Digital truth serum and when you

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,680
analyze this data anonymous and

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,380
aggregate to protect everybody's privacy

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,920
you get an interesting new window into

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,360
the human psyche for example and I think

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,250
less and less we're gonna be using

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,480
surveys to understand people and more

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,809
and more we're gonna be using Google

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,550
Trends to understand people so the

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,469
different view of people on Google

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,329
people make more searches for porn than

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,250
for whether even though if you ask

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,600
people in survey only about 20% of men

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,410
and 4% of women admit to watching porn

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:59,070
particularly 100 percent admitted

00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:00,539
checking the weather and Google is

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,010
proving Google Trends data this

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,100
anonymous aggregate data is proving

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,680
better than surveys for many many

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,360
questions so for example it they're

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,340
better than surveys in predicting who's

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,010
gonna turn out an election you can't

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,880
really trust what people tell surveys

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,979
whether they're gonna vote because

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,479
people hate to admit that they're not

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,310
gonna exercise their civic duty they're

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,960
not gonna vote well you can predict with

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,729
high accuracy and the weeks before an

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,670
election if more people are searching on

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,759
Google how to vote where to vote turnout

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,009
tends to be high in those areas really

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,659
really sad but important it's been shown

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,950
that you can predict much better than

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,930
surveys suicide rates in an area by

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,939
again sad searches on Google how to kill

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,520
yourself suicide commit suicide

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,149
these predict with pretty high accuracy

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,189
suicide rates in an area now we can also

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,630
use this to measure racism this is how I

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,579
actually started my research I wanted to

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,350
see if Google trends can be used to

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,049
measure races in the United States if

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,170
you asked people in a survey are you

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,689
racist pretty much nobody in the United

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,970
States today admits to being racist it's

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,679
considered socially unacceptable to have

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,959
racist attitudes or at least it used to

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:20,239
be considered socially unacceptable but

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:22,760
people have people on Google when

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
they're alone and they're not talking to

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,379
anybody

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,150
dual Express with disturbing frequency

00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,010
racist attitudes this is the percent of

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,989
Google searches that include the n-word

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,580
not the n-word like not they're not

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:36,799
typing via n-word they're typing the

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,450
actual word and these searches are

00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,940
mostly for jokes

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,379
mocking african-americans a large

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,659
percent of these searches also include

00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,890
the word jokes and I was shocked by how

00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:47,480
frequently people are making these

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,640
searches this was searched in the time

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,440
period I was looking at with about the

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,420
same frequency as migraine and

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,890
economists and Daily Show and Lakers so

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,109
it wasn't a fringe search millions of

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,579
Americans were making these disturbing

00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:00,890
make these disturbing searches every

00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,900
year and I was also shocked by the

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,489
location of these searches if you had

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,010
asked me based on everything I knew

00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:10,129
about American history where racism

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,459
against African Americans were highest I

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,480
would have said south south south south

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,609
racism would be predominately

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,109
concentrated in the deep south and you

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:19,790
definitely do see with darker red

00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,230
meaning more racism that many of the

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,120
parts in the south are among the highest

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,489
southern Louisiana Southern Mississippi

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,870
dark dark red but right up there are

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,700
upstate New York and western

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,590
Pennsylvania Eastern Ohio industrial

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,750
Michigan I think the real divide and

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,910
racism these days isn't so much North

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,560
versus South it's much more East versus

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,730
West you see how it gets a lot lighter

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,060
as you get to the western part of the

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,060
United States

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,530
