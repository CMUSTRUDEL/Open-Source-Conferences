hi this is Mike Hendrickson Estrada deta

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,580
in San Jose I'm here with the nation' my

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,470
VM Dinesh how are you doing I'm doing

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,920
great so you get a great top this

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,620
morning and you talked about enterprise

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,789
ml can you unpack why that's different

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,240
than just ml right so if I have to look

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,220
at pure vanilla ml or an ml that you do

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,140
for a competition it's completely

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,740
different than an enterprise demo for a

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,510
few reasons there there are no cleanse

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,790
data set that nobody is going to give

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,100
you the data is sitting in silos if you

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,040
take a bank for example your personal

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,260
data is sitting in one Dana warehouse or

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,420
system right and then your you know

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,730
credit score is coming from a different

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,760
completely different system so you have

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,360
to bring all the data together clean the

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,719
data prep the data build the model test

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,829
and tune the model deploy the model

00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,539
monitor the model and it's that's a

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,460
cycle that's an iterative cycle that

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,050
could take you know a long time for you

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,219
to build the model competition is

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,780
different right because you get the

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,210
cleanse data you have a clearly defined

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,770
use case a problem to solve none of

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,979
those things exist in enterprise so the

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,869
enterprise ml I think is completely

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,689
different than what you do on a cable

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,150
competition and so this enterprise ml as

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,400
you said it's a cycle and that's a

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,049
continuous or fluid cycle it's not going

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
to stop because you're always gonna have

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,460
to keep it on and learning right is that

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,650
right so that's where you know at my

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,990
talk I talked about the fluid mo fluid

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,850
mo is basically an enterprise machine

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,759
learning model that's always on always

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,770
learning because it can never stop I

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,659
mean fraud doesn't stop at any second of

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,670
the day I mean every time they are

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,680
figuring out how to do fraud in a

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,170
different way so you got have it always

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,119
on and always learning that's where we

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,210
came up with the term fluid mo and

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,250
there's five pillars to the fluid mo and

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,329
if you can get all those five pillars

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,469
right then I think you have a really

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:00,240
well-thought-out underpriced machine

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,579
learning model ready to deploy and what

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,040
are those five pillars so you're testing

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,489
my memory but you know it should be able

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,009
to be measureable meaning how do you you

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,000
know monitor the model

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,950
it should be able to continuously learn

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,319
meaning how do you make sure that you

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,930
are the feedback loop to it to retrain

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,840
it using real-time data it has to be

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,239
performant meaning most enterprises want

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,340
the model scoring done in less than

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,620
milliseconds how do you make sure

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,409
Americans real-time model can score in

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,489
milliseconds it has to be resilient

00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:40,040
meaning if a data comes in now are you

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,840
ready to treat that error condition so

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,060
if you can bring all those pillars

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,340
together if you are done all those

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,799
pillars I think you're in a really good

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,620
good condition the scalability fit in

00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,690
resilience or yeah yeah ok it has to be

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,849
scale I mean you know because if you are

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,639
putting and modeled real time then

00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:00,500
obviously you need to be able to deal

00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,690
with thousands of transactions coming in

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,400
or even you know hundreds of thousands

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,099
of transactions so scalability is huge

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,620
so all those testing resilient meaning

00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,450
you know it should be able to treat the

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,299
air condition it should be elastic you

00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,639
should be able to scale so all those all

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:19,579
those parameters come under that

00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,530
particular umbrella we the folks at IBM

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:24,560
including yourself you guys work with a

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,349
lot of large enterprise companies and do

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,650
you see that any of them really have a

00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:33,019
good handle on building models for ml or

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,209
is that a struggle is that a ongoing

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:41,299
it's not easy to do right so I think I

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:43,579
think everybody is in agreement that

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,069
they need to infuse machine learning

00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,660
into their enterprise I don't think

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,359
there's not a single enterprise that

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,909
I've met who doesn't agree with that but

00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:57,470
the challenge is that how do you now

00:03:52,909 --> 00:04:00,169
bring that machine learning into your 40

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,519
50 hundred year old infrastructure that

00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:03,139
exists today right I mean you have

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,889
third-party application that you cannot

00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:08,540
touch you have legacy software that you

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,829
don't want to touch because if something

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,870
breaks it's your and the price comes

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,030
down tension silos around your company

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,039
yeah I mean you know and every division

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,650
has their own set of data they keep all

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,469
those so so that's the challenge that

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,940
enterprises face not the fact that you

00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,360
know they all agree that machine

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,389
learning

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,430
to be an integral part of their future

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:30,620
but how do they infuse the machine

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,569
learning I think when I look at machine

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,370
learning I call it the three B's and I

00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,830
got a lot of terror on you know what are

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,509
the three DS it's the data the

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,030
development of models in the deployment

00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:43,539
of models I would say and the prices

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,250
probably spend 80% of their time on the

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,110
cleansing of the data and the deployment

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,969
of the model the development of the

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,659
model is getting more and more automated

00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:54,979
I mean you know at IBM we have auto

00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:57,919
modeling for example and a lot of

00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:01,009
vendors do that so that piece is getting

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,840
more and more you know easier but the

00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,150
deployment of the model is very you need

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,509
experience you need the skills and you

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,129
need a lot of help the data cleansing is

00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,590
another piece you also definitely need a

00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:15,469
lot would you recommend building up and

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:19,039
on top of these old large legacy systems

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:22,069
or would you spin off a new cluster and

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,830
a new maybe division or right part and

00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:28,400
do it from the ground up I mean which is

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,949
the better build on or build out so if

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,110
you are building new applications

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:35,300
definitely that second piece makes more

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,969
sense but you know I mean if you are a

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,349
large bank that existed for 50 60 years

00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:44,750
you have existing infrastructure where

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:46,940
your transactions are running seamlessly

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,009
how do you make sure now you instead of

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,370
rules how do you put machine learning to

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:55,370
detect fraud those there is no way

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,830
around it you have to build machine

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,139
learning or learning into the existing

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,430
on top of the infrastructure I mean

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,560
there's no way around that we have seen

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,289
it over and over again I mean I'll give

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,029
you an example so we worked with the

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:13,849
major credit union in the United States

00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:16,129
about loan approvals and how do you have

00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:18,889
the model do the loan approval instead

00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,710
of the underwriter there is also we what

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:24,589
we learned is very interesting is that

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,150
the model itself was not approving some

00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:28,159
loans that's coming from a particular

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,139
zip code and all of a sudden you know

00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:31,789
that's where I talked about resilient to

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,680
make sure that how do you test the error

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,449
prone situations and it turns out one

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,050
underwriter wasn't giving loans

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,479
to a particular zip code so you know not

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,120
only it will expose a lot of things for

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,990
us but it will also help the enterprise

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,039
from three and a half hours to approval

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,199
auto loan

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,339
they've been two minutes using the

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,039
machine learning model so there's

00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:58,430
benefits but it's also exposes a lot of

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,819
the quirks that comes with you know the

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,189
previous way of doing loan approvals and

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,839
other things so you've worked with a lot

00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,479
of companies around the world can you

00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,539
identify maybe two or three things that

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,539
are the biggest challenges for large

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,360
companies to get started with machine

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:19,159
learning and then also could you also

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,409
identify what are going to be the

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:23,419
biggest three benefits right two or

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,699
three benefits right I mean I would say

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,810
if I have to summarize it the biggest

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:32,389
challenges are one identifying a problem

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,939
not every problem needs machine learning

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,620
but now there is this craze going on

00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:37,639
that you know we need to have machine

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,319
learning because everyone's doing it

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,120
right and some people are even saying

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,159
deep learning and my take is that I

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,649
would say 85% of our enterprises

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:52,189
challenges could be you know dealt with

00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,509
vanilla machine learning but people are

00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:55,159
going to the other extreme saying they

00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,139
will no I need deep learning and deep

00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,939
learning also has its benefits but it

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,399
also has its challenges you need

00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,899
tremendous amount of resources to do the

00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,509
training once you train what do you do

00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,520
with those associates right so so that's

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,529
one identifying a problem where you

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,110
really think machine learning needs to

00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,599
be in place that's the one to the data

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,520
because garbage in garbage out if you

00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:19,189
cannot get the clean data that becomes a

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,189
huge challenge and data today exists in

00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:24,110
silos in many enterprises if not all so

00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,810
how do you bring all the data cleanse to

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,419
do that the last but not least I would

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,219
say is the challenge that enterprises

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,899
once you build a model how do you deploy

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,269
that model how do you bring that into

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,740
your existing infrastructure those are

00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:38,779
the three challenges that we see over

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,219
and over again is you know and then

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,050
dispersion of skills all those things

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,600
are there but if I were to summarize it

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,490
as the core three challenges those are

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,030
the three now when we talk about

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:53,210
benefits I mean

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:58,890
huge one you have the benefit of now a

00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:01,140
machine that is available 24 by 7 it's

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,260
constantly learning so I'll give you an

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,290
example let's say you're an airline you

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,360
as an individual the airline has all the

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,790
data but now the machine is learning

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,340
that you like to go to a bar if you miss

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,280
the plane or you like to go home as soon

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,200
as possible or you like to get a you

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,630
know massage or whatever so based on

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,840
your likes and dislikes the Machine has

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:28,050
learned to make a prediction to send you

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,870
to the right agent right place

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,680
you know whatever else you need right so

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:39,050
I think the benefit is that we as

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:42,330
consumers will definitely benefit huge

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,560
from a serviceability perspective so the

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,870
corporation's will benefit by being

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,180
closer to their customers exactly that's

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,680
one course is another one right now all

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,500
of us and you have a machine doing

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,020
everything to a large extent so that's

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,250
that's another benefit and that and the

00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,590
third but not you know least is it gets

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,770
some into a next level of the playing

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:08,070
field because now you're not just making

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:11,250
decisions based on the past but you're

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,100
making decisions on real time based on

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,010
the real time data coming in so before

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,780
analytics was to be okay you take the

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,120
data put it in their data warehouse you

00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,580
run reports on it or you do analytics on

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,280
it but now it has become there is no

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,210
more analytics on data that's a day old

00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,070
or an hour or now it's data analytics or

00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,650
machine learning or predictability on

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,150
data that's seconds old so that's the

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,680
huge benefit so though I would say those

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,360
are some of the benefits that as an

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,250
enterprise that you get immediately

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,960
excellent well then as we look forward

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,580
to seeing you and your colleagues help

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,020
this unfold in enterprises thank you

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,020
thank you so much appreciate the time

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,160
