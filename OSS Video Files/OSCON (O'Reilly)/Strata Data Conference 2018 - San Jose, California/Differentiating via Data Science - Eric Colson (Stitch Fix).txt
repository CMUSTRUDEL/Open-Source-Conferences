	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
successful businesses have figured out

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,700
some way to differentiate themselves one

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,649
or more of these things that allows them

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,219
to command superior returns that are

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,679
sustainable in one new way to

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,299
differentiate is through data science

00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,220
changes in technology have made new data

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,140
available and the company that better

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,810
leverages that data is going to have an

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,210
advantage now if you're going to do this

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,609
differentiate by data science it cannot

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,500
be business as usual we cannot do the

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,269
same old company with the same old org

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,160
structure and same old roles and

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,860
processes things are going to have to

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,899
get different specifically we're gonna

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,730
have to rethink the role data science

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,140
plays in the organization and we're have

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,640
to create environment in which it can

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,440
thrive let's start with the role in most

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,780
organizations the role of data science

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,329
is merely supportive it enables

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,620
efficiencies but it's in service of some

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,989
other department that is ultimately

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,510
accountable but if you're going to

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,399
differentiate by data science the rule

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,070
has to include some elements of

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,000
ownership and accountability

00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,390
specifically I like to say these two

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,909
things

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,409
data science participates in the framing

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,150
of problems and data science

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,350
participates in the conception of ideas

00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,540
framing why is this important because

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,909
you don't want to limit your data

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,790
scientists to making only incremental

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,740
changes let me explain that I'm going to

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,950
use an example from nature to illustrate

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,840
this point this is the African giraffe

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,700
it's differentiation of courses that

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,130
longneck gives it an advantage for

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,340
getting up that high-end foliage it's

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,159
graceful it's elegant and so

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,960
appropriately designed or is it let's

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,450
look under the hood at the anatomy of

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,890
the giraffe okay we see some cogent

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,960
design we see enlarged heart and

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,409
arteries for pumping blood all the way

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,509
up the neck but what's this the

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,430
laryngeal nerve it's responsible for

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,799
sound it just needs to connect the brain

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,350
to the voice box and that's it it takes

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,140
this long detour all the way down the

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,659
neck and back up what happened here is

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,000
the initial framing was off we used the

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,310
mammalian blueprint which had the nerve

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,959
on the wrong side of the aorta see the

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,860
giraffe had an ancestor with a short

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,540
neck and through

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,710
the evolutionary process that Nick had

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,800
to get longer and longer and longer and

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,810
the nerve was stuck on the wrong side of

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,160
the aorta it got stuck so had to get

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,800
longer and longer making it less and

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,990
less efficient as a result giraffes

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,060
don't make much sound and this isn't

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,790
optimal and it can't be fixed

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,510
through evolution that's outside the

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:36,970
framing so the point is this framing

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,960
sets the course for initial design and

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,580
all future evolution once framed

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,040
typically only incremental changes are

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,750
possible and this can be limiting for

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,970
the giraffe it's stuck without the

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,480
ability to make much sound and this can

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,220
be consequential in business as well we

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,530
develop our own versions of laryngeal

00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,420
nerves things that are constraining yet

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,870
hard to change or even hard to

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,880
acknowledge for example you may tell

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,160
your data science to your data scientist

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,800
to go optimize something get us to the

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,690
top of that curve we tell her yet we

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,030
subconsciously subject her to

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,650
constraints initial framing that they're

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,120
asked to inherit we tell them you can

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,560
optimize but don't do anything else

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,780
terribly different than how it was done

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,880
in the past and this is constraining

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,610
they become invisible to us because

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,040
we're so used to it but they are there

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,959
and they are constraining and what we

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,560
thought was optimal may not be optimal

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,610
at all we're stuck in that plane

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,110
optimizing doing any incremental

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,500
improvements when we could have been up

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,980
there at the top of that curve in other

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,810
cases the framing prevents us some

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,580
seeing that we're solving the wrong

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,370
problem altogether we're optimizing the

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,170
wrong metric it took us a long time to

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,080
realize that pageviews was not a great

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,640
metric to optimize for and like a

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,100
laryngeal nerve we're stuck on that

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,850
black line and we could have jumped up

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,400
there to that blue line the point is

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,580
don't ask your data scientists to

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,310
optimize something instead ask them to

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,410
frame the problem proper framing can

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,480
give you a great intuition into how

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,950
things work both how they work now and

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,780
how they might work in the future and

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,489
you're going to be far more likely to

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,260
enable them to make both incremental

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,799
improvements as well as the step

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,799
function type

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,490
