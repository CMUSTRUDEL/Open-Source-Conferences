	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,540
data in San Jose I'm here with Jack

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,510
Norris from that part Jack how you doing

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,830
great great a year Mike good to see you

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,840
again so it's been about six months

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,910
since we talked and a lot changes in the

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,550
world yeah catch me up on what's changed

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,430
with you guys well I think if you take a

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,859
step back and look at the whole industry

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:26,670
increasingly the conversation is about

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,769
the data the underlying data you know at

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,019
the beginning of the early days of this

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,200
conference was more about the processing

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,760
up above right the the MapReduce and

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,730
then we talked about yarn and you know a

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,040
lot of lot of the components and and how

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm doing processing and I think the

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,719
realization the spotlight has moved to

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,140
the data because it's recognized that

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,510
the underlying data is the real area

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,340
that you'll succeed or not and McKenzie

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,420
did a study and said for data science

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,520
projects only about 20% of those are in

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,010
production and if you back that up with

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,189
some of the Gartner statistics on Hadoop

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,350
deployments were only 14% of those made

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,510
it into production successfully they

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,360
both point at the underlying data layer

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,729
as as the culprit and so that's the

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,850
backdrop is as we increasingly talk

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,070
about our data fabric that can stretch

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,030
across locations support a variety of

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,580
processing and support advanced machine

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,740
learning and AI because those are the

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,159
darlings of the world right now it's and

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,770
you have to have data is central to both

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
machine learning definitely I 90 percent

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,640
of success is data logistics for your

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,549
typical machine learning products so do

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,369
you make deploying this much easier get

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,490
your platform yeah what well for one

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,829
thing our deployment can support the

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,770
existing applications in existing

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,670
approaches side-by-side with would net

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,290
new especially true when you look at

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,049
containerization so we just announced

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,670
our our support kubernetes environment

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,350
where you can containerize all

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,110
applications you don't have to worry

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,000
about stateful applications or shared

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,849
data because it's easy to access that

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,890
across our platform regardless of where

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,030
you move that you can burst to the cloud

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,900
we provide all the kind of difficult

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,270
difficult things in terms of how you

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,640
synchronize how you place that data how

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,410
you protect it provide security is that

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,470
kind of like a data infrastructure yeah

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:32,820
I think data infrastructure data fabric

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,410
converged data platform there's there's

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,500
many ways to kind of refer to it and

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,709
what sorts of companies are looking at

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,360
that the most other industries that are

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,190
needing a whole transformation of their

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,110
data world that would need something

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,320
like probably the best way to explain is

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,250
not just specific industries but it's

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,470
the leaders within a particular industry

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,510
so it's kind of cross industry but you

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,489
know some of the leaders in financial

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,280
services that are looking at how do they

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,440
best leverage data not only for the the

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,739
kind of customer experience but for the

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,980
the better their ability to kind of

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,780
better manage mitigate risk and drive

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,590
operational efficiency and we're seeing

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,810
that in healthcare in telco and AD media

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,730
in oil and gas I mean it really kind of

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,580
runs the gamut so if they're the leaders

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,840
then then they're the the good stalwart

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,060
companies that have been around for a

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,000
while and continue to lead are you

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,860
seeing disruptors also wanting to do the

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,600
same thing because there's always

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,700
disruptors wanting to knock off the in

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,440
gentlemans yep and are they looking at

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,549
platforms like this as well because they

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,959
can scale quicker

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:45,810
well Deloitte has the this Center for

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,690
the edge and they've published in the in

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,370
the the latest kind of global technology

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,470
report the importance of data flows and

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,630
they projected in the next decade the

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,540
primary task of computing will be an

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,650
understanding and leveraging data flows

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,360
so they actually went through and

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,530
segmented public companies and said

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,390
there are traditional asset base

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,829
companies where the valuation is about

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:13,440
1x of revenues to orchestrators Network

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,180
orchestrators they get an 8x multiple so

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,370
the disruptors in their view are those

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,780
that are better able to kind of

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,479
orchestrate networks that's where the

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,669
ubers and the Airbnb is fall in so the

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,320
task for an organization is to look at

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,639
your business model and how do you

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,280
better position yourselves

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,129
to be at the the control point in your

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,960
ecosystem to understand the exchanges

00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,569
and data flows that are going on and

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,479
just to bring that back if you have a

00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,879
data Freya but it's a lot easier to not

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,710
only understand but but control those

00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,199
data flows and what does the data fabric

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:51,069
bring to a large enterprise I mean what

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,219
if you're a you know fortune 50 company

00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:57,249
and you're you're looking at you know a

00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:58,659
small startup that is really starting to

00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:01,060
eat around the corners of your business

00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,889
and you want to make sure you distance

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,289
yourself what do you do with the data

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:07,750
fabric well the the challenge for

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,550
organizations is that they're looking at

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,650
how do they do more with less right so

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,840
how do they simultaneously reduce costs

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,120
and drive innovation so number one a

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,810
data fabric is a means to do that you

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,879
can handle greater volumes of data much

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,069
less expensively right so it gives you

00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,629
that platform in which to innovate and

00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,699
then if you look at well how do you

00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,740
innovate traditionally we started with

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,650
applications that dictated the data and

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,689
had a series of silos and the challenge

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,449
now is it's not about the specific

00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:39,629
application it's it's my view across it

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,189
I'm not looking at this particular

00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:44,229
customer application I want to

00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:46,839
understand the whole customer experience

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:49,990
understand the whole business operation

00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:53,319
so what a fabric does is give gives you

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,139
more access to that data especially in

00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,050
between the the silos and allows you to

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:01,449
do operations in near real-time so it's

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,029
not analytics to put a spotlight to

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,009
describe what happened it's analytics to

00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,270
help you understand and make adjustments

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,969
while it's happening

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,699
awesome so latency free and some latency

00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,469
is the big culprit and that's the

00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,800
benefit of kind of squeezing this out

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:19,899
and doing things while the data is

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,539
arriving and understanding the context

00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:25,500
of that data so what's on map ours

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:28,060
roadmap coming up would say what's

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,680
foreshadowed the next six months what's

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,169
on your roadmap what would you like to

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,209
have you guys doing differently better

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:38,589
more effectively well I think B my

00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:40,060
favorite quote in the coverage we got

00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,090
this week was that if you want to

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,530
understand what

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,970
the other competitors will roll out the

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,120
next few years because what you're doing

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,790
look over doing today containers

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,860
containers that it's a great example

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:56,479
right so it it really it revolves around

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,590
kind of who you're looking at in the

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,220
organization so from the IT architect

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,060
that's looking at how do i best leverage

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,430
infrastructures everywhere from

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,780
on-premise to cloud to edge you know

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,460
we've got that fabric that stretches

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,610
across and gives them a lot of options

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,220
so you'll see kind of roadmap in there

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,590
to just further make that automated and

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,470
easier in policy driven if you look at

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,660
the developer it's it's about micro

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,580
services and containerized development

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,530
injecting machine learning and we've got

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,330
a bunch of things we've done there will

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,630
continue to push on that data science

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,760
refineries etc if you look at the whole

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,490
data ops approach of how do I get more

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,919
agile to support that the tools in place

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,470
to to be able to manage that effectively

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,449
and get a lot of leverage in terms of

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,430
the the singular things you do that

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,639
benefit across applications and then

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,380
from the sea level it's you're doing all

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,750
this for a for a reason you're doing all

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,220
this for a business impact or an

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,220
organizational impact of your federal

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,210
government etc so how do you tie that to

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,139
the mission how do you have a better

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,690
instrumentation and better kind of

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,289
applications and there I think we go to

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:12,169
the the data flows focus so that fabric

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:15,620
is not just another name for a lake or a

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:17,990
warehouse it's integrated data in motion

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,330
and data at rest that squeezes out the

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:25,099
latency to inject these these operations

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,330
so low late no latency is the future for

00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,710
everyone oh absolutely

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,500
we all want to get to that point where

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,450
