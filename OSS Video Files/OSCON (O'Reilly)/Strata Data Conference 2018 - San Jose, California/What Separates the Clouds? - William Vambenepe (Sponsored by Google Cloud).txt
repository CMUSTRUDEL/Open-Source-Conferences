	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
good morning William uh Burnett my

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,150
twitter handle is my last name if you

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,090
can spell it and if you like bad puns

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,710
and tweets about data processing and I

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,900
work for Google cloud that lead the PM

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,120
team for their processing services on

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,949
Google cloud but even though I work for

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,199
Google cloud even though I really like

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,480
competitive situations when I talk about

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,130
separating the clouds these are not the

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,600
clouds I'm talking about and so as soon

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,609
as I step off the stage I'm more than

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,220
happy to have those discussions I really

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,500
enjoy them but here today I'm going to

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,570
be talking about ok I'm one slide behind

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,860
mine in my in my deck that's that's why

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,540
that didn't make sense initially so

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,430
these are another cloud I want to talk

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,309
about the clouds I do want to talk about

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,590
are these clouds and specifically the

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,379
way they show up in satellite imagery

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,480
such as this where they have the really

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,910
annoying habit of obscuring what's

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,890
behind them you know sometimes you take

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,809
satellite images to see the clouds for

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,850
meteorology and then you love seeing

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,640
them other cases you want to see what's

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,739
under them and they become any reasons

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,680
and so in cases like this one it's

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,210
actually quite easy to find them and and

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,210
detect that they are obstructing the

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,770
view in other cases it can be quite a

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,420
bit harder especially when there are

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,360
mountains especially when there is snow

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,310
and clouds and snow have a tendency to

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,280
look alike and so now that's a real

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,380
example coming from Airbus which in

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,960
addition to building airplanes also has

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,240
a business selling satellite pictures

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,070
from their fleet of satellites and they

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,619
want to sell quality pictures to their

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,079
customers which means detecting when

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,930
clouds are obscuring the view so that

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,909
you can retake a picture you know when

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,100
the clouds are not there and so these

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,710
are the kinds of images and you know on

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,960
that one single image a trend operator

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,810
can pick out what's a cloud and what's

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,729
know but a trend operator cannot do that

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,369
on a thousand images per second and

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,829
satellites produce a lot of images very

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,530
quickly and people want to consume the

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,409
data quickly and so in this case Airbus

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,840
using terms of flow on Google cloud

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,240
measuring engine was able to create a

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,270
model that makes this determination

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,770
quickly and effectively and so hopefully

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,470
you were doing your homework as I was

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,440
talking kind of deciding if it's snow

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,160
out of the four white patches here now

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,160
times up

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,260
the answer is it's mostly snow but upper

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,360
right is clouds and so when the clouds

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,120
are trapped in the valley they actually

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,830
adopt the shape of the valley and so it

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
really don't look like clouds they look

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,700
more like snow deposits and so that's

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,730
the kind of thing the model has to do

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,340
reliably quickly across large amounts of

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,290
data now why does it matter you know

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,060
it's not just about satellite imagery I

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,430
think there's a fundamental point under

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,160
here around the value of the data and

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,140
how processing system like machine

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,990
learning allow that value to come out

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,670
and here's a second example this one a

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,410
Google product Street View which I

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,780
assume many of you are familiar with as

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,850
a feature of maps and that's really how

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,680
it started twelve years ago it was a

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,080
nice feature of maps it still is

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,740
I love the feature what has changed

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,650
since then

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,170
is that this corpus of images captured

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,510
over the last 12 years actually has a

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,140
lot more value than initially intended

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,370
why because we can now easily

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,830
efficiently extract additional

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,720
information you know what what store

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,730
what's what's being advertised what's in

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,769
the window you know and two years ago

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,320
you know was this the same store or some

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,120
other store this is really useful and

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,300
that's something that was not intended

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,560
what has changed is not the pictures you

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,390
know it's the same pictures you know I

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,370
assume slightly higher resolution now

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,140
than 10 years ago but that's not the

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,830
important part what really has changed

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,170
is the power of the processing and the

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,030
processing tools available and actually

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,400
the core of it you know be on machine

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,860
learning be on specific tools is the

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,230
fact that the value of the data is not

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,150
an intrinsic property of the data itself

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,580
the value of the data is really a

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,610
function it's a function of the data as

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,220
well as the power and ease of use and

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,170
cost and speed of the processing system

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,560
and that second part of the equation

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,959
that's really what has been changing you

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,000
know drastically you know over the last

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,859
well 20 years you know in the case of

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,140
Google going back to how we built it for

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,020
ourselves last ten years in the cloud

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,350
context of building an offering system

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,150
that not just offer

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,520
new and powerful capabilities like

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,530
tensorflow which we talked about like

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,050
Apache beam to unify batch and stream

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,000
and make stream very easy and but also

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,100
make them much easier and much more

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,260
effective by building server less

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,780
systems from the pond of ingestion

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,540
stream process seeing that our housing

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:49,050
machine learning and really or expanding

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,450
the range of possibilities which is why

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,980
now is the time to not just get familiar

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,960
with it and please come to the booths

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,900
we'll be happy to talk about it but then

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,790
based on that reconsider the value of

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,530
the dollar that you have or that you

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,050
could have and haven't been collected so

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,000
far and see in the context of this

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,450
available technology how much more you

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,389
can do with it thank you very much

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,389
[Applause]
