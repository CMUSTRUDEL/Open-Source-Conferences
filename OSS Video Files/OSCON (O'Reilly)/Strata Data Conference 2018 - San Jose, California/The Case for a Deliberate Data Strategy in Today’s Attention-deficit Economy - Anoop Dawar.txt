mapper is an elite sponsor of this event

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,040
and we want to thank you for choosing to

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,200
take the time to attend it I'm gonna

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,300
today talk about deliberate data

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,980
strategy in today's attention-deficit

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,960
economy in 1971 Hubbard

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,539
Alexander Simon coined a phrase that's

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,269
perhaps even more relevant today than it

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,820
was before it's called the attention

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,539
economy or as I like to call it the

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,989
attention deficit economy what he said

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,630
is that in an information-rich world the

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,469
abundance of information creates a

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,910
deficit or a poverty of something else

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,550
something that the information consumes

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,420
and the question is what does

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,629
information consume information consumes

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,750
our attention and we only have a finite

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,820
amount of attention to spare and those

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,690
organizations that are able to grab our

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,270
attention end up winning now you might

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,820
be wondering what does attention deficit

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,520
economy have to do with the Strada data

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,830
conference well I would like to submit

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,760
to you that we live in a data abundant

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,759
world in fact we perhaps have 10,000

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,580
times more data than there was in 1971

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,030
and it's growing and there is no science

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,220
of its stopping and that's a great thing

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,979
but it is creating a deficit it's

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,619
creating a problem and the problem is

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,840
what we have started to do is we take

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,290
all this data and we've started to

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,409
collect them in separate piles and these

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,960
piles or it looks like look like great

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,840
ways to get started but really quickly

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,200
start giving you very bad side effects

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,630
as map our engineers like to remind me

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,549
and our customers hey a noob it's not

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,530
the circles that are hard it's not these

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,200
technology tools that allow you to save

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,990
data that hard it's the lines that are

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,439
hard and what they mean by that is

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,320
what's happening in between these lines

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,039
creates a loss of information

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,129
misinformed decisions

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:14,020
and because we have only a limited

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:17,110
amount of attention we try to start so

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:22,030
following the simple the obvious and we

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:25,270
miss to solve what's more important and

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,520
it gets worse because now we are

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,290
creating another silo and another taller

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
and bigger silo for our machine learning

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,060
clusters which brings me to my favorite

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,830
topic artificial intelligence

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,740
two decades ago I was a graduate student

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:47,730
at the University of Texas at Austin NE

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:51,310
Austin guys in here UT go along hans and

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,410
i was a graduate student but i was also

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,300
teaching assistant for a graduate course

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:59,140
for artificial intelligence because I

00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,060
loved AI we tried all sorts of neural

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,570
networks and various other techniques

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,530
but truth be told I never made a major

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:11,410
breakthrough but today many of those

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,990
same algorithms when applied with big

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,620
data and big compute are coming back to

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,620
life in fact a lot of algorithms come

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,410
are coming up nowadays every week every

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,970
month there is a new algorithm and I

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,950
would like to say we have created one

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,830
more abundance at this point an

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:33,160
abundance of ML algorithms but we have

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,620
also then created a deficit a deficit of

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,830
data scientists obviously but also a

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,110
deficit of data logistics and data

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,870
logistics is essentially a process by

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,520
which you take all the data and you're

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,490
able to provide all of this data

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,980
regardless of which pilot is in do your

00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,800
data scientists and to your machine

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,850
learning algorithms in a secure and you

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,950
know organizationally efficient way now

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,170
I've had a privilege to talk to hundreds

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,120
of customers who have been able to deal

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,520
with this deficit and come out on the

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,290
other side with success and they've

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,600
shared their success stories with me and

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm hoping I shared the secrets with you

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,900
today and it really comes down to three

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:21,340
simple principles at the end of the day

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:23,890
one love the problem not the solution if

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,600
you if you sign up for what's happening

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,360
in big data or what's happening in the

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,599
tools

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,039
you will be amazed with the amount of

00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:34,340
information that you're gonna get and

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,710
you will again be be dealing with the

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,889
attention deficit so instead of focusing

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,199
on the tools focus on the problem and

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:45,770
the solute and the problem that you want

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,960
to solve second they've realized that

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,580
storing data in these separate piles is

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,939
causing more headache than it's worth it

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,330
so they're choosing a data fabric what

00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:58,759
is the data fabric a data fabric is a

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,330
place that can store all types of data

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:05,960
at vast scale a data fabric can store

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,689
data in motion and data at rest a data

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,629
fabric is not limited to a rack or a

00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:15,110
building but it can stretch from cloud

00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:17,449
to edge radically transforming how IT

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,580
infrastructures are built so that you

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,680
can leverage all these new tools like

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,520
cloud containers and IOT technologies

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,449
and third they interject intelligence

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,610
into operations so that you can take the

00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,949
insight and leverage it into your

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,500
operations before the insight perishes

00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:39,110
it's like an insight is an arbitrage and

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,699
if you can harness it you win if

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,259
somebody else harnesses it before you

00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:48,770
it's gone but to do that you have to be

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:51,319
able to unshackle the batch historical

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,729
way analytics has been done and instead

00:05:51,319 --> 00:06:01,960
replace it by modern mission-critical

00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:04,669
data flows and real-time applications

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,250
talking about real time applications I

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:10,279
would give you an example of world's

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,879
leading machine learning based lending

00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:17,180
platform for small and medium businesses

00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:19,849
this company is able to go from

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,250
application to approval within ten

00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:24,589
minutes and within 30 seconds can

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,009
deposit money into your account right

00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:30,589
after the approval that's amazing for a

00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,419
small and medium business law and they

00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,810
have today it processed over four

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,569
billion dollars of this now they do run

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,920
on a cloud they leverage the abundance

00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,960
of compute they level

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,840
the abundance of storage and all the

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,190
analytical tool kits but what they did

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,800
is they were able to interject

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,990
intelligence into operations and they

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,390
were able to have over four ninths of

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,100
high availability and three times the

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,860
speed of development for the new use

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,570
cases by choosing the data fabric

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,530
approach another but it's not just about

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08,600
a single cloud ROI and Sciences is a

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,580
global health care company and what they

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,280
do is they want to just radically

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,500
transform the drug discovery process so

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,020
they acquire molecules and data from

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,360
various organizations to speed up the

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,330
discovery by the nature of their

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,070
business all this data is spread across

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,010
multiple clouds and multiple locations

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,500
and they've built arguably the firls

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,440
industry's first drug discovery data

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,800
fabric that spans across all clouds and

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,160
on-premise locations and we talk about

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,680
clouds but we should not forget the edge

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,500
there is now growing consensus that not

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,010
all data of edge should or could be

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,410
moved to a central system you need to be

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,860
able to manage process analyze on on the

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,720
edge itself you need a system to learn

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,540
globally what's happening and each and

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,480
every edge location but then act locally

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:06,110
and precisely at every each and every

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:09,050
edge to press is a leading refinery in

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,900
Europe and Asia and what they've done is

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:15,040
they take 300 billion events a day all

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,110
in real-time to help control corrosion

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:22,880
online spelling and coke in furnace

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:24,470
tubes but what do all these three use

00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,350
cases that I shared with you have in

00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,170
common they were able to deal with the

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:34,400
deficit that comes with the abundance of

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,950
data and they did it by using a data

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,990
fabric that allows them to

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,870
simultaneously ingest manage store

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:46,550
process analyze and operate in real time

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:48,170
across all this data and it really boils

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,750
down to the same three principles I

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,150
talked about love the problem not the

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,550
solution

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,490
choose a fabric don't try to make too

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:01,570
many data piles and third interject

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,130
intelligence into your operations these

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,130
are just three of hundreds of examples

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:12,040
of customer success that you can have as

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,690
well finally I'll leave you with I would

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,280
like to invite you to the mapper boot to

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,240
learn about this and more customer

00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,010
success stories and let me end by saying

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,660
thank you for your lack of attention

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:30,010
deficit and may the fabric be with you

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,010
