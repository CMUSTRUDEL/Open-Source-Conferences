hey everyone it's great to be here at

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,810
strata I am since me and Pinterest did

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,960
this inspiring talk I thought I'd be

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,759
more grumpy and do a grumpy talk so so

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,020
we'll just kind of focus on grumpiness

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,930
here um and I wanted to start with kind

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,820
of taking a step back and you know take

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,609
what I say here with some grain of salt

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,340
right but you know up until 10 years or

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,380
so ago we if you work with data you

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,890
really really had two options that were

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,829
widely used you had screwdrivers and you

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,809
had hammers and since I used to work in

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,250
sequel server I was in the hammer

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,309
business and the hammer was the

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,980
relational database and the other thing

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,840
was the file system and this was if you

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,750
had data you put it in one of these two

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,910
you never put it in anything else at

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,469
least not in any kind of large use and

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,360
it's it it gets very interesting and

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,460
like why this happened

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,710
and what happens with it one of the

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,010
favorites I think examples for me when

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,950
we used to do you know talk to customers

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,479
and SharePoint was a common kind of

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,950
complaint hey I looked inside the

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,030
SharePoint database that you put in

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,640
sequel server why does it look like

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,909
no no it's not it's just you know

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,700
it's different and why is it different

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,030
well because we you know had to use a

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,650
hammer to cut down a tree right and why

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,729
did you use the hammer to cut down the

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,100
tree well it turns out if you're

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,810
building a system and you're running the

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,329
system yourself especially on your own

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,909
infrastructure and and if you like us

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,150
sell software we used to sell out

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,799
software then you worried about the

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,439
complexity of your system and you don't

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,090
want a gazillion stuff in there you just

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,890
won't okay I put the data here and make

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,130
sure this thing is alive I take backups

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,380
over here I can't use another right tool

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,030
for the job because then you know if

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,680
SharePoint used the right tool for the

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,500
job maybe you had to run you know ten

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,909
servers just to run some simple

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,459
collaboration thing okay and so then

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,060
what happened was the cloud came along

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,900
right and fueled by open source software

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,629
and all of the sudden we had

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,239
three key things we had reliable

00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:22,450
infrastructure so anyone can now say

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:26,560
that give me a VM and it runs and it

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,209
won't just disappear on you hey and all

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,560
of the sudden we had the democratized

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:35,709
extreme scale so if I had a problem in

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,780
the old days you had to focus on making

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,000
sure that the software could figure out

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,060
the problem fast enough for you you

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,040
couldn't rely simply on extreme computes

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,599
game all of the sudden in the cloud you

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,549
can and I you know using the term are

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,989
you loosely here of course there are you

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,670
know certain companies organizations

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,409
that have access to extreme scale and

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,569
had for a long long time but you know

00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:02,200
for most of us it just wasn't the case

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,840
and finally you start seeing services

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,329
rather than software right you don't

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,400
have to install and run the relational

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,379
database for your the no sequel thing or

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,540
the Big Data thing you can just rent it

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:16,150
as a service and now all of the sudden

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,609
you can use them the right tool for the

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,019
job and which creates a new problem and

00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:27,819
this is one of my favorite and of

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:29,620
pictures from this analyst 451

00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,230
researched they have this subway map

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,040
over the database world and you can see

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,799
they cover kind of no sequel relational

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,500
everything and if you look at this okay

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,840
now now I there's there's some some some

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,120
to choose from here and you get into

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,549
these kind of dangerous conversations

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,159
also with you know across big data no

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,900
sequel and relational with statements

00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,049
like you can't use a relational database

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,989
for a foo right or you can't use Hadoop

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:02,409
or spark for this thing or you can't use

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:04,479
no sequel for this thing which is you

00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:07,180
know rarely the case right because no

00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:10,389
relational database is exactly the same

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,280
as another relational database so you

00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:14,340
have to have a much more nuanced

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,199
conversation right you have so well okay

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,699
can so-and-so tool help me with this and

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,979
whether or not it's a no sequel tool or

00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:26,349
a relational tool may actually be less

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,620
important so we have to go and all of

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,389
the sudden spend more time

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,010
standing what exactly can the tool do

00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:35,030
because you used to have very few

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:37,389
options right so how do you pick the

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,720
right tool and there is basically two

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:44,780
you know simplify two paths there one is

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,780
and this is very common dogmatic

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,760
standardization you know I'm gonna put

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,620
the chair here I'm gonna put a point my

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,580
holes that way I'm just going to go do

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,050
that and and if you do this some of the

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,060
times you're gonna put out the fire and

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,699
it's gonna be great but some of the

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,280
times it's not gonna work very well but

00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,960
this is a reaction to I have so much

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,419
choice I'm just gonna simplify it we're

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,479
just gonna put everything in hdfs be

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,400
everything I don't doesn't matter that

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,550
everything goes there or everything goes

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,580
in sequel server like and neither choice

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,740
is obviously good and here it's super

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,410
important for us to always strive to

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,930
take a principled approach instead okay

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:30,080
so what is the actual problem that I

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,180
need to solve here what is it that we

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,479
actually need to accomplish and what are

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,180
the actual priorities and given this

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,400
plethora of choice it gets more and more

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,460
complex so it gets more and more

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,710
important to actually spend the time to

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,380
pick the right tool for the job and to

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,060
balance like probably I can't have you

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,650
know use all of the tools I don't have

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,289
familiarity with all of the tools I

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,180
don't have expertise and but I also

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,190
can't just restrict myself because I'm

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,800
gonna have absolutely best people that

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,080
know this and only know this and they're

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,430
super expert in that you likely not

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:10,070
gonna produce great results with this so

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:13,070
from your perspective of requirements I

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,349
I kind of like this as as a starting

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,930
point around value so there is some sort

00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:20,630
of value spectrum for your data okay and

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,419
it goes across obviously high value and

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,449
the other side of the spectrum is is

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:29,240
unknown value because I don't really

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,639
know if it's valuable or not yet which

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,070
is obviously where we see the explosion

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,130
of data today is on the unknown value

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,320
section and it's a good example for us

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,520
for example we run the actual data

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,180
services

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,490
and so we get a ton of telemetry right

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,990
that what is happening in the service

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:53,389
and a lot of this telemetry is is

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,819
unknown value to us I don't know what to

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:59,509
do with it but maybe in the future it

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:03,229
becomes important and some of the data

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:05,120
is highly valuable and simple definition

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,099
of valuable and not valuable or unknown

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,639
unknown value is basically actionability

00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:13,009
so unknown value is basically not

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:16,130
actionable and high value is highly

00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:18,139
actionable so someone puts an order into

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,060
a system it's very actionable I need to

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:24,080
just procure that thing deliver it to

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,169
customer procure payments right vs.

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,300
so-and-so device emitted a ton of stuff

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,580
that we put over here not sure what to

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,860
do with it and you have to have an

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,310
answer so for example under requirements

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,470
I'd unknown value you will be very

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,310
focused on cost because you probably

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,990
need to store a lot and on the high

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,810
value side you may have much more

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,849
requirements around latency I need to be

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,969
able to send some ad hoc query in and I

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:55,099
need a response within milliseconds

00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:57,560
microseconds whatever it may be so I

00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:01,039
like to say unknown value data is store

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,620
a lot use a little okay and high-value

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,289
data is store a little use a lot okay

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,969
and this is it sounds like an

00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,550
oversimplification but it is actually a

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:12,860
very useful starting point and then

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,020
treat each thing as a separate spectrum

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:19,520
to figure out what are the actual

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,990
requirements that you have so in terms

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,030
of what to do here it's it's fairly

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,030
simple so start with your requirements

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,900
and and really prioritize prioritization

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,759
is where I see most customers get into

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,669
trouble because you prioritize things

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,729
incorrectly you have to focus on what is

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,349
really important for the business here

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,659
what is really high value data what is

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,149
really unknown value what is what does

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,730
the value imply so start with your

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:49,579
requirements and then don't forget to

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,100
try it sounds also like this stupid

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:53,839
recommend ever of course but many people

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,290
actually don't try enough or someone

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,149
else

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:02,750
try this it failed what they do wrong

00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:05,089
right so go and actually try and it's

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,329
not that hard like try the most

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:10,160
important things just simple simple POC

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:13,610
okay this make sense let's go forward

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,940
and then very dangerous don't get too

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,800
attached to standardization so

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,600
standardization is obviously good we

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,980
know these are the ten tools or five

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,720
tools whatever it is that we've decided

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,230
to use we have expertise we know how to

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,180
manage we know how to use them but don't

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,490
fall into the trap of getting dogmatic

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,190
there which is a very very common thing

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,069
you'll see over and over again and we

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,029
have to stand up against this and say no

00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:42,050
let's take a step back and let's

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:43,819
understand the problem so let's let's go

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,040
forward you know embrace the choice

00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:48,040
let's not go backwards thank you

00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,829
