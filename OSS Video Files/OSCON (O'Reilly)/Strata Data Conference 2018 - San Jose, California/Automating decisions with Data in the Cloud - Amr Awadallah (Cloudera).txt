	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
that talk from Eric was very relevant

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,040
actually to my talk my talk is very

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,120
similar about journalists versus

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,950
custom-built purpose-built systems about

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,590
two years ago I was up on stage here

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:22,289
where I made the analogy that legacy

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:24,000
data systems are like the camera meaning

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,740
the single purpose they only do one

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,750
thing with our data for example in the

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,160
case of databases they only do sequel

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,019
they do sequel very well what's the only

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,450
thing they do in the case of search

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,940
engines they only do search but it's the

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,649
only thing they do and then I meant

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,059
analogy that what we're trying to a

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,700
cloud era and many of us in this new

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,800
generation of big data is similar to the

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,450
smartphone of big data meaning

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,640
multi-purpose systems creating systems

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,520
that can do many many things not just

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,680
one thing so generous versus single

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,469
purpose customized which is exactly the

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,899
stock that Eric just proceeded with and

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,370
the problem with single purpose systems

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,649
is what you can see in the slide popping

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,030
up right now is if we have single

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,290
purpose systems then every time we want

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,850
to do something new we want to do data

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,710
exploration we want to do search we

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,900
don't do machine learning the pro

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,420
match data processing analytics every

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,150
time we have to copy our data and

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,720
reformat our data see realized in a new

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,090
way

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,460
have a new schema depending on the task

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,430
at hand and that creates a massive

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,580
sprawl inside of our organization that

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,409
makes it very hard to be agile and they

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,299
hard to be able to adapt at very high

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,380
speed which is exactly the point of

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,909
ethics talk just preceding this talk so

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,770
how do we solve that problem at Cloudera

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,110
well the way that we solve this problem

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,439
is by creating the smart phone of Big

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,540
Data

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,340
our marketing team did not like the term

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,460
smartphone of Big Data which I have been

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,110
advocating for and they instead came up

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,640
with that with a very nice name actually

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,369
do like the name we came up with at the

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,380
end and the name we came up with at the

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,170
end is called SDX shared data experience

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,329
and this is what SDX does SDX allows us

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,909
to take this vertical isolation and turn

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,819
it into a horizontal generalist platform

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,310
so this way can have multi functions

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,270
like the science machine learning

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,150
analytics etc etc and

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,150
have the SDX layer in between to bridge

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,060
that gap and allow you to have a common

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,210
security governance metadata management

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,950
access control foundation that then can

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,780
connect you to many many underlying

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,390
physical storage so you can have the

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,140
virtual view that is consistent across

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,090
all of these different workloads and

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,550
this is actually one of the key powers

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,950
of our platform it's what enables you to

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,930
be agile and try a new use cases it was

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,540
enabling you to both have exploration

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,730
but also have production at the same

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,350
time significantly shorting the time

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,270
between coming up with a new idea to

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,520
when it can make a big impact on the

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,840
business and as the ex has been part of

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,150
the cloud era for a very very long time

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,790
despite us announcing that in the name

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,790
very recently last year we have been

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,490
doing and preaching the concept of SDX

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,740
for a very long time so what is new at

00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,620
this conference is we are taking the

00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,300
concept of SDX into the cloud and in the

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,670
cloud the problem is much worse so in

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,709
the cloud because of these temporary

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:22,209
clusters are coming up and down all the

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:24,910
time you get a significant amplification

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,980
in the sprawl of silos actually and many

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,450
of them come up do some operations and

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,950
they disappear and the metadata

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,990
disappears with them so the problem is

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,540
actually much worse in the cloud than it

00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,280
is compared to on-premise so we are

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,820
announcing the launch of SDX

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,130
beta platform as a service option that

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,180
keeps track of all of that metadata and

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:49,840
access control in the cloud and not only

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:53,459
does it do that it also allows us to

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,990
keep track of that metadata across many

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,209
instance situations across many cloud

00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:01,209
environments so you can have some

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:04,120
clusters in Amazon AWS you can have some

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,970
customers in Microsoft Azure or even

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,940
on-premise and get a single view of how

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,650
the metadata the access control the

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,840
governance the whole thing is being

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,910
changed and affected in all of these

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,040
environments so not only that that

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,620
reduce the sprawl problem that we

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,720
mentioned to earlier it also makes the

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,550
portability much easier between all

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,500
these environments the same code the

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,980
same logic that you did on premise can

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,440
carry too

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,830
any of these environments and that's the

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,019
key message of my presentation

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,019
