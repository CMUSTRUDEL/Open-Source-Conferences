	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,309
good morning my name is Nikita Shamanov

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,670
I'm the CEO co-founder of M sequel and

00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:14,309
today I want to talk to you about time

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:17,550
why it matters what's happening in the

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:21,630
world and how you can take advantage of

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,920
time as human beings we are our own

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,800
real-time systems life work and fun all

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,260
depends on time we just saw it in the

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,320
Olympics how just a split second can

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,860
make a difference of making and winning

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,350
the medal and in the financial markets

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:45,180
the old adage rings true time is money

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,329
all new applications and even entire

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,379
industries are predicated on the ability

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,649
to adapt and learn in real time so we

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,250
all know time matters and to building

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:02,219
the right hands time can make a

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,870
difference in saving lives so last year

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,229
we shared our work with a nonprofit

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,590
called thorn to help identify and save

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,560
missing children using real-time image

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,659
recognition and this year I'm happy to

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,090
announce another partnership with one of

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,520
the largest hospitals in the Bay Area

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,909
with them we're pushing the boundaries

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,170
of prostate cancer research well

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,909
specifically we accelerate data

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,810
processing that's what data people do

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,650
but we allow them to process more DNA

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,520
sequences identify more matches and

00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,040
fundamentally provide better

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,720
preventative care which is a great cause

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,840
as one in seven men according to

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,950
American Cancer Society will be

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,380
diagnosed with prostate cancer so across

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,299
this and many many other use cases the

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,060
winning combination is not just the

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,180
speed it's the comprehensiveness of the

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,880
platform the ability to store granular

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,600
data in the system and all that data and

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,369
provide high fidelity of that data so

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,629
that's why that's why today I'm very

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,360
excited to announce an industry

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,740
groundbreaking benchmark of achieving

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,100
the processing power of

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:24,300
one trillion rose per second so the data

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,010
is run on 12 Intel servers it's a

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,140
combination of technology advancements

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,810
of scale out architecture operations on

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,530
encoded data and the latest hardware

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,190
advancements from Intel which is

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:41,340
advanced vector processing the data is

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,380
about 115 billion rows of simulated

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,760
Nasdaq trades it's compressed and stored

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,870
in MEMS equal using columnstore

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,510
compression and the hardware is just 12

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:55,590
Intel servers each with two skylake

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,510
processors and we also use some Numa or

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,510
non-uniform memory access optimizations

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,340
to run that benchmark the actual query

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,520
computes top ten most traded stocks and

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,560
as you can see on the right we process

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,320
that query touching every single row in

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,600
the data set in just a tenth of a second

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,500
which brings us to one point one

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,720
trillion rows per second so trillion is

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,790
a very large number we talked about

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,610
trillions when we talk about our GDP or

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,900
we talk the number of galaxies in the

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:30,480
universe but the the most amazing fact

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,640
about about that processing speed is you

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,770
can achieve this with just 12 servers

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,960
you can buy those 12 servers with your

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,540
favorite server vendor or you can

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:45,090
instantly rent those servers right now

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:47,400
on your favorite cloud provider so it's

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,830
fun to talk about about benchmarks it's

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,510
fun as it's like systems engineers to

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:57,380
squeeze the most out of modern hardware

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:59,730
but big numbers mean big savings and

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,410
with big numbers you can have the

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:06,090
ability to do more with less please stop

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,720
by our booth at 11 a.m. and we'll

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,700
demonstrate this this live so this

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,420
brings us to the vision of a latency

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,560
free life we see latency free achieved

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,080
with the convergence of transactional

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,169
and analytical workloads that allows us

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,250
to take some of the very complex systems

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,470
and

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,930
converge them and unify them and

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:36,340
simplify your architecture fundamentally

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,650
driving your return on investments so

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,940
our customers achieve latency free life

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:45,130
today by incorporating operational data

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,220
to power real-time applications and

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,950
running analytics in the same system if

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,380
you were to pick an operational latency

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,810
free systems these are the requirements

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,290
that we advise you to do the system has

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,880
to be scale out operational and easily

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,800
compatible with the rest of your

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,920
ecosystem if you want to see a great

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,730
example of latency free life in in real

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,520
life please stop by our guests

00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,590
disney-abc as they will be presenting

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,120
how they achieve that latency free life

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:21,370
today so our journey to latency free

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,960
life is ongoing and the technology is

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,960
available for you today thank you

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,810
