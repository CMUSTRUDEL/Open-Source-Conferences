	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,430
so today I would talk about how we

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,560
constantly combine the human data and a

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,210
machine learning to address three areas

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,460
issues first is understand our pinners

00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,020
second understand the pings and the last

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,939
one is really making a connection

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,619
between pinners to our pains so the

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,720
first area we could talk about is

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,090
understand the pinners they are our

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,519
users we understand them at the

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:35,190
individual level and also at the group

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:38,040
level for example we learned that

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,760
pinners and United Kingdom's love

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,719
avocado as much as the pinners in United

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,850
States but not so much of a crock-pot

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,730
painters and friends love to talk about

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,180
home decoration ideas why the painters

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,690
at Germany they talk about sustainable

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,510
living all the time and we also noticed

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,390
from the micro trend level souping is

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,920
the new juicing because the search of

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,960
the souping showed up 300% we also

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,119
realized that mix tomato

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,729
may be a new training home decoration

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,700
because again many many traffic goes

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,130
through the board about mix tomato as

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,680
you can tell those are invertible inside

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,939
our partner can use because they can

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,540
predict where the users going next about

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,000
pings

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,880
as a visual discovery engine it is

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,060
critical for us to understand what's in

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,960
the image but a pin is not just an image

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,689
it is a visual bookmark to a creative

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,759
idea understand what's in it

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,930
understand what's the style behind it is

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,710
a very challenging problem for us take a

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,770
look at this living room scene how would

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,280
you describe a style it's simple it's

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,820
cozy

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,860
maybe a little bit contemporary how many

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,530
times you work into a furniture store

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,270
and the salesperson will ask you what's

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,090
your style what are you looking for I

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,849
don't know about you but I always have a

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,650
hard time to describe my style and lack

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,769
of a vertebrae to precisely

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,549
describe that but I knew it when I see

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:23,040
it that's why in Pinterest we use

00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:25,500
computer vision technology to break down

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,379
the image and understand the object

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,920
within the image and also recommend the

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:35,069
similar things for you to consider in

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,010
fact we go one step further for every

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,709
object we detect we connected data and

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,079
process data from retailer partners so

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,900
that we know the price and inventory of

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:48,980
those object when our penis ready to

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,459
make a purchase we are here to help

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,540
now before we launch things like that

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,889
everyone work on machine learning know

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,780
how important the data is so on top of

00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:03,269
intensive interaction data we have from

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,239
the users we also have a group of

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:10,019
specialists working with our engineer to

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,939
clean up evaluate and label the data so

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,329
our computer vision engineer have the

00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,970
best data to work with in fact every

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:21,120
night we'll launch a new computer vision

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,930
model and this partnership between human

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,720
data and a machine learning pays off

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:30,209
currently we are serving more than 600

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:36,540
million visual searches every month and

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:40,139
this number is growing last but not the

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,510
least connected pinners with panes it is

00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,370
easy to think about once you understand

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,769
the pinners and then that panes

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,849
it should be simple to connect them both

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:52,919
right not necessarily because let me

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:55,680
show you all the pins we have to serve

00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,959
again with a hundred billion pins in the

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,769
database it is impossible to rank them

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,229
all for every user real time that's why

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,180
we have internally a graph based or

00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,760
recommendation engine that will future

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,760
the candidate for us to rank for every

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,739
user pin ability is an internal term

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,769
represent a group of machine learning

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,409
models to predict the engagement level

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:23,419
of a pin or towards a pin or relevance

00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:23,419
