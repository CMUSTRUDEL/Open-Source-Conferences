	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,390
we launched very quietly in August of

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,490
2013 we pulled 4,000 mobile numbers from

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,349
the dosomething database in Chicago and

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,639
then in El Paso we wanted to see the

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,320
difference between the markets and we

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,179
just messaged out to them that there's

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,410
this new hotline available if someone

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,010
they knew needed it which meant they had

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,010
to reoptimize

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:31,349
entirely word-of-mouth I can't believe

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:32,850
you're not clapping okay I mean on one

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,950
hand it's great on the other hand it's

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,260
really sad there's a lot of pain in

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,329
America and in particular young people

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,270
needed a place to turn to it turns out

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,219
that text is a fantastic way to crisis

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,890
council people it's private

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,750
no one overhears you so during lunch

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,760
time we experience high volume every day

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,530
and you think that she's texting the boy

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,329
across the Taffet area or her mom and

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,309
she's actually texting us about the

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,149
anxiety she's feeling and she's on the

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,100
verge of having a panic attack we get

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,700
people from the back of biology class we

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,470
get adults in meetings feeling anxiety

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,869
or depression about their performance at

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,640
work in the heat of the moment because

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,890
it's private which means we have the

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,560
maximum ability to tip someone to a

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,180
healthy direction if you text us in that

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,780
moment when you're about to swallow a

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,939
pill be respond in anger or take some

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,830
kind of anger some kind of response that

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,140
might have a permanent impact on your

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,909
life or others and instead you text us

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,729
and we can remind you how strong you are

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,369
and that there are other options we can

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,549
have the maximum possible impact it

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,759
turns out our textures skew young poor

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,130
and rural 75% of our users are under the

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
tail age of 25 including and I say this

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,920
as a parent including 10 percent of our

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,390
users under the age of 13 which is

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,810
really large when you think about who

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,540
has a cellphone poor if you take the

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,590
nation's lowest 10% by socioeconomic

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,600
status area codes that 10% is using 19%

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,420
of our volume so we double over index

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,910
the poorest people in America and rural

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,709
rural area codes rural locations where

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,319
they don't have access to mental health

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,450
and behavioral health services I mean

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,939
including five percent of our textures

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,889
indicate that they are Native American

00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,150
or Native Alaskan which is interesting

00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:25,879
considering that only one and a half

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,879
