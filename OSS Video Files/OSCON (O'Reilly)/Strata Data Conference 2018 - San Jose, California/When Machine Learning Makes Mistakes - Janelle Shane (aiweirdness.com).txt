	00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,330
so here's a one of the experiments I did

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,580
recently for my blog I gave a recurrent

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,010
neural network character level recurrent

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,320
neural network a list of paint colors

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,450
about 7000 colors from Sherwin Williams

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,109
and I asked it to generate some more

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,890
like vac and these ones are kind of like

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:26,369
that but I don't think turd Lee is going

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,800
to be the 2019 color of the year and so

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,390
uh you know it's actually tough to get

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,099
rid of a problem like this you can come

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,290
up with an old list and you can say okay

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,180
you may not use any words on this list

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,010
please and you can be as creative as you

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,260
want trying to think of all the words it

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,420
might possibly generate and then you

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,309
still end up you cannot imagine all the

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,140
different ways in which an algorithm is

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,170
going to get around you and do something

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,719
unexpected and so this is you know this

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,550
is an algorithm that has match has

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,559
managed to match the surface appearance

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,750
of a paint color but it is kind of

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,609
missing the deeper point about what

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,579
words mean in which words you should use

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,070
and here's another example I trained as

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,130
an another neural network to generate

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,170
cookbook recipes so I gave it 100

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,060
megabytes the cookbook recipes said ok

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,159
generate more and it managed to

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,810
ingredients list and directions and all

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,360
that but if you start reading the

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,299
directions you get the idea that perhaps

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,820
this algorithm doesn't even understand

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,810
what water is or that these directions

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,090
are doing something to ingredients and

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,790
so here's an another example this time

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,430
image recognition so this is as yours

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,740
API I put in one of my vacation photos

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,390
and this is a really impressive job

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,670
actually not only did it see the sheep

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,829
but also knew exactly which hills on the

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,860
Isle of Skye I was standing on at the

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,030
time but something interesting happens

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,950
if you look at the picture on the right

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,079
I have photoshopped out every single

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,820
sheep from this picture and yet they're

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,490
still there in the caption and in the

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,860
tags so what's going on here I mean is

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,170
this a homeopathic sheep does it somehow

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,780
maintain the memory of sheep that used

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,130
to be there the answer is more simple

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,750
than that it whatever it sees a

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,100
landscape of this type this particular

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,610
algorithm will hallucinate sheep and

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,410
you know so here's another couple of

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,970
examples we've got on the Left we've got

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:22,280
a draft loosen Aidid as well over on the

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,950
right we've got sheep again but we've

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,450
also got a rainbow and so this gives you

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,000
a clue that this particular algorithm

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,460
has maybe not quite understood what

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,900
sheep are it does not have an abstract

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,910
concept of sheep thinks it's maybe a

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,680
quality of the landscape and there's

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,680
maybe doing the same thing with rainbows

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,230
