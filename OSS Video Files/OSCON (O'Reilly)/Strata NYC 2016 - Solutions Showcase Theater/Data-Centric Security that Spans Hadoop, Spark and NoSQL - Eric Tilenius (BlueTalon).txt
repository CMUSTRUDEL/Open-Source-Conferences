	                              alright everyone welcome to the blue                               talon presentation at the startup                               showcase at strata and hadoop world my                               name is Eric to Linnaeus i'm the CEO                               blue talon and wanted to talk to you                               this afternoon about data centric                               security why it's important how you can                               apply it let's start with talking a                               little bit about data centric security                                what what we do at blue talon is give                                you the tools to control data at the                                data level this is extremely important                                in light of all the data breaches you're                                reading about in the news seemingly                                every week but also for any business                                that has any sort of regulatory                                compliance requirement or even just                                looking at best practices in terms of                                securing customer data and nowadays                                geographically there are lots of                                different requirements that need to be                                met so what we do is provide two very                                important functions at the data level                                the first is visibility being able to                                add a really clear view of what's                                happening with your data who's accessing                                it when why how much the second is                                controlling it with very precise                                fine-grained controls that let's you be                                extremely surgical about who gets what                                data this is important because data is                                the lifeblood of business today you                                can't just lock data away from users but                                too much data is consistent with                                business way too much data drives up                                business risk so what you want to do is                                get all the value from the data but keep                                the risk and you know oftentimes you                                think of data is already security as it                                is a different function right as the                                security guys they've worried about my                                endpoint or my perimeter but as a group                                of folks working with the database this                                is actually the most important part of                                the data breach security equation a                                famous bank robber Willie Sutton was                                once asked why do you rob banks and his                                answer was that's where the money is and                                if you're looking at people who are                                after sensitive data the database is the                                bank that's where the sensitive data is                                that's where they're going to hit in                                fact in the anthem breach we're just a                                handful of compromised accounts were                                used to exfiltrate                                                   what happened was they deliberately                                targeted people who might have database                                access got their credentials and then                                exfiltrated all that data and in fact                                only one account is needed JPMorgan                                Chase head                                at a breach where one account was used                                to take                                                            Office of Personnel Management breached                                the same thing so what's happening is                                there's very poor control at the data                                level and in fact in a pony mon                                institute survey                                                        said they had access to data they                                shouldn't volunteered that so this is                                something that we need to do a lot about                                now the existing solutions and the                                traditional way of doing this is to put                                in controls either at the app level or                                on a specific database level so you'd                                code in custom views in one database or                                use a vendor-supplied technology to do                                it and the problem with this in a big                                data world is that you're now using so                                many different databases that when you                                do that you have inconsistent controls                                no visibility no auditing it also makes                                sure your database infrastructure very                                brittle so if you've got your security                                hard-coded in database a and you now                                want to use database be you can't                                because you have to then redo all that                                security logic what blue Talon does to                                solve this problem is give you those                                twin capabilities of control and                                visibility in a layer that lets you                                apply it across all your different data                                stores so will work across Hadoop will                                work across new sequel will work with                                spark will work with sequel will work on                                Prem will work in the cloud giving you                                consistent control and consistent                                visibility of the data across all your                                different heterogeneous data stores and                                 giving you flexibility and ease in terms                                 of those data policies one of our                                 customers estimated that they're going                                 to save two to four million dollars next                                 year because it's so much easier to                                 manage the policies this way from a                                 control standpoint what we do is give                                 you unrivaled tools to give you that                                 very precise control you can go down to                                 a file a folder a table a field a                                 subfield row a column a partial file you                                 can protect at the hive level at the                                 HDFS level we let you do that with any                                 role so if someone's in Active Directory                                 or LDAP you can provision based on that                                 use data rules based on their role but                                 also on any attribute so depending on                                 the time of day their location etc you                                 can also put in place different data                                 rules                                 the controls are all dynamic this is all                                 real time we don't copy or duplicate the                                 data and it's all done the way that                                 works transparently with every                                 application so here's an example where                                 for a certain group you might want to                                 say hey look deny the ability to read                                 credit cards ever for socials maybe                                 they're in customer service let them see                                 the last four mask everything else and                                 if they're in the western region office                                 they don't need to see all the world's                                 records or all the country's records                                 just show western regions it's greater                                 than                                                                rules in place with blue talon any                                 attempt to get at the database so for                                 example in sequel or high parlance if                                 you're looking at select star from                                 accounts they're only going to see                                 western region accounts they're never                                 going to see credit card numbers and                                 social security numbers will be                                 automatically masked so you only see the                                 last four i mentioned control but                                 there's also visibility this is                                 increasingly important to be really                                 aware of who's accessing what data how                                 much data are they accessing what rules                                 and policies are they hitting this is                                 not only useful for forensics if there's                                 an incident that happens it's frankly                                 really useful for detecting unusual                                 activity patterns it could be the signs                                 and early signs of a data breach                                 oftentimes data breaches go on for weeks                                 and months before they're ever detected                                 and with our system you could look at                                 what data activity looks like compared                                 to historical patterns normal usage                                 patterns etc the reason we're able to do                                 this effectively is that we have an                                 architecture that lets you put all the                                 policies in the policy engine lets you                                 audit and monitor with the audit engine                                 and consistently enforce with an                                 enforcement point that's mated to each                                 unique data store we support enforcement                                 points on every major Hadoop                                 distribution both at the hive an Apollo                                 level as well as at the HDFS level for                                 spark for Cassandra for most of your                                 common relational databases and both on                                 Prem as well in the cloud and virtual                                 private cloud what that means is you can                                 write policies once and deploy them                                 multiple places and have seamless                                 security and seamless monitoring across                                 a variety of different data stores now                                 typically when we we share this                                 information the first question will get                                 is that sounds amazing but what about                                 performance and we work very very hard                                 to                                 or lightning fast performance there's a                                 number of optimizations we do in the net                                 of it is that typically it's about                                    overhead so you can get all the                                 monitoring and all the security with no                                 impact to users so key takeaways are one                                 you want to architect your security to                                 match the infrastructure the                                 infrastructures changing the                                 infrastructures heterogeneous make sure                                 you have security policies that can work                                 effectively they're the one of the ways                                 you do that is by bringing security to                                 its own layer don't think about hard                                 coding security in particular data                                 stores think about treating security as                                 its own layer in the stack that's what                                 we do you want to deploy controls that                                 are data aware that will treat different                                 groups different roles as well as                                 different data types differently because                                 it's not a one-size-fits-all and finally                                 a little bit of a self-serving plug but                                 you know pick a partner that works and                                 and is validated with the leading                                 companies
