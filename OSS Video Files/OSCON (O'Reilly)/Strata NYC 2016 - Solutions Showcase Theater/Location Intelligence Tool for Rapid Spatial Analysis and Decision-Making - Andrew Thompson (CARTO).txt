	                              hello everyone my name is Andrew                               Thompson I'm a solutions engineer at                               cart                                                                startup so we do make software to do                               spatial analytics and and mapping on all                               kinds of the location data that that                               your business might have your store                               locations where your customers are                               coming from how much they're spending                                where all sorts of things like that and                                so we make a software as a service                                platform called the carto builder that                                allows you to create upload data and                                create insightful geospatial dashboards                                for slicing and dicing and filtering                                that data provide a processing different                                analyses on top of it other things like                                that so when you first log in I have                                just a basic view of all my maps and                                dashboards and the data sets that I've                                uploaded I have in this case by my                                thompson account we support multi user                                accounts so you can share dashboards and                                share data sets back and forth i can go                                ahead and upload a new dataset we                                support a variety of different file                                formats a lot of geographic file formats                                but even something as simple as the CSV                                connections to google drive dropbox                                arcgis server ESRI is an important                                player on industry and we are compatible                                with em too so once you upload your data                                into car too it's fully searchable and                                you can go around and look for that in                                that case I have a data set under for                                Portland customers that I can go ahead                                and bring up there and it's just a you                                get an immediate tabular view we're                                based off internally off of postgresql                                so you can open this equal pain and run                                arbitrary sequel queries to filter down                                your data set and find the set that you                                that you need you can get a quick map                                preview of all those records or                                locations in a map and if you're                                satisfied then go ahead and create the                                map and we'll go through and now you're                                in our builder user interface so we have                                a nice sidebar here where I can select                                different types of base maps we have a                                light and a dark style as well as more                                standard styles for kind of                                highlighting interstate highways or even                                something like satellite imagery in this                                case for the presentation i'll go ahead                                and use one of our lighter styles there                                and then i can go into my data set and i                                do some analysis here so we can we can                                style it Carter graphically I've arrived                                different options in this case we can do                                aggregation by different cells to get a                                quick count of my customers or if I                                wanted to get a sum of what the total                                value is I could do hexagons as well we                                can even do animations over time and I                                could select a particular such as my                                publish date to see when customers have                                come in and I get a real time I date                                histogram there that I can filter down                                to a specific portion and see that live                                on the map and then clear that selection                                for now I'll just go back to that                                standard point styling I can do x value                                coloration so if I wanted to take a look                                at my points based on how much my                                customers have been spending I can go up                                and select a couple of different                                quantification buckets we're talking                                about money here so maybe I pick a green                                color ramp switch that style I can these                                dots are a little small on the screen so                                I'll make that a little bit bigger and I                                can quickly see you know kind of what                                the relative value of each customer                                location is there if I wanted to                                actually go through and do some analysis                                on this data so maybe I'm thinking of                                opening new stores in portland and i                                want to figure out the most optimal way                                to do that i have about budget for                                   stores or six and i could go ahead and                                do an analysis that'll create clusters                                of all these points that i have here so                                i can go ahead and add that analysis and                                I'm presented with just a simple wizard                                here is using k-means clustering here so                                i can specify the number of clusters                                that I'd like to see and then hit apply                                there and it'll take a second and this                                 is actually added a new column to my                                 data set telling me for all my customer                                 points which cluster they belong to and                                 so I can go ahead and                                 and style that now I have a categorical                                 value right there in that cluster number                                 so I could change my quantification to a                                 category style and see really quickly                                 with divergent colors there where where                                 these clusters and points are and we're                                 kind of my customers equally spaced out                                 into six different clusters there but                                 say you know I want to locate my store                                 my sales rep in the center of each of                                 those clusters to make sure i have                                 maximum impact I can chain multiple                                 analyses together so now that I've                                 created these clusters I want to add a                                 new analysis to find the centroid of all                                 of those of each of those clusters and                                 so i can add that analysis i'm going to                                 want to categorize that by the cluster                                 number so i want to find the centroid of                                 all my customers in portland but                                 specifically those clusters i created in                                 the last analysis i can go ahead and run                                 that hit apply and then it adds a new                                 category for any and a value for each of                                 those cluster points in this case starts                                 off a little small we'll make that a                                 little bit bigger for the screen so                                 that's six clusters but I got rid so now                                 I know where I should cite my sales reps                                 or my stores but I lost all my customers                                 here because we did that aggregation                                 step so I can go back into my lair list                                 and I can actually drag out one of these                                 analyses here as a new layer go ahead                                 and done there whoop and here I'll just                                 give it a quick refresh there                                 make sure that show is that nope well I                                 we're an early Developer Preview phase                                 here so i have another version of that                                 map that i made it ahead of time just in                                 case i ran into any bugs here so here                                 you see what is intending to do we have                                 that clusters appliance is a layer below                                 there and I've dragged that out into new                                 layer and added that that centroid                                 analysis there and that's what those                                 black points are we can actually see                                 those centroids and another element that                                 when in showcase to use is is these                                 widgets on the side here these filters                                 that we have so i can go ahead and go in                                 and on any column of my data and a                                 variety of different kinds of widgets i                                 can get a quick histogram of a numerical                                 column or you know a formula that might                                 count the the value and so if i wanted                                 to get the average customer value in say                                 a particular cluster then i have this                                 category widget so i'll go ahead and                                 select cluster for and then see that                                 average recalculate itself there based                                 on the points that are on my map if i                                 wanted to zoom in in a particular area                                 and see that value increase there so i                                 can i can filter and and and slice and                                 dice that that data there and actually                                 find an insight like right now it's                                 telling me most of my customers are in                                 cluster                                                            downtown Portland there and so I can go                                 ahead and click that and see the                                 histogram update and see that actually                                 those customers and cluster                                             predominantly towards the lower end of                                 the value spectrum so this may be quick                                 visits to my in a convenience store                                 picking up simple cup of coffee or                                 something like that but actually if I go                                 ahead and select cluster for those                                 customers tend towards the higher end of                                 the value spectrum so those are maybe                                 bigger purchases or things like that so                                 that's a business insight that I might                                 want to see you know stock that store                                 with more expensive inventory or premium                                 products or things like that and then I                                 can use that histogram for filtering as                                 well so if I wanted to quickly see you                                 know where my low value customers were                                 or my high-value customers like that and                                 be able to do that there I'm a little                                 bit of a time left so I was showing an                                 example of another map that that we made                                 this is in this case this is of railroad                                 accidents and it comes in as just a                                 simple point map of all the locations in                                 the country in the past four years that                                 there's been a railroad accident or                                 derailment or things like that we have a                                 styling option that lets me aggregate                                 that by States or provinces and I can go                                 ahead and do a quick x value styling in                                 this case of the counts of the accidents                                 within those locations or maybe you know                                 I want to do a sum of the total damage                                 and dollar values per state and so if I                                 want to go ahead and select a different                                 type of accidents so say I'm interested                                 in particular in highway rail crossings                                 so I could click that and I see my my                                 history and widget on the train speed at                                 the point that it had the accident                                 actually increases so overall you say                                 that most trains countrywide tend to                                 have accidents when they're traveling at                                 a fairly low speed but highway rail                                 crossings are different in particular                                 often the trains moving fast it can't                                 stop in time there's a car stuck on the                                 track and that histogram changes there                                 and you see that those accidents tend to                                 happen at a much higher speed and you do                                 it the other way to say I'm only                                 interested in my high speed accidents                                 and I can see that category widget                                 update on the fly there too so our                                 company is at carto carto calm we're                                 over at booth number                                                     you if you have any kind of                                 location-based use cases or anything                                 like that any data that you want to                                 analyze in a map-based way to come check                                 us out and and and talk to us and see                                 what we can do for you thank you
