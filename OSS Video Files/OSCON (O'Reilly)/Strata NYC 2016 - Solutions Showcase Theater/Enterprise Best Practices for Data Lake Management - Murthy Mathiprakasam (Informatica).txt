	                              why don't we go ahead and get started                               here anybody else interested in this                               session here we're going to be talking                               about six secrets for succeeding with                               data like management and obviously I                               think I learn a lot of people who are                               interested in the topic of data lakes                               and so what we try to do is well so I'm                               with informatica my name is Murphy with                                you / custom I'm a director there and                                what I wanted to do really quickly in                                you know a short amount of time here it                                just tell you about some of the things                                that our customers have actually told us                                where their best practices with data                                links and I've anonymized everything so                                you know you have to worry about                                anything being super secret or anything                                like that but I think these are actually                                some pretty interesting tips that might                                be of use to a lot of people here so                                first of all let's just be real about it                                David lakes are kind of hard and here                                are a couple quotes from actual                                customers again I'll anonymize about why                                data links are hard there's a lot of                                different it challenges around why data                                lakes are hard first of all it's hard to                                deliver the stuff repeatedly and                                consistently and you can see some of the                                quotes about that it's just hard to get                                up you know value and understanding of                                what the data even is I mean it sounds                                like a great idea that you just dump all                                your data in one place but it's actually                                hard now you got data all over the place                                and it's kind of spread out and you need                                to get into a more centralized place                                number three is that it just takes a                                long time you know it's stuff it is hard                                and so you could end up spending weeks                                actually kind of get value out of the                                data and that's just not acceptable to                                your business users and finally it's                                that you don't really even know if you                                can trust the data because maybe it                                hasn't been scrubbed it's just so raw                                can even use the data for something                                analytical and so there's a lot of                                reasons why data lace can be really                                really hard but obviously a lot of                                people are succeeding with them so let's                                kind of take a look at some of the                                reasons why people or how people succeed                                so one more thing that's actually a                                particularly hard about data Lakes is                                that a lot of people tend to go with a                                fragmented approach so people understand                                that those are the challenges so one of                                the things that makes it even harder is                                that they try to do everything on their                                own they'll try to use like a one-off                                solution just to try to solve like well                                you know a certain part of the problem                                but it's not enough you know how to have                                even sometimes you create more of a                                problem than am a solution and things                                are just super duper fragmented and so                                you don't want to have a fragmented way                                of solving the problem we kind of know                                what the problem is there's data on the                                left-hand side that you're trying to                                bring into your data lake                                you want to help make that available for                                consumption on the right hand side and                                there's a bunch of stuff that needs to                                get happen so just go solve the problem                                in a comprehensive and holistic way so                                here's first best practice we've heard                                from a lot of our customers this is not                                something that like three developers in                                the basement are going to just go figure                                out it really does take a little bit of                                a team to actually go get a lot of value                                out of data lakes and so here a couple                                of roles that we tend to see over and                                over again and a lot of customers and                                you can see kind of what each role does                                and you sort of if you can get these                                guys to kind of work together as an                                agile sort of two group you know                                obviously agile development is a new                                kind of concept of just getting projects                                out the door very very quickly this is a                                great way to have you know teams from                                people from different functions in a                                team together so they can work together                                in their different roles to go deliver                                value at the data like it's a really                                 really key best practice because it                                 avoids the whole kind of waterfall                                 approach of the developer goes and does                                 something to hand it off to the business                                 analyst the analyst says oh what is this                                 it's not what I want you got to go back                                 a lot of the delays that people face or                                 just from the absence of collaboration                                 so just have the collaboration and                                 cross-functional team work from the                                 get-go the second best practice here is                                 and a lot of people talk about this but                                 think about the data like itself as a                                 sort of multi structured kind of                                 environment so instead of it all just                                 being the raw data you can have a fan a                                 landing zone where the data shows up and                                 that's where you start the processing                                 but then you can have kind of an                                 intermediate zone a lot of people call                                 it like a discovery zone this is where                                 your data scientists and people were                                 trying to kind of do experiments with                                 data can go and take a look at the data                                 and play with it and then you can have                                 your kind of final fully prepared you                                 know fully ready for analytics zone but                                 it's just a simple way of organizing                                 what you're doing in Hadoop so that                                 everybody knows okay this is kind of a                                 mess by design this is maybe a little                                 less of a mess then we got data that's                                 really really good and that's where your                                 analytical users should go to third best                                 practice is it to think about how you                                 get around data quality this is one of                                 the biggest challenges for a lot of                                 customers which is like the data is kind                                 of Ross there's a lot of problems that                                 it's inconsistent it's incomplete so                                 you're going to have to have some                                 process for fixing the bugs in the data                                 itself so                                 one of the best practices and this is                                 something I actually got from one of our                                 customers is they actually use an                                 iterative process so what they do is                                 they actually have automated rule-based                                 systems that where they can put in                                 patterns for well here are the things                                 that we want to go scrub out of the data                                 they just run this over and over again                                 continuously and then they can handle                                 the exceptions so if they find out                                 through this processing that there's                                 some bugs in the data they can go and                                 manually remediate those bugs but                                 they're not going through all the data                                 that's in the data lake because that                                 would just be impossible so it's just a                                 way of automating and continuously                                 improving the quality of the data inside                                 the data like fourth best practice is                                 you know people always talk about using                                 the data to get like a                                                 of customers or in other entities well                                 you want to get a                                                      itself because you want to know what is                                 the data because maybe there's data                                 that's sensitive maybe there's data you                                 need to go secure and so you can use                                 different technologies that can scan the                                 data sets that you're putting into the                                 data lake scan it upfront use this kind                                 of metadata intelligence layer and then                                 you use that to power your security your                                 governance because now that you know                                 with the technology what the data even                                 is it can detect if you've got private                                 information or credit card information                                 or healthcare information it can detect                                 that automatically and then it makes the                                 remediation of that from a security                                 governance perspective a lot easier the                                 fifth best practice is just think                                 complete right don't go to the                                 fragmented solution approach so when I                                 say complete there's actually two                                 different versions of this so right here                                 I'm talking about pores not like                                 vertical completeness so get your Hadoop                                 you know system there's obviously a                                 bunch of vendors that provide Hadoop                                 have a data like management solution                                 obviously that's where informatica plays                                 and then also think about having                                 professional services maybe if you need                                 to have people come in and add value to                                 the team's you already have in-house                                 think about your analytics solution are                                 you using data science tools or using                                 reporting and then think about anything                                 that you want to do from an industry and                                 departmental standpoint to like is there                                 is their marketing specific                                 functionality or sales specific                                 functionality just think about the                                 entire problem holistically because you                                 will inevitably have to and so you can                                 get away from all the challenges of a                                 fragmented approach by just looking at                                 the whole problem statement you know                                 end-to-end from a vertical standpoint                                 but completeness isn't just a vertical                                 except it's also horizontally too so i                                 told you about how there's this kind of                                 fragmented approach to having a lot of                                 these different point products and they                                 kind of half solve a problem and then                                 you go realize though i haven't solved                                 some other problem and then you go tack                                 on something like just think about data                                 lake management as a complete problem we                                 already know all the problems you gotta                                 solve to have a complete data lake so                                 just solve it all at once there's no                                 reason I mean you can have a methodical                                 process of doing one step you know first                                 and doing another step second but just                                 think about the entire thing up front in                                 your design process and again                                 informatica we offer solutions across                                 the board here so it's a great way to                                 just think about okay I'm going to build                                 a data lake I need to have comprehensive                                 support I need to have metadata                                 intelligence I need to have all these                                 capabilities brought together and that's                                 how you take the data that's raw on the                                 left hand side and make it available for                                 consumption on the right hand side so I                                 just kind of end with a couple quotes                                 from some of our customers again I                                 wanted you know reflect more on what our                                 customers say but this is a really                                 really powerful quotes almost a little                                 bit emotional because the customer is                                 talking about how hard it was to trust                                 the data in the data like it's a very                                 big problem a lot of customers have and                                 now they're using those tools from like                                 us to have this kind of information                                 management hub and they're doing exactly                                 what I'm talking about this end-to-end                                 approach where they can bring in data                                 from                                                                    a very aggressive customer and they                                 bring it into a central location they                                 can improve the quality they use the                                 automation and they can actually get                                 great stuff coming out the other end so                                 here's a customer who's succeeding with                                 the data like I'll give you one more                                 example this is also the customer was                                 almost crying when they said this they                                 said this is the first time the first                                 time ever that we're getting data back                                 into the source system that's actually                                 really good now how many customers do                                 you know who can actually say that right                                 and you know we talked about want to do                                 this all the stuff but it never gets                                 done well these guys did it and so this                                 is really the idea behind taking a                                 holistic end-to-end approach like your                                 net it's not a problem that you have to                                 go think about it takes two years or                                 three years to solve you can think about                                 this vertically and horizontally is a                                 complete way and that's what you know                                 the end goal really is to get value out                                 of these data legs so if you're                                 interested in learning more we've got a                                 booth here at strata so please
