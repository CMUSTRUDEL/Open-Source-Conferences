	                              so my name is Rob mastered I'm the CEO                               of a company called galactic exchange                               and I'm going to talk to you to diameter                               answer the two biggest questions I know                               it's on the tip of everybody's mind if                               that's an expression two things you want                               to know today are you know does Big Data                               really have to be so hard because it is                               hard and who the hell are acting                                exchange anyway so let me start with the                                with the second point who we are so                                we're a start-up we're based out of                                despite my dulcet tones I live in                                Northern California I now I have a                                Southern California accent but we're                                based out of north California and we                                also have a development team in in                                Ukraine and we make unreasonably simple                                clusters for big data which in a                                nutshell you can read the paragraph                                there but when it comes to deploying                                infrastructure and then when it comes to                                deploying the applications that use that                                infrastructure when it comes to sourcing                                the data that's going to be imported                                into that infrastructure it's pretty                                pretty tough and we simplify that that                                whole process probably by one or two                                orders of magnitude so in a nutshell                                we're in the simplification business so                                just to reinforce that some some IDC                                numbers the big data analytics market is                                already big so per IDC                                                 dollars and it's going to grow by about                                fifty percent over the next three or                                four years to you know just shy of                                    billion dollars but what's interesting                                and kind of reinforces our position is                                that more than half of that revenue is                                going to be based on services so people                                that you know come along to your premise                                you know an army of consultants who who                                help do the heavy lifting to make stuff                                work now we're not going to be putting                                consultants out of business be great we                                could get a                                                             of consulting business for our software                                but the reality is that's not going to                                happen however we believe that in a lot                                of the non interesting stuff i mean                                people deploy all this infrastructure in                                these analytics to get you know useful                                business insights and you know a lot of                                that consulting work and money is spent                                doing                                what we describe is the grunt work                                deploying the infrastructure getting the                                data into the infrastructure loading the                                applications as opposed to actually                                running the applications and getting                                that business inside that you want so                                there's always going to be business for                                consultants to do that kind of work but                                it's good that they're doing the real                                interesting work than just the busy work                                of worrying about the infrastructure so                                my dad always used to say to me that's                                my dad bless him if it was easy                                everybody would be doing it and I always                                thought that he made that expression up                                and then I discovered that actually it's                                a expression everybody uses but it's                                true for big data as well you know if it                                was easy everybody would be doing it and                                we think that everybody should be doing                                it now I'm not supposed to a sales pitch                                for the company I'm going to kind of                                wrap it around a case study now where                                early-stage company we're actually just                                entering the beta process of our product                                and if you're interested please come to                                our website and request beta access but                                we do have people that were working with                                with pre-release software and the                                specific case study on and talk to you                                about is an analytics vendor who shall                                remain nameless although they are at                                this event and they specifically sell to                                Fortune                                                     organizations and their product is a you                                know seven-figure recurring annual fee                                for the for the analytics service that                                they provide and they they're analyzing                                terabytes of data on a on a daily and                                weekly basis so it's big business so                                when it comes to doing proof of concepts                                when people are going to be paying out                                that kind of money they're not prepared                                to just do a proof of concept based on a                                 single node sandbox environment they                                 want to deploy a real cluster deploy the                                 application and kind of run this real is                                 this stuff for several weeks if not                                 several months before they're going to                                 sign a check so the problem that they                                 have and you know there's a list of                                 things here you'll see them you know                                 every every POC requires a full-blown                                 cluster and that's complicated their                                 expectation is always that the app                                 vendor has to come in and build that                                 cluster and so they tell us even if they                                 send in one of their best engineers most                                 skilled engineers once they've got that                                 applicator that cluster deployed and                                 then their preference is to use Cloudera                                 cdh when they've got that cluster                                 deployed and the applique                                 deployed it's typically taken at least a                                 day if not a couple of days to get that                                 all up and running and that's for a                                 skilled engineer so if you have somebody                                 who's not a skilled engineer or somebody                                 who's never had experience you're                                 talking many many days and often weeks                                 and then you've got air fares and hotels                                 and and you know there's simply not                                 enough engineers so the net net of it in                                 their environment is they have to be                                 very selective about the POC process who                                 they say yes who they say no to and Lily                                 their whole sales pipeline is                                 engineering manpower constrained so the                                 solution fell enough we have a solution                                 for them our product is called cluster                                 GX and it it allows them to do there's                                 two parts to the solution the first part                                 is just building the Hadoop                                 infrastructure so using the cluster GX                                 platform you can build a Hadoop spark                                 infrastructure you can you can download                                 and build a virtualized and we use                                 containers for our virtualization                                 technology you can take bare metal                                 machines Linux machines you can even                                 take Windows or Mac machines and you can                                 turn them into a cluster running you                                 know Cloudera patchy shortly map our                                 horn works and you can have those things                                 up and running in literally                                       minutes even five minutes if you if you                                 if you're quick with no experience                                 needed you don't have to understand                                 virtualization you don't have to                                 understand how to spark big date or any                                 of those things it's just if you can if                                 you can install an application like                                 Skype you can you can create a loop                                 spark cluster okay so now the customer                                 can do that job they don't have to rely                                 on the on the vendor to come out and do                                 that job and then secondly we have an                                 integrated app store within the within                                 the within the cluster now you can                                 manually load any applications that you                                 want but through the integrated app                                 store we have the ability for the client                                 to through a single click fire up the                                 application and configure all the Hadoop                                 settings bring up any software                                 dependencies if they need imperil Cat                                 Cora things like that we can get those                                 things up and running as well sort out                                 all the addressing so you're really                                 ready to go you're ready to start                                 importing your data and get on with                                 doing the real business so from a                                       standpoint this two-part mechanism is a                                 is a you know solution                                 for not just this specific analytics                                 vendor but there are a number of analyst                                 expanders who see the same benefit so                                 the power of simple simplification pocs                                 can be done with very limited resources                                 with unskilled engineers by customers                                 themselves so from the from the                                 analytics vendors standpoint they never                                 have to say no to a proof-of-concept                                 every proof of concept is a yes it's                                 just a mess just a matter of whether you                                 going to provide telephone support or                                 on-site support but even more important                                 than that they can actually start to                                 think about expanding the target target                                 customer that they sell to because right                                 now they're typically selling to Fortune                                                                                                      they expect those companies to have                                 sophisticated IT teams big data teams                                 that can deal with deploying a complex                                 product like this but if we can take                                 that complexity of deployment away and                                 management away then they can start to                                 think about moving down the stack and                                 vastly broadening the number of                                 customers that they sell to so you know                                 in a nutshell if we believe that big                                 data is a good thing for everyone then                                 we think that everyone should be doing                                 it so hopefully I answer those two                                 questions is it harder you get I think                                 everybody knows it's hard and hopefully                                 now you have a little bit of an idea                                 about who we are thank you for listening                                 we're actually go acting exchange we're
