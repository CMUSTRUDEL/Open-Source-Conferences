	                              we're going to start this demo about                               these racing cars here and talk a little                               bit about that the first thing we want                               to do is show you a little bit of a                               video so if you guys want to see a video                               about what we're working on just please                               a take your eyes and take a look at the                               screen this is stuart Coggins i'm john                               gray's and we were with oracle                                so we have over there in boots                                         game it's called an key and what this                                game has is very smart cars that go                                around the track and you can play this                                game on a tablet but what we wanted to                                do is demonstrate how you can take                                something very ordinary like this this                                game is quite fun fun to have a go with                                it and get real-time analytics from it                                without actually modifying the game and                                the way we do this and also to look for                                particular events the way we do it is                                through these bluetooth sniffers that                                are actually capturing the data as the                                game is going by and the real point of                                that and one of the things we're doing                                with oracle is showing how you can take                                an ordinary process or an existing                                system and start to be clever with IOT                                to enable some of the big data                                capabilities within the company so in                                this game we haven't modified this game                                but we can detect things like a car                                crash and and see an event that goes                                into our stream analytics tool and see                                that it's critical in start up a process                                in our process cloud service to                                determine maybe we should launch a drone                                and go incident response to begin to                                take a look at the things that are                                happening there take some photos and                                upload them into our document cloud                                service and determine if there's a fire                                something that's going on there maybe we                                need to do a response and send an                                ambulance or send a emergency vehicle                                they're all these kinds of concepts are                                things that we in today's world are                                starting to see where so many different                                devices that we have are generating                                enormous amounts of data what can we do                                with that we can be reactive we can look                                at real time analytics but we can also                                take that data and put it up into our                                big data analysis tools and determine                                what cars are the fastest in which one                                which one excuse me which race tracks                                are our better race tracks so it's all                                about having IOT and the things that we                                have around us                                to enable some of that big data so it's                                not just enough to have a big data                                platform you want all the things around                                it in the cloud and different services                                to be able to do this work so here's                                some samples that may be using obd in a                                car rather than the Bluetooth sniffers                                that we have in our demonstration how we                                can use different maps to determine                                where things are so a lot of power in                                IOT to be able to enable some of the big                                data platforms and how they work                                together so Stuart my colleague here is                                going to bring up a little just a couple                                slides we have this racetrack all                                running there in boot                                                much at the end of the wall to hey over                                here you can go have a race take a look                                and see some of the tools that we have                                available there and if you go to the                                next slide there Stewart this is what we                                have from an architecture point of view                                we have these pieces just this cars that                                are generating all this traffic we have                                these sniffers that are picking up that                                traffic and going into our i OT cloud                                service so one of the things that we                                want to really get across with this                                demonstration is to have a platform for                                innovation we didn't have to set up                                computers and do all the things to get                                that data all we did is have the data                                available bring it into our cloud right                                away so when you look at that table over                                there you'll notice there's no computers                                they're all this there is a little tiny                                Raspberry Pi and it immediately takes                                the data almost raw and sends it up into                                the cloud into our iot cloud service                                once we get it there then we make some                                 decisions when we go into our process                                 cloud for real-time analytics and that                                 can determine if there's an accident                                 something's going on something's wrong                                 sent a drone send an ambulance so the                                 source of the date is the same going                                 into our process cloud taking                                 photographs our service if a car needs                                 maintenance the same source of data can                                 then go to our database cloud for some                                 dashboards real-time dashboards and then                                 over time into our big data or their bi                                 cloud service for analyzing things over                                 time we have about                                                    being                                 around the world and we're capturing                                 data from all those and determining                                 fastest cars and and different patterns                                 that are there all because of a little                                 bit of data being generated from an IOT                                 point of view so I'm going to turn over                                 to Stewart he's kind of the big data                                 guru i work on generating the data and                                 he's the one that then takes it does                                 some things with it so if he wants to                                 talk a little bit about a big data so                                 despite our accents were both from                                 Australia so the shrewd ones amongst you                                 were to notice that we were driving on                                 the wrong side of the road in that video                                 and if anyone even noticed that in                                 Australia we drive on the same size as                                 England so despite we have an American                                 and a brick we aren't you from Oracle                                 Australia we have been running this demo                                 for quite some time and over time we've                                 sort of come to look at the the way we                                 use data and put data into action that                                 the way we look at it is that if you                                 don't do something with your data                                 there's no point in collecting it and if                                 you do really good analytics and                                 insights you'll need really good data to                                 do so so the whole idea is these                                 principles that we work with which is                                 that data comes from activity so what                                 you'll see in the demo is the cars are                                 generating a heap of data I know these                                 are toy cars but it's the same sort of                                 data you get from a real vehicle so                                 we're seeing lots of each wheel                                 independently census data as well as                                 where it physically is on the track so                                 there's quite a lot going on it's also                                 streaming at a rate of knots at is                                 ridiculous so you know data is becoming                                 extremely fast we've reduced the                                 bottleneck by using a raspberry pi and                                 we're streaming that as John mentioned                                 through our Internet of Things pride                                 service at that point we can do some                                 event processing we can then push it                                 back through into real-time monitoring                                 and that's where we start to render                                 real-time dashboard so the game itself                                 is a game played on iPads but it doesn't                                 give us any of these dashboarding so we                                 just enhance the game just a little bit                                 just to give it a bit more fun and then                                 we can do some post-race analytics what                                 we're beginning to see                                 is that the patterns of the cars give us                                 some interesting story so when the track                                 gets dirtier and dirtier the tires get                                 dirtier like our own do and the cars                                 start to fishtail on the day now whilst                                 we can visibly see that we're actually                                 seeing that pattern in our analytic                                 space as well so the car the rear wheels                                 become inconsistent with each other so                                 we're starting to see patterns kind of a                                 predictive maintenance the other idea is                                 this reactive where data creates more                                 data so what happens is IOT is seeing                                 that event the car coming off the track                                 and we react to that as John's mentioned                                 maybe we we learned some sort of process                                 we do incident response we have an                                 ambulance or fire truck a drone we can                                 use notifications to decide which one of                                 these will need to do so this idea that                                 data is creating more data we use the                                 drone to capture photos so we can see                                 what sort of response should we make                                 obviously there's the drone in action                                 they're taking some photos and then with                                 those are stored and that data becomes                                 an asset so what we start to see is this                                 collection of data over time we've been                                 running this demo for about eight months                                 we've collected a heap of data it's a                                 different track usually every time and                                 so we're starting to see some                                 interesting insights now and if you do                                 come over and take a look at the demo                                 what you'll see is people and hopefully                                 yourselves thinking of how you can put                                 this to use in your own organizations or                                 and completely not related to vehicles                                 that these these IOT devices could be                                 could be anything so and on one thing to                                 note we haven't changed the game we                                 haven't hacked the game it's exactly as                                 it comes out of the box so it's an                                 interesting point to note and I think                                 that's pretty much your son John
