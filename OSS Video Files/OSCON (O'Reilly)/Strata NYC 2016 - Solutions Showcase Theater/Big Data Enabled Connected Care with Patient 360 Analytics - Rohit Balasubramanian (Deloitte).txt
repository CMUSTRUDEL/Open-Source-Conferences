	                              good evening everyone I'm Rohit                               Balasubramaniam specialist leader and                               deloitte means a couple of things it                               means I get to present our point of view                               on patient and connected care for the                               next                                                                 the guy standing between you and happy                               hour so i'll keep my point of view very                               focused i basically help my clients                                drive their business agendas around                                disruptive technologies and analytics                                which is things such as big data and the                                Internet of Things right if you if you                                look at market researchers basically                                what they're saying about the Internet                                of Things really is that by                                          expect over                                                         connected to the Internet if you ask                                people depending on who you ask the                                revenue estimates from the Internet of                                Things is expected to go anywhere from                                                                                                       who you ask so clearly it's a                                significant potential and we at Deloitte                                are adopting the Internet of Things that                                analytics as a significant driver of our                                growth when it comes to analytics and                                information management okay now what                                we're seeing in the marketplace is that                                there is a fair amount of traction for                                analytics around big data and I or D                                across industry sectors so you have                                traction in retail you have traction in                                consumer and industrial products and of                                course you have traction in life                                sciences and healthcare which is where                                today's presentation is all about okay                                so moving forward if you think about the                                imperative of Internet of Things in                                healthcare there are four key things                                which are really driving IOT in                                healthcare                                one is of course connected devices I                                mean now there is information from muley                                connected devices which can augment the                                information around patients from                                traditional sources so that's a key                                driver and a disruptor mobile technology                                has either increased and basically                                advanced in leaps and bounds and                                everyone wants to do things on their app                                and they're on their iPhone or on their                                mobile phones so that's a key disruptor                                and an opportunity big data of course                                now you can store all kinds of data you                                know at various levels of volume and                                variety and basically mine it for                                insights so that's another disruptor                                which is which is creating opportunities                                for IOT in healthcare and last but not                                least you know there is this extreme                                market regulations which have prevented                                folks from really embracing the power of                                IOT in healthcare and that too is an                                opportunity which can be tapped but                                having said that even with the adoption                                of this newer technology and these newer                                disruptors you know value generation is                                really very siloed when we think about                                healthcare we think about the domain in                                terms of two big buckets right we think                                about the engagement domain so you have                                the health in activity monitors or                                people who are creating those mobile and                                wellness developers local engagers                                telecom companies to name a few and on                                the other side of the equation you have                                the enterprise domain which is health                                information exchanges providers Pharma                                large employers but they are all acting                                within their own silos when it comes to                                trying and creating wealth with the                                adoption of newer technology exponential                                value generation truly lies in joining                                the enterprise and the engagement                                domains to create integrated insights                                and that's really what this solution of                                today is all about so I'm going to talk                                to you a little bit about deloitte's                                connected health and patient engagement                                solution let me real quickly get to                                the solution itself from an overview                                perspective you know this solution has                                been created to predict patient outcomes                                specifically around cardiovascular                                mortality by matching it with patient                                behavior as well so you actually get to                                see in a connected cells how                                cardiovascular mortality can be                                 monitored and managed from three                                 different perspectives the platform and                                 the solution itself is hosted on                                 Deloitte's platform as a service                                 capability there is a cloud-based                                 patient CRM solution involved in jizz we                                 have our own dicaire mobile app which is                                 based on the Android operating system                                 right now and we are working to get iOS                                 into the mix as well and of course then                                 we have dashboards which rendered                                 analytics and information through                                 tableau as well that in essence is the                                 underpinnings of the solution it will                                 what does the solution do well it                                 basically seeks to connect patients with                                 care providers who are doctors as well                                 as clinicians and the glue to all of                                 this is basically getting information or                                 data in real time from medical devices                                 okay so if you think about it from a                                 from a use case perspective a clinician                                 like Joe for example does a few things                                 he basically enrolls a patient into a                                 particular into the solution and into a                                 patient monitoring program in the event                                 where in real time to pick the solution                                 receives things or alerts that either                                 some kind of a patient vital is going                                 across a predefined threshold or there                                 is a case for a medical implanted device                                 not working like it's supposed to joy is                                 then able to take certain actions such                                 as scheduling the patient to meet with                                 her doctor in this case                                 from the patient's perspective I mean we                                 have a patient now let's say with an                                 implanted device he or she can actually                                 get things in real time so that so that                                 they can take corrective action and                                 reaching out to the doctor and say I                                 think there's something wrong with me I                                 need to reach out to you or there's                                 something wrong with my device and                                 that's kind of the same case when you                                 think about from a doctor's perspective                                 basically a doctor is able to receive                                 alerts in real time from across a whole                                 spectrum of his or her patients and then                                 be able to look into it take corrective                                 action scheduled the patient for either                                 to come into to basically come into his                                 office or whatever the appropriate                                 action needs to be okay the solution has                                 predefined thresholds built into it                                 based on a whole host of criteria such                                 as you know gender such as target age                                 and what you basically see here is for                                 this particular patient we have                                 highlighted a target range for the aged                                 between                                                             looking at things such as heart rates we                                 are looking at things such as calorie                                 intake and we are basically in real time                                 matching vitals blood pressure if you                                 will with activity so if the solution                                 basically gets a real-time pain that                                 someone's blood pressure has gone up                                 beyond a particular threshold at the                                 same time that person is really not                                 taking any kind of measurable activity                                 based on their Fitbit let's say that                                 generates an alert that generates a                                 warning but also able to we're also able                                 to you know aggregate information from                                 across patients via batcycle and then do                                 analytics through tableau dashboards                                 which are also very important for                                 stakeholders such as pairs stakeholders                                 such as insurance companies and so and                                 so and so forth so really what the                                 solution is doing is triangulating is                                 basically providing a real time                                 analytics platform and solution to                                 triangulate between various stakeholders                                 such as the patient the physician the                                 clinician and then the pairs as well so                                 you have a four-pronged if you will                                 integrated real time interaction model                                 for patient monitoring and connected                                 care that in essence is the solution                                 I'll leave you with a nice visual in                                 terms of the architecture which                                 underlies all of this as you can see                                 there are two packs the path on the top                                 is for bringing streaming real-time data                                 into the ecosystem we bring in things                                 such as patient history and patient                                 enrollment through a batch process mash                                 it up do analytics in real time and the                                 render the analytics either through a                                 mobile alert as I said on an Android                                 device or through tableau dashboards on                                 a bat-cycle quick questions                                 can you repeat that I'm sorry continue                                 so the question is the information that                                 you use for batch processing do you also                                 need to use it in the real time okay                                 absolutely for example one of the pieces                                 that comes in through the batch are                                 those thresholds and the business rules                                 which get stored right in real time we                                 get a ping from your medical device                                 which says here's my vitals we match                                 that against those thresholds and then                                 we take action appropriate action based                                 on you know that confluence I think                                 we're out of time thank you very much
