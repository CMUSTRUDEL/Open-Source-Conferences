	                              good morning everyone my name is itamar                               am the chief marketing officer for                               eternity a provider of data integration                               and big data management software                               solutions today we're going to talk                               about efficient data in just at scale                               using CDC change the captcha technology                               with at unity replicate technologies                               like Kafka and more very briefly                                stunning about attunity we're a data                                integration bigoted management software                                company this year recognized by Gartner                                as a challenger in a data integration                                tools market and we help companies to                                use the data we're in a when they need                                it across the diverse type of technology                                platforms so we help accelerate data                                delivery and availability across                                different platforms analytic                                environments and the cloud we have                                automate data readiness for analytics                                and we have analyzed the usage of data                                across big data environments so you can                                optimize performance and their costs we                                focus on Hadoop and big data we focus on                                the cloud and data were seeing we have                                over                                                                 with global offices if you look at the                                solutions we provide it's across                                different type of environments and for                                Hadoop and big data we help companies                                with data interest and streaming                                interest with kafka with edw offload and                                with a dupe data usage and workload                                analytics today we're going to focus on                                data in jerz and innovations in that                                space first I want to share customer                                story well care is a large provider of                                managed care health plans and their                                challenge was to create and accelerate                                an optimized data angels process really                                for improving analytics and the reason I                                need to improve analytics was to get                                better way to manage your patients as                                well as to meet regularly compare                                compliance requirements to do that they                                need to ingest data for many different                                types of sources different databases                                they use sequel server oracle and others                                and high volumes and with lower latency                                and they need to do that on a continuous                                basis so they can support the real-time                                analytics and efficient way to move data                                into their analytic platform so to do                                that they use the tunity replicate and i                                will explain more about it and the                                approach is the challenges of the richer                                they were facing and how I them and                                other customers are addressing it today                                so taking a step back and look at the                                evolving customer needs and challenges                                in respect to data interest enabling                                data lakes and big data analytics me                                the things we're seeing customers are                                looking for easy ingest they don't want                                to write custom code for every interest                                they want to do they want to do                                continuous in real-time data in just so                                they can support real-time analytics                                they want to support data from coming                                from many different sources and also                                going to many different consumers off                                the data they want to scale analytics                                want to scale the interest process to                                support hundreds we're even going on the                                thousands when we work with                                     companies of endpoints they want to                                manage it at scale and they want have                                low impact on their environments so                                these are all considerations that as you                                go and look for solutions to build the                                data interest infrastructure for to                                support your big data analytics                                environment this is what are we seeing                                customers look for so what kind of                                solutions can you try and find to                                address these needs and challenges first                                is look for automation tools that can                                automate the data in jerz process                                definition photonic solutions that                                enable says CDC which is change data                                capture that the technology that knows                                how to capture data as it changes so                                it's a very efficient way to move data                                as well as enables real-time data in                                jest with kafka integrations so you can                                support streaming type of data                                integration processes in Eden a true                                genius and a scalable platform to                                 support a lot of different environments                                 and scale and you need an integrated                                 management or a management capability to                                 support a large scale and operationalize                                 large-scale environment that have                                 hundreds maybe thousands of data feeds                                 going on we had control of them and                                 finally if you want to get low impact                                 you need the technology that can reduce                                 the impact on your existing IT                                 infrastructure and IT resources well                                 that's what we by the way do in eternity                                 eternity replicate when focusing on                                 expanding our product and aligning it                                 with this evolving market needs and                                 demands by customers providing an agile                                 modern platform for ingesting and                                 replicating data across a wide variety                                 of systems including all call all                                 relational databases data world systems                                 Hadoop and big data platforms kafka                                 on-premise as well as in the cloud with                                 optimizations designed to make the                                 process easy while from a user                                 experience perspective you habitually                                 can very easily be configured in order                                 to get the process you want in place so                                 we have one unifying                                 universal platform to get data ingested                                 across a wide variety of systems so you                                 can support different analytic                                 environments where you want to run your                                 analytics so quickly going through it                                 with the tunity replicate you can                                 accelerate data in just so you have a                                 very easy to use environment where you                                 can go in and configure the process you                                 want to do you just set up the right                                 optimization depending on the pattern in                                 which you want the data ingested into                                 your data environment whether it's a                                 dupe whether it's Kafka whether it's                                 data where else whether it's in the                                 cloud all the optimizations are built in                                 and you simply select the right                                 optimization that you want to use we                                 also support continuously dangerous                                 attunity is a leading pioneer in CDC                                 change data capture technology we                                 support CDC for a lot of different                                 databases so that means that you can set                                 up a process that with very low impact                                 with high-efficiency real-time captures                                 changes from many different databases it                                 can bring them to other targets we have                                 offered different options of doing CDC                                 including a message oriented CDC which                                 takes the changes turn the database into                                 a live feed that you cannot feed                                 directly into Kafka and other similar                                 technologies in order to merge it into                                 your analytic process when you go to                                 Kafka replicate makes that a smooth                                 process taking the data out of the                                 database that is captured putting into a                                 format that works for the kafka                                 environment for example in json or other                                 type of data formats enabling you to                                 very easily configure how the data gets                                 distributed into the kafka cues and so a                                 pic so you can get it into the                                 environment you want and easily                                 configure it for downstream processing                                 replicate supports a lot of sources and                                 a lot of targets so again it's a                                 platform that gives you a unified way to                                 induce data across the wide variety of                                 systems so a lot of databases lots of                                 data where else is all of these                                 available both on Prem as well as in the                                 cloud with the right optimizations for                                 each one of these scenarios finally                                 replicate provides use earful pin                                 architecture so a very unique CDC                                 technology in the market that does not                                 require any agents on the source systems                                 other technologies that do CDC require                                 agents on source database systems that                                 creates impact as you need to install                                 secure maintain                                 upgrade those environments attunity has                                 an agentless or zero footprint                                 architecture for the most common                                 database systems like Oracle and sequel                                 server db                                                            that allows you to reduce the impact                                 especially when you start to scale so if                                 you look at scaling and you're going to                                 run hundreds maybe thousands of data of                                 our feeds having agents across that                                 environment is just too hard to maintain                                 requiring developer efforts for each one                                 of these is too much so what eternity is                                 done is made that process easy finally                                 providing a tunity Enterprise Manager                                 which we've announced here at this show                                 which is an extension of attunity                                 replicate provided integrated management                                 for managing hundreds and thousands of                                 feeds you can see them all in one place                                 you can group them you can filter them                                 you can show them you can drill down you
