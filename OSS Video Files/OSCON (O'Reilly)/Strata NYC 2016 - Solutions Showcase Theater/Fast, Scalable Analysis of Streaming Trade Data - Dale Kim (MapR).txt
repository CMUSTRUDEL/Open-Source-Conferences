	                              hi everyone my name is Dale Kim welcome                               to my presentation and I'm here to talk                               about high speed streaming analytics so                               hopefully you're familiar with Matt Barr                               technologies but if you're not you can                               think of us as one of the big Hadoop                               providers but we actually deal a bit                               more than that so we provide a converged                               data platform and what that means is                                that all the technologies that you're                                probably familiar with in a big data                                context we provide in one platform on a                                single cluster so you can think of                                Hadoop spark seek one and do with Apache                                drill all open source projects running                                on top of the platform that we've built                                that includes web scale storage there's                                no sequel databases as well as streams                                so the benefit of this by having them                                all on the same cluster is that no                                longer do you have to deal with data                                movement between different silos so                                there's a lot of low latency                                improvements there but also you get a                                unified framework around administration                                and security so a lot of operational                                efficiency benefits there so there's a                                lot to learn you can add our booth I'll                                just leave it at that and talk a little                                bit more about the solution so we're                                talking with a financial services                                customer who has many financial services                                companies as their own customers and                                what the requirement is is providing an                                analytics platform where their customers                                can see what types of bids and asks or                                trade data is being delivered so they                                get a better understanding of what                                prices they can use for setting bids and                                asks when working with other banks so                                this is not part of the public exchanges                                these are trades that are being                                happening that are happening between                                different financial services companies                                and so they want to be able to ask                                questions like you know what offers did                                a particular sender send within the last                                                                                                        particular recipient receive so there's                                a lot of information to cover there's a                                lot of queries that you can run one of                                the interesting challenges is the fact                                that the initial information that comes                                in is in the form of a bid or an ask                                from a particular sender but oftentimes                                those bids and asks are sent to                                specifics recipients and so that scales                                out the amount of data points that they                                have to control and the amount of data                                points they have to query so what is the                                problem so you know the advantage is                                having a service that they can query                                over bids and ask get a lot                                good information of that on behalf of                                their customers so they can make better                                decisions but the challenge when you                                think about big data you know the                                      the volume velocity and variety velocity                                is the one thing that really stands out                                above above the rest so certainly when                                you have a lot of velocity the volume                                will eventually be a problem as well but                                but interestingly it's the speed that's                                the biggest challenge now this isn't a                                new solution they are doing some of this                                right now but they're unable to scale                                they're unable to provide more                                information to to gain competitive                                advantage to sell more of these                                solutions to their end customers so the                                ingest problem is one aspect where                                you're getting hundreds of thousands of                                bids or asks per second coming into the                                system so how do you ingest that in a                                very performant way and then from there                                once you have it in the system how are                                you able to ask a wide variety of                                questions with very low latency across                                all of this data and so like I said they                                have solutions in place but they're                                unable to scale even further and they're                                looking for something that will help                                them to grow out the solution so the                                solution is using our platform but                                architecting it in a way that not only                                supports agile development but also                                supports the the performance and                                scalability requirements so if you look                                at this diagram on the far left this is                                 a micro service that does the ingestion                                 and if you're not familiar with this                                 notion of Micra services think of them                                 as simple simply small application or                                 task specific applications that really                                 do one thing do it well and when you                                 when you created a solution based on                                 micro services yeah it is modularizing                                 the entire solution but that means that                                 you can have smaller groups working on                                 specific components you can easily use                                 them and this type of architecture works                                 extremely well in a big data environment                                 particularly a streaming environment and                                 you can connect all those streams are                                 all those micro services together with a                                 streaming framework underneath and so in                                 this example in the far left you see the                                 ingestion micro service that takes all                                 the data plugs it into the platform into                                 the streaming engine specifically and                                 then now you've got it stored but now                                 there's the query part so remember the                                 high speed querying as another component                                 that's going to be a challenge and so                                 the way we handle that is breaking up                                 the queer                                 the transactions in two separate pieces                                 but based on recipient so you remember I                                 said that each bidder or or ask has                                 multiple recipients that are specified                                 and so we can break up that single                                 transaction into multiple data points                                 based on the receivers store those in                                 the streams and now we have a stream as                                 a system of record upon which you can do                                 the querying so now you can ask specific                                 questions about what bids and asks a                                 particular sender has received and so                                 you can get get very fast responsiveness                                 there you also also can save a lot of                                 this information into our no sequel                                 database or or or map our DB                                 specifically so that you can do                                 historical querying so if they wanted to                                 do an analysis about what are the trends                                 over time you know what are the                                 correlations between time of day or                                 between any events going on in the world                                 they can do that as well but again the                                 focus was on on speed and how to do                                 real-time querying on this incoming                                 stream so as to best understand what                                 prices are appropriate for a particular                                 trades so what is the end result so this                                 wasn't a solution around cutting costs                                 but more about creating more competitive                                 advantage so building out the solution                                 providing more value to their customers                                 and of course with enough resources with                                 enough money with enough hardware they                                 could have used their existing                                 technology to scale out but they're not                                 going to create a better solution by                                 throwing a lot of money at it they need                                 a lot of efficiency they need to be able                                 to do it in a cost-effective way and                                 that's where this solution using micro                                 services using a streaming architecture                                 built on top of the map are converged                                 data platform has been very useful so if                                 you look at this example this is a very                                 specialized and very specific example of                                 a streaming environment that leverages                                 microservices to do you know a number of                                 tasks within a high-speed pipeline and                                 if you think about it this streaming                                 environment applies to many different                                 industries you can think of adtech or                                 telecommunications or automotive oops                                 as some of the industries that can take                                 advantage of the notion of high-speed                                 streaming and even some industries don't                                 even need to care about the high street                                 speed streaming part just having streams                                 as a system of record provides a new way                                 of thinking about data so if you think                                 about data is always being new and new                                 data points coming in using streams as                                 that baseline store you can run queries                                 on that to best understand what's going                                 on in real time and so we have a lot                                 more information about this if you're                                 interested we have demos showing this                                 solution ingesting data at rates of over

        our technology in general feel free to                                 stop by and let me know and of course if                                 you want to check out the application                                 that i just described it is downloadable                                 you can get it and start up and running                                 with our free downloadable software or                                 on our sandbox it's at ww MapR calm /                                 app blueprint and so that talks not only                                 about this specific solution but more                                 the notion of converged applications so                                 this notion of courage application                                 simply means that if you take a view                                 from analytics where you do a lot of                                 large-scale analytics but want to do it                                 on real time data that is supported and                                 if you take a look from the other angle                                 of the operational side you might be                                 building business applications and you                                 want access to all your historical data                                 that too is possible within our platform                                 and a lot of the efficiencies that we've                                 built over the years enable such a                                 platform you typically think of                                 applications or I'm sorry analytics in                                 in operations as two distinct beasts                                 into statistics silos and we're trying                                 to integrate and merge the two so that                                 you get a lot more value from all of                                 your data so my name is Dale Kim thanks                                 for attending hope you enjoyed the talk
