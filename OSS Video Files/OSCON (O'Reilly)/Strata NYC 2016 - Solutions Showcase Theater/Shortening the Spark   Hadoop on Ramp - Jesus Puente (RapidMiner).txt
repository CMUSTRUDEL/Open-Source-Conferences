	                              my name is Chris was plenty i'm broke                               manager in at rapidminer and first of                               all thank you for for attending and                               giving us this opportunity to to show                               you what we do at rapidminer with with                               some of our customers too well I'll show                               one one example so first rapidminer how                               we define us is as a we are on very easy                               to use modern analytics platform and by                                that we mean by a platform specifically                                what we mean is that we we can we have a                                software that can design different                                workflows different analytic processes                                and once this this processes are there                                we can move them to a production                                environment we can integrate them into                                the anything that's in the in the data                                center so it's not just simply a                                designer it's something like a full                                platform right and and we can deal with                                data in all kinds of environments in                                with databases with social data with                                Hadoop and and so on what some analysts                                say about us is very good I mean in                                Gardner we are we have been in the in                                the leaders quadrant since these                                analytics platform quadrant exists also                                from Romans performer in enforce their                                Howard reznor and and so on but well                                enough about us just talking about this                                this example about it was a                                multinational telco and telcos are a bit                                special because apart from all the                                typical data that most companies have                                about their own customers and that they                                use for chair nor for other use cases                                telcos have a huge wealth of of data in                                their networks it's it's probably the                                vertical where more you can find more                                and more data related to to customers                                and how customers use the network in                                this case so this this particular                                company had various different use cases                                among them very typical churn or                                retention customer segmentation because                                they wanted to be able to create a very                                specific offering for each of the                                customer groups also predictive                                maintenance because of the of the                                network so they had their own                                infrastructure and it was very important                                for them to have enough data to know                                when something had to be replaced how to                                plan ahead the improvement of the of the                                network or even the well how this                                infrastructure could or should grow                                right what was the challenge that they                                have and it's a challenge that we find                                basically in in you know companies that                                have the data mostly in Hadoop well one                                of the things is Hadoop is really                                complex it's not really a technology                                it's a full ecosystem where you find the                                MapReduce the old MapReduce but you have                                now spark you have hive you have yarn                                you have lots of different things so                                when you want to deal with that when you                                want to to use your data you have to                                learn a lot of a lot of technologies so                                you need very specialized people with                                with a lot of deep knowledge in this in                                this technology and it's difficult to                                integrate right it's something like this                                they had in this in this particular                                company they had I think seven team they                                had people who knew a lot about their                                own business in this case about the                                telco business how their users behave                                what their needs were they also knew how                                to deal with data but it was it's                                difficult to to have someone who has all                                this dis knowledge who knows about data                                about mathematics about technology and                                about the business which is in the end                                the most important thing so how did we                                help how is rapid manner better in that                                in that environment well the change was                                from having to have all these these                                people coding learning complex                                technologies keeping up with new                                versions and and so on to having these                                purely visual development environment at                                rapidminer studio where the technology                                is really managed by bias by rapidminer                                studio so the users only need to to                                worry about the business needs and let's                                say what they want to do with the date                                right but let's say all the complexities                                of Hadoop are handled by by a rabid                                 minor and this this allows a better                                 automation quicker and faster                                 development of new of new projects how                                 we do it is it's something like like                                 that rapidminer becomes like one one                                 more component within within Hadoop so                                 when we have a sign like like this one                                 with these little boxes that we call                                 operators you can see there are                                 different signs inside some represent                                 hive or a pig or spark or Mahad but in                                 the end when you draw your own workflow                                 and when you run it then rapidminer is                                 using the right technology in each case                                 to read the data prepare the data model                                 the data so that you you get the result                                 that you that you need without having to                                 worry about these all these technologies                                 and also how this technologies change in                                 time so                                                              there we incorporated the spark as soon                                 as it came now we're going to spark to                                 now we are incorporating h                                               that we see more and more often or often                                 and so on if a company needs to go in                                 this direction they need really very                                 specialized people which is not very                                 effective so what do we get well we                                 speak Hadoop so you don't have to so                                 technology is something on our side so                                 that you focus on your business needs                                 and know                                 all the investigation of the of the date                                 of the analysis of the data and then you                                 can still use your your head over script                                 so you can do everything without any                                 code but if you have your own code if                                 some of your of your users of your                                 employees still want to use for example                                 our or Python you can incorporate them                                 into our own workflows and of course                                 it's safe and sound we are very aware                                 that in corporate environment it's very                                 important security is really really                                 important so that's why we integrate                                 with with the whole security layer that                                 Hadoop has like cameras for                                 authentication or a sentry your Ranger                                 for authorization we we support HDFS                                 encryption and so on and this is a this                                 was very important for this particular                                 telco company but in general for telcos                                 or banks or or any other big companies                                 it's really something very important so                                 what's the D'Alessio of all this it's                                 that rapidminer accelerates the time to                                 value so because you can do it in a very                                 easy visual way because you can develop                                 without the need to to code in different                                 languages with different technologies                                 whenever there is a new and new idea                                 whenever there is a new a new project                                 it's very very easy to just develop it                                 and and go to production and start                                 getting the the benefits of the of the                                 projects that would be I think that the                                 main idea as a as a summary well as I                                 said development goes from months to two                                 hours in this case you can have                                 something running in even                                               everything is very very agile you can                                 get into this process of having new                                 ideas developing trying saying if that                                 works or not going back to the                                 development phase                                 and and so on and you eliminate the                                 complexities of Hadoop this is for                                 example something this quote is the one                                 I really like I almost forgot that I'm                                 using Hadoop that's our objective to                                 make head up invisible in fact                                 rapidminer has several deployment                                 options you can run your the jobs in in                                 Hadoop but you can also run them in                                 memory or in a server and both are very                                 similar that's the idea you it's it's                                 the same if you if you run it in our                                 server you write in in Hadoop it's a                                 very similar thing and it's flexible and                                 and future-proof why because we come                                 from the open source world so we have a                                 huge community more than                                                in our community working with rapidminer                                 creating new extensions giving us
