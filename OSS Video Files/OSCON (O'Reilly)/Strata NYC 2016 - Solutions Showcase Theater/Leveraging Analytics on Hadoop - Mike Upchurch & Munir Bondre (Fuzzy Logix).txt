	                              so today we want to talk about a                               multi-platform approach to analytics and                               essentially what we're going to talk                               about is how to use analytics in your                               environment using the same set of                               analytics across multiple platforms                               depending on the needs that you have                               right so just very quickly so you                               understand where we're coming from our                                background is at since                                                building analytics we started building                                them for in database we moved on to                                building them in Hadoop we have them in                                GPUs so we have a lot of experience on                                different platforms and how you use                                analytics within these platforms                                successfully obligatory customer slide                                but I think what's important to note is                                these customers using our analytics on                                many different platforms and so we've                                seen the way that they've been able to                                leverage technology in different                                environments so let's talk about your                                current and legacy challenges right your                                current challenge is at your data                                outgrew your data warehouse really                                really quickly it seems like it didn't                                happen fast but it did happen fast and                                so we think that the way to analyze the                                data that's growing within your legacy                                data warehouse system is not to pick                                that data up and move it yet to another                                environment because the bigger the data                                the bigger the problem so every time the                                data grows and you decide to move it                                that becomes more expensive so we we'd                                kind of like to advocate a solution that                                basically is to do your analytics within                                the database so I'm going to let me near                                talk about that in a little more detail                                so that the traditional sense you have                                lot of tools that people use for                                analytics like SAS are MicroStrategy or                                cognos etc where the emphasis is really                                moving the data that you want to analyze                                onto the analytics platform what we have                                done there is to install moving the data                                to the platform we are moving the actual                                analytics to the warehouse and the nice                                thing about that is that it's since                                don't move the data there's a lot you                                gain in terms of off-speed cost and you                                know the the volume that you can process                                so you can see some of the advantages on                                the left hand side here of this slide                                way we talk about faster speed it's more                                secure because you X you are now                                respecting all the access controls that                                you haven't placed in your warehouse you                                don't you know you don't have to be as                                stingy about about sampling you can go a                                little bigger than what you usually do                                of course you have the latest and the                                greatest data single source of truth and                                because you know they are actually                                managing this at the database level                                whatever access controls you have plus                                the user accounts that you have are all                                able to access these capabilities                                seamlessly here's an example of how you                                do analytics in database so what we                                really do is we you use something called                                the user-defined function infrastructure                                that most of the sequel engines provide                                and we push the analytics to process in                                database on the cluster in both process                                and data parallel manner so here's an                                example of a correlation analysis which                                if you want to do in a traditional sense                                have to move maybe ten years worth of                                data for let's say S&P                                              your analytic platform to perform the                                analysis instead you can simply file a                                query and call our function that is                                going to take the data that is being                                passed to it by the sequel engine and                                process it right where it resides and                                all you need is on the front and is a                                very light mechanism for making ODBC                                JDBC call so this is what we call in                                database analytics right and what                                happens when you do that is you go from                                these times if you look at the legacy                                tool x versus the times that you see for                                DB lytic syle just point out two                                examples the first one is in retail it's                                a                                                                   that that analysis goes to two hours                                when you shift it in database so a big                                 portion at that time was time spent not                                 moving data there were some process                                 efficiencies within the database there                                 are massive gains that you see the other                                 one is in retail where you see a                                 forecast using weather forecasts to                                 predict skew level detail for products                                 that should be on the perishable goods                                 shelf in that case you see it go from                                 five hours to                                                         just examples of why using in database                                 is a much more practical approach and a                                 much more timely and scalable approach                                 to analyzing your problems in your                                 legacy data but now we got another                                 problem is that data blew out of our                                 legacy environment and we got to turn to                                 new environments and some of those new                                 environments of course are Hadoop and so                                 that is also our current challenge where                                 you see that we're moving to an area                                 very very high data                                 I am so in this case we say well we                                 solve the problem in database for                                 traditional enterprise data warehouses                                 how do we solve the problem in Hadoop                                 and the answer is answers again in the                                 best analytics I know because in most                                 cases you'll have either one or both of                                 the environment so if you'll talk to a                                 lot of the customers today they cannot                                 just switch off their warehouses they've                                 got a traditional warehouses using                                 platforms like teradata or Netezza IBM                                 or you know sybase IQ or whatever that                                 might have been and they are moving to                                 Hadoop but it's a gradual move what we                                 pump your table is the ability to do                                 same analytics in exactly the same                                 manner on all of these platforms and so                                 you can stick with the sequel language                                 that's available to you on the                                 traditional in database and you can do                                 also in database in Hadoop currently all                                 this OP might operate on hive or even                                 spark SQL and the syntax is very similar                                 to what you watchin counter so this                                 gives you the ability to gradually move                                 your analytics from your traditional                                 warehouses to the Hadoop environment and                                 maybe use either one or both at the same                                 time so now I think we just spent two                                 sections of this explaining never move                                 the data and they're tremendous benefits                                 removing the data but there is a                                 scenario when you actually should move                                 the data and that is when you have very                                 high computational load on the analytics                                 that you're trying to do so what happens                                 is we think that there's a play for the                                 NVIDIA GPU and other types of GPUs when                                 you take a penalty for moving the data                                 it's more than made up for by the fact                                 that some of the new cards have over                                                                                                        means is when you use a GPU if you kind                                 of think about a GPU a GPU is doing                                 matrix math right for gamers it's moving                                 images around and moving pixels is                                 matrix math so it turns out these are                                 really good at extremely parallelized                                 functions and so you see some of the                                 examples Monte Carlo matrix operations                                 decision trees the speed is unstoppable                                 in a GPU this is an example of a xeon                                 eight-core environment versus one GPU                                 card and you can see up to speeds up to                                 a thousand times faster in leveraging                                 GPUs for computationally intensive                                 programs now since then that's a test of                                                                      nvidia is coming out with it with their                                 new product it's got a faster bus it's                                 got tons more memory it's got more                                 channels and it's got more cores so so                                 that would be even more dramatic so in                                 the case of doing the type of analytics                                 that are computationally intensive we                                 think that the the part of the platform                                 that you need to consider embracing                                 there is GPUs so we have a we have a                                 solution for in database and your legacy                                 platforms in your enterprise data                                 warehouse we have a solution for Hadoop                                 which we think makes sense to keep your                                 analytics within those environments we                                 have a solution that runs in GPUs but                                 coming soon is a new problem which is                                 going to be I want to do really                                 computationally heavy intense analytics                                 on a really big set of data and so in                                 our opinion traditional solutions are                                 not going to be able to solve that                                 problem so we're going to have to go                                 somewhere else and where we're going is                                 here so yeah so there's enough you can                                 already see if you walk talk to the                                 water the boots at intel and nvidia                                 there's a convergence happening where                                 the GPU technology is actually coming                                 closer and closer to the cpus which is                                 great that allows us to actually use the                                 memory much more efficiently between                                 these two technologies however there is                                 still a need to actually engineer the                                 analytics and the processing that's                                 going to happen on these gpus bottom up                                 so that they got you learn much more                                 efficiently process more data and                                 processor much faster than in the past                                 and the combination here we're talking                                 about is really having Hadoop run on GPU                                 enabled nodes so your data nodes already                                 have GPU capability on them and then the                                 algorithms that are running on those                                 nodes are actually GPU enabled for                                 efficient computation so that's they                                 really the next step that we are you                                 know working towards and I think this                                 will bring both in the best of both                                 worlds to the next generation solutions                                 in turn in analytics so so given this                                 right today if you to assemble a                                 combination of these things for big data                                 very large data computationally                                 intensive and then Big Data meets                                 computationally intensive there's a lot                                 of small sets of libraries out there                                 there's things that aren't parallelized                                 we've spent since                                                       of models that look like this and                                 include about                                                        slowly rolling out across those                                 environments and what you'll find is                                 that with these functions you're able to                                 run them across your environment using                                 the same mechanism so what that does for                                 your data scientist is it solves a                                 problem of analyzing legacy data on your                                 legacy systems solves a problem on your                                 big data system solves a problem on your                                 computationally intensive system but the                                 method of using the algorithm the                                 algorithm the scalability of it are all                                 the same across all platforms so it's                                 really also a simplification play and                                 you notice in each instance where the                                 analytics are running they're running                                 within the device or environment we've                                 moved no data to the second environment                                 except for that instance with the GPU so                                 thing is a very practical cost-effective                                 approach for you to do your analytics in                                 a multi multi platform environment                                 that's it any questions future GPU fans                                 thank you thank you
