	                              my name is Aditya Kamala and I run the                               data science marketing team over here at                               IBM analytics and today we are going to                               be talking about USA Cycling which is                               one of our one of the funnest case                               studies and it's very different from                               your regular enterprise case study that                               you would be expecting so let's jump                               right into it I'm guessing all of you                                are familiar with water cycling right                                it's a fairly basic thing but some of                                the newer things that are happening in                                this space are this advent of Technology                                advent of devices as went off internet                                of things because of which you are able                                to tap into a lot of different sources                                and able to get that data and feed that                                back to the athletes so that they can                                improve the game now goes without saying                                that coaches and athletes are absolutely                                the reason why this sports are up so                                much fun and there's so much competition                                behind it but things like technology can                                also add to that it can eat them in                                their work it can eat them in bed coming                                better athletes it can eat them in                                becoming better at their own game and                                here's a quick example of how that is                                happening this is our USA women's                                cycling team and these guys won the                                silver medal at the most recently                                concluded Olympic Games so kudos to                                these guys for doing what they've done                                now I'm guessing a lot of you are not                                familiar with what is Team Pursuit                                that's a specific bicycling game that                                these women were participating in that                                was the specific competition so let me                                give you a short video demonstration of                                what that is because that's important to                                understand what we did and how we did it                                so that hopefully the video kicks in and                                what you'll see here is as with any                                other game right speed is of essence so                                these guys are trying to climb up to                                   km/h in a matter of just a few seconds                                but you notice how very quickly they all                                fell in line behind each other right the                                whole idea there is that the first rider                                is breaking event and they're going                                against friction and making sure that                                the others are able to pass in the week                                which means that the first rider has a                                toughest job and the other subsequently                                because they're in their wake makes it a                                lot easier for them to be able to ride                                with ease and you'll see that this is                                what we call as an exchange right the                                first rider because it's a tough job                                they'll now swing to the back and the                                second rider takes the front                                and to keep doing that because the first                                rider always has the toughest job now                                these exchanges are very very minutely                                time the coach determines is exactly                                what point that needs to happen and when                                that needs to happen and how long that                                supposed to take now if you don't                                perform a good exchange that it's called                                a good exchange or a bad exchange if you                                don't perform a good exchange you can                                lose energy you can be spending more                                power and energy as as a human being to                                get in line right you don't want to do                                that you want a good exchange so they're                                obviously a lot of more lot many more                                nuances to this particular sport but in                                the interest of time I'm going to skip                                and talk about the other aspects of how                                they actually went about doing this so                                prior to us coming into the scene what                                they would do is they have these                                stopwatches right so somebody would                                manually be measuring stopwatches                                manually be measuring their time how                                long with each lap last how long did                                they exchange take how did the exchange                                actually perform and they would be                                capturing all this information believe                                in her not in an excel file oh well the                                analysis was done using excel as well                                and Excel is not real time right as                                awesome as it can be but what that does                                is it used to give them almost a                                        turnaround time to get insights back                                over to the team now try to put yourself                                in the shoes of the athlete you're doing                                training day in day out day in day out                                and you doing multiple types of training                                 very different types of training if you                                 get feedback on a particular exchange                                 that you performed two days ago like how                                 would you even remember what that                                 exchange was what you did right or what                                 you did not do right right so that's                                 where these guys were stuck and that's                                 where the challenge was because it's                                 great to get that feedback but it was                                 not timely feedback they couldn't                                 actually act upon it in the best                                 possible way so this is where we guys                                 came in what we are first thing we did                                 was develop a mobile app and that mobile                                 app was put on an android phone and we                                 put that phone underneath the bicycle                                 itself that was acting like a mini hub                                 if you will for all these devices which                                 would then put on the athletes                                 themselves so these devices were                                 capturing heart rate they were capturing                                 the power that they were using all that                                 good stuff all that information was                                 being fed to the mobile app and then the                                 mobile app itself and I don't know if                                 you guys saw this window in the short                                 video the athletes the riders they were                                 these spectacles so these spectacles are                                 not just normal secta khals they                                 actually have a connection back to our                                 the phone the phone would give them a                                 visual indication of how much power that                                 they use how much they burn all that                                 good stuff now again remember you don't                                 want to over the rider with all this                                 information right you want to keep it                                 visual you want to keep it short because                                 they need to be focused on writing so                                 that's what we were using to feed back                                 to the to the riders themselves and all                                 this information there was then sent up                                 to the cloud we're using a combination                                 of Watson IOT and Watson dataworks                                 project which is a new platform that IBM                                 just announced a couple days ago and                                 I'll speak about that in a few minutes                                 so all this information was sent up to                                 the cloud and using that information                                 there we ingested it we processed it did                                 the analytics all that good stuff and                                 sent the analysis back over on to the                                 devices themselves so these are                                 different devices one of the coaches                                 preferred an iPad so we developed an                                 ipad application somebody else preferred                                 a laptop so there was a laptop                                 application so a laptop way to access                                 the analysis and the feedback that was                                 being sent out now imagine how your life                                 as an athlete and as a coach imagine all                                 this real-time feedback that you are                                 getting the team would generally huddled                                 right after each training session and                                 they would huddle together talk through                                 the performance talk through how each of                                 the riders did and specifically web                                 other areas of improvement on what huge                                 honestly should be doing a lot more off                                 right so this kind of a instant feedback                                 really helped the team step up the                                 performance and they would all agree                                 that this was a big big deal and the                                 codes that you're seeing are from Andy                                 sparks he is the head of the USA cycling                                 team for women and we also got a lot of                                 encouragement and support and our                                 champion was Neal Henderson who's think                                 of him as an assistant coach but he's                                 also a data scientists themselves so                                 that's the kind of champions that we had                                 internally who were able to help us out                                 without this whole thing I we have a                                 couple of minutes I'll do it very short                                 demo this is really neat we'll see how                                 this one if I'm able to fit it all in so                                 this video is by the way this is just an                                 embedded video this is not there in the                                 actual dashboard but this is the                                 dashboard that they would be seen                                 and as you can see here right so you at                                 the top left corner those multiple                                 colors each color corresponds to a                                 different writer and you I don't know if                                 you can see it but there's a triangle                                 right up at the beginning that is how                                 the system is capturing and codifying a                                 bad exchange that means more power was                                 spent in that particular exchange then                                 what was optimal for that and if they                                 and the second screen up on the right                                 which is also in a blue background that                                 is showing the dotted line is showing                                 the optimal power usage and the colors                                 up at the top are showing how each of                                 the riders are performing when they were                                 at the front now you'll see in some                                 cases they were low the first case it                                 was low the second case it was high in                                 the third case it was way high right in                                 the second case it was high because they                                 were trying to compensate for the low                                 power in the first part that means they                                 weren't going fast enough in the third                                 case that's actually not a not a very                                 optimal situation right for some of the                                 riders if they try to spend too much                                 energy and they do too much it's hard                                 for them to recover and they have to go                                 multiple apps right so they can't afford                                 to do they need to stick to the optimal                                 level so in the interest of time I won't                                 go through the whole thing but that's                                 the kind of dashboard that we were able                                 to show to these guys to the coaches                                 this is Sarah hammer she is a two-time                                 Olympian and she is one of the four                                 women not just a lump in she actually                                 won gold medal sorry medals in Olympics                                 I will it's it's it really is you know                                 true what you're doing right at that                                 moment um you know especially in can                                 pursue you and appreciate you individual                                 stuff obviously can get a big benefit                                 but really in the team you can see you                                 know where that acceleration or                                 deceleration is helping or hurting so                                 yeah there you go hear from them                                 directly so what so all this is enabled                                 by Watson IOT and Watson data works                                 project right so this is our newest                                 announcement that we made we've                                 obviously working with clients on this                                 for a while to announced it just a                                 couple days ago it's a data and                                 analytics platform a first of its kind                                 in the industry and what we are really                                 essentially talking about you can just                                 big it down into three big pieces right                                 so at the bottom most are your data                                 sources right that's not even part of                                 data                                 that's what you already have your data                                 is already in multiple databases like                                 db                                                                      an application it could be anywhere so                                 all that data is being brought into this                                 common data layer which is secured which                                 has governance controls in it which has                                 auditing in it all that good stuff so we                                 call that the protected data access                                 layer and from there on the magic really                                 happens in that common data and                                 analytics processing layer that's think                                 of that as your spark your machine                                 learning your streaming applications                                 your streaming processing all that                                 amazing stuff happens in that common                                 processing layer and then you have the                                 tooling layer which is what we call as                                 experiences within IBM so for each of                                 the data and analytics personas people                                 who are actually professionals who are                                 actually using it be they be a data                                 scientist or data engineer or business                                 analyst or developers we have built a                                 custom UI for them a custom tooling for                                 them to go ahead and dip into these                                 composable micro services which are                                 offered in the bottom two layers and the                                 third layer the tooling layer is really                                 how they access a custom set of services                                 that they would be needing to do their                                 jobs that's really a that they're the                                 very basic it and if you want to try it                                 out come by our booth we are giving away                                 free raspberry PI's so you can find out                                 how you can get one of those you can try                                 one of these tools is there as well the                                 data science experience thank you so                                 much
