	                              good morning everyone my name is grant                               Bob and what I'm going to talk about                               today is where big data artificial                               intelligence and cybersecurity intersect                               what we're doing at jask and how that                               relates to some stuff that Cloudera is                               putting out there for everyone to                               advance this goal so as I said I'm grant                               um I should introduce myself a little                                bit more I started out in IT security we                                started creating custom analytics for                                insider threat as that went by we                                realized that we were limited by the                                tools by the platform by the                                possibilities that we could do certainly                                not limited by how much data was being                                thrown at us after spending some time in                                that I went back to school got my                                master's in applied mathematics and I                                came back to Intel to work on a project                                that was going to do something for the                                IT security problem that we had left                                behind what we realized is that was what                                we was missing up until this point was                                the ability to use big data in Hadoop                                with cyber security there is no shortage                                of cyber security data out there you                                have hundreds thousands tens of                                thousands of devices that are just                                spewing events and data not to mention                                just the packet stream itself but how                                all these things communicate with each                                other so all the folks out there who are                                trying to protect their network are                                already at a great disadvantage because                                all these machines are creating the data                                and because it can't all be monitored                                because it can all be looked at bad guys                                are hiding in it wherever they know that                                you have sensors they just go around it                                and so what you have to do is you have                                to be out there passively looking at                                everything that's being generated or                                network that is definitely a big data                                problem you know just have to collect                                all the data you also have to be able to                                analyze it and find the very few threats                                that are hiding in this huge amount of                                data so how do you do that you have to                                pull together a lot of different things                                you have to pull together machine                                learning that can operate at scale you                                have to put together a platform that can                                do this you also have to think of                                infrastructures that are beyond the                                typical data center like cloud                                and putting all these things together is                                not something that I T has had any                                experience with before so what we did at                                Intel data center group in conjunction                                with other vendors and other people who                                are interested in this problem is we                                created something called open network                                insight open network insight is a set of                                patterns it's a way forward out of this                                it combines Cloudera developed the                                clutter distribution of Hadoop with some                                novel machine learning algorithms with                                the UI and also tools like ipython                                notebooks things that we know out there                                are tools that we want to bring to IT                                but that IT didn't have those tools                                before things that can operate a cloud                                scale things that can distribute across                                you know from the edge all the way out                                to the cloud all these things were sort                                of blue printed and examples were put                                into open network insight because our                                goal was to show that machine learning                                and big data can work for cyber security                                and that was released it was announced                                at RSA earlier this year after some time                                it's actually been morphed into                                something that's joining apache software                                foundation it's being used at several                                customer sites by several different                                vendors and it's also a you know a                                foundation for a lot of new                                cybersecurity research now it's called                                Apache spot can announce that it                                happened just last Friday so this is a                                hot off the presses and what that allows                                oh and I to do is to move away from you                                know a purely Intel project into                                something that you know has a wider                                adoption has a longer lifespan so if                                you're interested in that and certainly                                you want to go Google's your best friend                                or beings your best friend in this case                                 and find out how you can about you know                                 either joining committing or                                 contributing to Apache spot                                 so after i was at intel and we had                                 released that i just recently joined a                                 company called jask that's what I'm                                 going to spend a little bit of time                                 talking about jask understands the cyber                                 security problems that are out there for                                 their customers what they're doing is                                 they are they also recognize it even                                 though we have a platform today that can                                 manage this data that can that can use                                 machine learning that can put this stuff                                 in front of the user they don't have the                                 users to be able to support it you're                                 going to talk to customers out there                                 they need new tools they don't have                                 budget or they can even find the                                 talented headcount to be able to go and                                 support this so the way forward we                                 believe is to start start releasing                                 tools that don't require a new analysts                                 to be hired that don't require new                                 people to support them and the way to do                                 this is with artificial intelligence so                                 right now the most difficult position                                 that is difficult to fill as a junior                                 security analyst what happens is you                                 know they have to hire somebody who has                                 no background in security at all it's                                 been a few months training them what do                                 they do they go find another job where                                 they can you know make more money it's                                 very difficult to hire and retain this                                 talent and they're very very necessary                                 for this frontline operations but I                                 don't know if there's anyone authors                                 have that job it's also a very hard job                                 there's a whole lot of alerts coming out                                 use a lot of sort of manual                                 administrative work all of that can be                                 automated first and foremost and then it                                 can be put into a deep learning format                                 something that machine learning can                                 understand and can actually react and                                 say this is a threat this is not a                                 threat or more importantly it can say                                 this is going to be a threat and that's                                 really the closest thing to the customer                                 problem today right we don't need to you                                 don't need to go tell a customer that                                 they somebody's already been in their                                 network they've been stealing data for                                 weeks I mean that's that's a nice thing                                 to know but what they really want to                                 know is okay out of these three things                                 that are happening on my network which                                 one is most likely to be                                 on this threat that it's going to be in                                 the newspaper and people are going to                                 hear about so that's really the problem                                 that we're trying to solve the jask is                                 not we don't want to tell you that                                 you've been owned we want to tell you                                 what you need to keep your eye on before                                 you get owned and that's the really nice                                 thing about being able to synthesize big                                 data machine learning and artificial                                 intelligence is you can do that so in                                 addition to the artificial intelligence                                 that we created a jazz we were also big                                 supporters to contributors the open data                                 model which is part of the apache                                 software foundation apache spot and what                                 this means to me bottom line is that you                                 know everybody can start somewhere what                                 what the real state of the art right now                                 is there some people with the dupe                                 creating their own data links there's                                 other customers who have no experience                                 in Hadoop at all and then there there                                 were some people who are very very savvy                                 they moved everything to the cloud and                                 that's the only way they do it so we                                 have to recognize that even though                                 everybody's solving specific problems                                 you know the security industry wasn't                                 built in a day you had to focus you have                                 to get good at certain things and and                                 that's the value that you provided                                 customers so we have to embrace the fact                                 that some people are going to have some                                 do-it-yourself projects there's going to                                 be some new people that creates then put                                 data into the dupe and then maybe their                                 company goes away or become some focus                                 on something different but with clutter                                 is open data model or the data model and                                 apache spot but that means everybody can                                 start somewhere people want to start                                 with log data people want to start with                                 network data people have insider threat                                 as they're burning use case that's where                                 they start but at some point if                                 everybody is using the same schema if                                 they're if they're embracing the same

they                                 can harmonize on the same data and you                                 know the no one stuck at certain                                 technology gaps or with
