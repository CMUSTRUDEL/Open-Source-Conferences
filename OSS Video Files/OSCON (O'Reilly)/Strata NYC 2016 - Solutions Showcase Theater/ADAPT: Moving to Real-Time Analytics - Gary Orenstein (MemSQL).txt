	                              hi my name is Gary ornstein I'm the                               chief marketing officer mmm sequel and                               today I want to talk to you about moving                               to real-time analytics the theme is                               adapt so we're going to get started and                               try to cover                                                          real-time analytics in                                              sequel is a database platform for                               real-time analytics and in a nutshell                                it's an in-memory but also an on disk                                database relational with full sequel                                support multi model including JSON and                                geospatial as well as distributed across                                hundreds of nodes and the goal of mem                                Siegel working with our customers is to                                help them adapt and learn in real time                                so what we're seeing today is a need to                                capture and derive insights from                                real-time data and I want to walk                                through number of different use cases to                                help you get an understanding of how                                companies are taking advantage of this                                technology every single day in the world                                of consumer products we have companies                                like kellogg's that have used real-time                                analytics to transform the way they                                handle customer logistics moving                                processes from weekly to daily and                                reducing latency from days two minutes                                they took one process from                                              to just minutes and another process the                                analytics were                                                      moving to mem sequel in the world of                                technology we have companies like Akamai                                which a global leader in content                                delivery networks deployed mem sequel to                                enhance billing speed and efficiency in                                working with their customers around the                                world this is the architecture that                                outcome I used to build their real-time                                data pipeline tracking customer traffic                                statistics in real time the results are                                millions of dollars saved and six                                million absurd per second on their                                workload mem sequel and Dell                                technologies dell has deployed mem                                sequel to enhance a customer asset                                lifecycle management system and just                                today at strada we had a daryl smith                                from emc outlining the architecture of                                their emc data lake and how they use mem                                sequel to enhance the work that they're                                doing with Hadoop to help them with                                real-time analytics in the world of                                communications and media we have                                companies like Comcast that are using                                real-time analytics to track statistics                                on their set-top boxes including channel                                changes and information on the video                                delivery so that they can                                or they're yours have a viewers have a                                positive experience so the real time                                architecture the comcast built involve                                putting data into Hadoop but also                                putting data into mem sequel for                                real-time analytics the benefit for them                                was reducing latency from                                              under a second as well as being able to                                capture hundreds of thousands of events                                per second in the world of finance we                                have companies like Novus that provides                                infrastructure for hedge funds so they                                can build real-time dashboards for their                                customers and Novus was able to                                significantly reduce the focus that                                their team had to place on ETL so they                                could focus it more on client service                                Novus moved actually from MongoDB to mem                                sequel and before a mem sequel were                                facing load times in analytics x                                   minutes we were able to get that to just                                two minutes by moving to mem sequel in                                the world of geospatial mem sequel has                                built a showcase application called

this case using an                                 architecture of going from Kafka to                                 spark in the mem sequel to deliver these                                 real-time analytics in the world of the                                 social web companies like Pinterest have                                 used mem sequel to move to real-time                                 analytics for AV testing in the past it                                 used to take as much as                                               the time that a web interaction or a                                 mobile app interaction took place and                                 we've got that with Pinterest now too                                 under a second from the time                                 that you pin or repin something on the                                 mobile app the analytics that Pinterest                                 is running we'll see that in the very                                 next query that they run the technical                                 benefits are is instant accuracy and the                                 ability to see changes in real time as                                 they're happening pinterest also used an                                 architecture that combined elements of                                 kafka spark with mem sequel to deliver                                 real-time analytics the results you know                                 moving a gigabyte of per data per second                                 and seventy two terabytes a day and                                 accelerating ingest hundreds of                                 thousands of times from the prior                                 situation which actually as mentioned                                 took                                                                 that now too under a second in the                                 energy sector mem sequel has a showcase                                 application called power stream that                                 tracks the data points from                                              turbines around the globe so in the                                 application we're capturing one to two                                 million transactions per second while                                 querying that data at the very same time                                 and providing real-time analytics to the                                 status of those wind turbines ensuring                                 that energy companies can monitor in                                 real-time what's happening with their                                 wind turbine Network and ensure that                                 those wind turbines are always operating                                 efficiently the power stream                                 architecture combines kafka as well as                                 spark and combines machine learning in                                 this case using a spark machine learning                                 library to score data as it's being                                 persisted into the database so not only                                 can you put the raw data into the                                 database but as it's going in score that                                 data so that you know if certain wind                                 turbines are in a situation of potential                                 for failure that allows the energy                                 companies to get ahead of the game and                                 make sure that their networks are                                 running efficiently and finally using                                 them sequel business intelligence so                                 tableau is a great solution there are                                 other solutions out there such as zoom                                 data and looker and MicroStrategy you                                 name it but mem sequel allows any main                                 business intelligence tool to connect to                                 the database and derive real-time                                 analytics this is just one example of an                                 application using tableau so there                                 you've got a whole bunch of wonderful                                 solution use cases about in                                 databases in real-time analytics and how                                 companies are taking advantage of this                                 technology today mem sequel is the                                 database platform for real-time                                 analytics that's powering all of these

very                                 pleased to have been given this ranking                                 by Gartner as the number one operational                                 data warehouse from a big-picture                                 perspective we see a two-step path to                                 success first and foremost we want to                                 work with

          that data both the real-time data and                                 the historical data to generate the most                                 accurate predictive analytics with                                 machine learning to help our customers                                 along this journey we've developed and                                 co authored two books in conjunction

second book which we launched                                 at the strata hadoop world show this                                 week is the path to predictive analytics                                 and machine learning and again one of                                 the key elements of mem sequel as a                                 persistent fast relational in-memory

                       only gives you a small piece of the                                 picture and using just the historical                                 data isn't going to give you the                                 accuracy of what's happening at this                                 very moment but combining those two data                                 workloads together the real time
