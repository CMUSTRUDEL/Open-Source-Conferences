	                              so what we're going to do is we're about                               to get started oh we got a clock tickin                               so let's look at how eternities platform                               leverages the enterprise tools such as                               data delivery and dated reconciliation                               as you want to make sure it's available                               you want to be able to have that                               streaming in and you want to have the                               readiness to be able to deal with                                analytics at scale to be able to have a                                platform that integrates those tools                                together and to be able to optimize the                                intelligence around what you're using                                today when you're using these                                technologies you can look at Hadoop big                                data relational stores whatever is                                inside your ecosystem at present we're                                going to be able to capture that but our                                history comes back from                                            being able to hook in mainframes and                                historical tools we have the connectors                                that we built and then we allowed you to                                replicate that data across your                                ecosystem with thousands of developers                                leveraging once we get a pattern how to                                migrate off mainframes into relational                                stores into systems whether they're in                                your data center or in the cloud itself                                what we have is about                                                                                                                        can look us up on NASDAQ our offices are                                all over the US but they're all over the                                world as well from London and Tel Aviv                                to South Africa and all the way into                                Hong Kong are three products three                                products we have the Eternity replicate                                product number one this allows you to                                integrate all these stores on the bottom                                when I talk about the platform for                                Hadoop are taking in your relational                                storage or looking at your mainframes                                and you may even note in the press                                releases as of last week we talked about                                the integration with SI p we are the                                vendor for being able to extract from sa                                p systems without affecting                                operationalized ASAP systems this gives                                us something unique the market does it                                have and this identifies us with the                                ability to have our history our history                                with being able to connect mainframes                                and the ability to integrate your entire                                ecosystem together whether it's a data                                lake or whether it's your enterprise                                data warehouse we're bringing that                                together we also have the composed                                product leveraging automation the last                                one that I'm talking about today is                                profiling your system not just profiling                                the actual metadata the cold storage the                                way people are leveraging at the hot                                storage but it's the actual use case of                                who is doing what they have data inside                                their active directory that may be                                driving                                home you know who's using this report                                how are they using it what business                                units use my data I tagged them I                                characterized it I understand the value                                of who's using what i have but also                                understanding what's inside of it is key                                so if i look at the typical enterprise                                data warehouse i look at the ways that                                i'm trying to distribute out this data                                I've got my data marts leveraging that                                data I've got my analytical systems my                                predictive analytics my forecast my                                operations but it's the dashboards that                                get distributed throughout the business                                to drive it to operationalize but in the                                in the use case of understanding how                                people are using it it's what are they                                doing and what's valuable because we                                have a lot of spendin a lot of                                opportunity to evaluate what people are                                doing with our systems we want to                                understand where the storage is being                                put into place how are they storing a                                how are they throwing it away how are                                they processing that data so who's who's                                running these queries in these low value                                situations but maybe they're not low                                value maybe they're incrementally run                                every single month but I need to know                                that that's happening and that's key and                                the ability to identify the new data                                sources that people are hooking into if                                you have an IOT use case such as the Big                                Data environment that's pulling in data                                 I'm able to source the yarn logs and                                 understand who's using what from the                                 Hadoop cluster but also understanding                                 what people are spiking what tests are                                 running one of the jobs are running and                                 the compliance and risk that gets                                 associated with that we try to resolve                                 visibility can pinpoint where inside                                 your system and who is using the data by                                 being able to pinpoint this I can                                 understand how people leverage our data                                 who's using it where they're using it                                 what is old and what am I getting to get                                 rid of also the history around this the                                 ability to drive this in from a business                                 standpoint leveraging our platform which                                 helps solution the enterprise components                                 of a Hadoop ecosystem are part of the                                 ways that you can integrate number two                                 with replicate and bringing all these                                 data sources using replicate again but                                 visibility does these things in Hadoop                                 that are unique and there's no other                                 vendor that does this this is the thing                                 to think about these three things we                                 discovered data for art from archival                                 situations you may have tables in your                                 warehouse that are no longer in use or                                 you may be keeping ten years of fact                                 data inside your                                 your enterprise data warehouse maybe you                                 could invest in this inside of a Hadoop                                 cluster and understand where these off                                 loads are being completely unused and                                 why you're actually leveraging that data                                 maybe you want to increase the nodes or                                 you want to find repetitive resource                                 seats yells that may be cached or better                                 used in resource in other directions the                                 other side of this is looking at it from                                 a holistic viewpoint no one else does                                 this we're going to take into teasy                                 Hadoop teradata Exadata sequel server                                 all these different systems are going to                                 aggregate that back to the same database                                 schema we have a large number of                                 customers across the enterprise that are                                 leveraging this data and they're trying                                 to understand let's say the use case of                                 healthcare or a bank they have petabytes                                 of storage they need to upgrade their                                 data they need to figure out how people                                 are using this the cost is pretty high                                 the ROI of what's available in what's in                                 use is something in question let us help                                 you to understand how we save them                                 millions tens of billions of dollars by                                 being able to understand the way to                                 offload that data how to restructure                                 your data architecture where things are                                 in use and where things need to be                                 reconciled and moved off this helps you                                 with compliance this helps you with risk                                 but this helps you with understanding                                 who's going to use your ecosystem so                                 here's the tool what we have are three                                 key things that we're talking about from                                 just operational metrics I want to look                                 at the way that users can look at                                 activity in my system I want to be able                                 to understand how people are using the                                 data what metrics oat month day year                                 what's the CPU time what are the service                                 levels what are the queries that people                                 are running against the system and what                                 I want to be able to do is take this                                 central repository this database that we                                 have pulling together the cataloger                                 which will look into yarn logs and clear                                 and look at how people are running their                                 MapReduce or the spark job looking for                                 the type of job whether it's a big hive                                 tez Impala spark that schema information                                 that you need to capture that goes to H                                 cat we're going to catalog that we're                                 going to collect it we're going to bring                                 that stuff together from an analyzation                                 and drop it into this database customers                                 use us to use this with the reporting                                 tool they also combine this with other                                 reports as well so it's got an                                 enterprise viewpoint that allows a                                 significant percentage of the entire                                 fortune                                                                 how their data is being put together we                                 can then populate it and we can purge                                 this for compliance reasons                                 what I'm doing is I'm collecting into hi                                 I'm pulling in this data in multiple                                 situations and as I do this I'm able to                                 understand the usage the activity and                                 the ways of people are driving this home                                 when I look at it enterprise data                                 warehouse I've got multiple systems                                 let's look at teradata let's look at who                                 do we need to understand who's doing                                 what in each and if we can do this and                                 centralize it we've got the ability to                                 bring these five tools together whether                                 it's your mainframe on db                                            going into your Hadoop cluster or you're                                 going into teasy how are people                                 leveraging their data today at present                                 let's answer that question together                                 that's significant and we all know it so                                 as we look at the things that are                                 happening we look at the servers the                                 database tables the unused portions of                                 this the way that people are writing                                 their sequel statements I aggregate this                                 up I try and collect the way that                                 informations brought together and I                                 frequently and infrequently look at the                                 unused a databases is also the unused                                 tables the unused sequel statements and                                 I collect this data what I'm doing is                                 I'm looking for the overall utilization                                 to then drive home ways that people are                                 leveraging the Hadoop cluster so let's                                 talk about a use case for how people are                                 doing this what have you ever heard of                                 hot spotting anybody talk about this in                                 HBase where some were one error log is                                 let's say the data is distributed by day                                 right and all of the errors happen in                                 one day so you're querying one specific                                 server what if you could have a tool                                 that would tell you where the problem is                                 because the distribution of data is not                                 clear because that one server gets                                 pegged a hundred times instead of                                 getting distributed with a hundred                                 threads across the hundred pools so what                                 if I could help you with your IOT I can                                 help you understand the business                                 activity and drive home the ways that                                 usage is detected and understood so we                                 also have is the ability to look at how                                 we've held Hortonworks how we've helped                                 with other customers like caldera how                                 we've helped map are a lot of these                                 Hadoop vendors themselves they rely on                                 us to help give them visibility across                                 the ecosystem not within your cluster                                 only so we're a partner to all these                                 different Hadoop vendors and help them                                 to solution their space and of itself so                                 come check us out on our website I've                                 got about                                                              to stop here but thank you for coming                                 out and our booth is right over here so                                 come stop over come check us out and                                 I'll keep talking at that point
