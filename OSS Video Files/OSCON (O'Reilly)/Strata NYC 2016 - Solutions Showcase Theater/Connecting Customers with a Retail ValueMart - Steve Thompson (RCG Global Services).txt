design our CG is a company that has been                                doing this for                                                                                                                             a big data architecture group and                                practice and big data architecture                                design implementation analytics and if                                you look at some of the leading                                publications we're actually listed as                                one of the top                                                        providers that are available this is a                                picture of our CEO Rob Simplot and he's                                basically making statement that we have                                the skills and we have the experience to                                go in and do big data implementations                                and professional services and help                                customers get to that capability of                                being able to do big data and strategy                                and we have a we have our CG a naval                                which is a line of different products                                that are available by our CG global                                services and we've been doing this since                                                                                                     days ago we were even listed as a cloud                                error validated solution and partner and                                we have a press release that was put out                                that listed our our our cg enabled data                                as a validated solution with cloudera so                                we're really happy and pleased and proud                                of that and we're at booth number                                     right here across the                                the the walkway here you can come visit                                us and we're also at the kiosk in the                                cloud era partner pavilion where would                                be more than happy to to do a live                                demonstration of our rcg enable data                                offering and also our rcg enable retail                                demo as well so r cg enable data is a                                cloud era validated data ingestion                                product that we provide is all based on                                open source and allows you to take all                                sorts of different data sources coming                                in from flat files databases coming off                                all sorts of things that you could you                                know have configured and drag-drop we                                into the Big Data cloud era a data lake                                and it is a validated data ingestion                                product and we use a lot of the cloud                                era latest technology such as kudu which                                is a high-performance database for data                                ingestion for Wii U spark spark                                streaming for real-time data ingestion                                Impala and also use AWS so we actually                                have a cloud era cluster that's running                                on the Amazon AWS and that's part of our                                demonstration to show the capabilities                                of how you could use big data on the                                cloud as well and we have some of these                                other products such as the rcg enable                                retail which is what we call our value                                Mart and that's allowing a retail type                                of industry solution to use Twitter                                feeds and use point-of-sale type of data                                we also have marketing we also have a                                hospitality smart resorts product we                                also have a health care for healthcare                                managed personalized management for                                healthcare and also finance fraud                                detection and if you go to our booth                                number                                                             arrow we could also show you as well                                demonstrations and we'd be more than                                happy to walk that walk you through                                those and we also have our CG enable                                cloud which is a cloud hosted solution                                and also our CG enable and analytics                                which is predictive analytics so you can                                use predictive analytics as a solution                                with our CG and I want to talk a little                                more about our CG enable data it is a                                 data ingestion tools i mentioned earlier                                 it uses a drag drop type of user                                 interface and you can create workflows                                 on the fly and you can also have                                 transformations from all sorts of                                 different data sources you can bring                                 those data sources into HDFS and then                                 from HTML HDFS you can go into Impala                                 you can go into kudu you can go into all                                 the other different type of technologies                                 we have a java-based execution engine                                 that is multi-threaded and also                                 distributed so fully MPP massively                                 parallel processing it actually runs                                 with a zookeeper on all the different                                 worker nodes so you can use your worker                                 nodes to help you do the math MPP                                 massively parallel data ingestion and so                                 it's fully fully parallel fully                                 distributed and it's also metadata where                                 so when you bring something in let's say                                 a CSV file or a database it actually                                 stores that metadata so it knows what                                 kind of data types that you have and and                                 all that different type of metadata and                                 keeps it with it so if you want to do                                 additional data ingestion                                 transformations or move it to other                                 different types of technologies that                                 metadata stays with it which is a really                                 powerful feature it's also a hundred                                 percent open source and if you think                                 about the data and the different data                                 systems we can bring in we can bring in                                 another Hadoop cluster we can bring                                 enterprise systems mobile databases                                 social twitter feeds web type of data                                 and then we can bring all that into a                                 data lake that is you know it's running                                 cloudera and we can bring that into all                                 different types of sources all different                                 types of targets it's really easy to                                 configure it's an XML file you just                                 configure some of the parameters and                                 when you've done that yet data source                                 shows up on the left and once again it's                                 a cloudera validated solution so we're                                 really proud of that and to be able to                                 announce that if you look at our CG                                 enable retail we call it our value Mart                                 it's really for a retail type of client                                 and you know some of the retail of                                 issues and problems that retail                                 customers may have are out of stock                                 maybe they have obsolete inventory                                 online competition maybe customer                                 sentiment they don't have any way to                                 build a measure that declining sales                                 margin erosion and so if you can use                                 Twitter feeds you can use Facebook feeds                                 and you get a lot more in touch with                                 your customers and actually drive                                 responses and interact                                 with your customers which is really huge                                 because a lot of companies don't have a                                 way to build to do that now and that                                 gives you price optimization supply                                 chain optimization brand management                                 overall store sells inventory management                                 by looking at customer histories and                                 purchasing histories and and suggesting                                 different things that they should buy or                                 maybe looking at your inventory maybe                                 you've got too much of a product and you                                 want to drop that price down and you                                 send them a coupon so r cg enable retail                                 it allows for a point-of-sale real time                                 point of cell data Internet of Things as                                 as a customer might walk by real-time                                 inventory competitive pricing it looks                                 at the cloud era Hadoop database and                                 pulls data across and reacts in                                 real-time also GPS sensor data for                                 supply chain so you can actually look at                                 gps of supply trucks see what's on the                                 truck you can actually in real time give                                 them a different target you can actually                                 drop the inventory in the truck truck as                                 they make a make deliveries to different                                 retail stores and also beacon tracking                                 and promotions as a customer would walk                                 around your store they would actually                                 get messages sent to them with coupons                                 based
