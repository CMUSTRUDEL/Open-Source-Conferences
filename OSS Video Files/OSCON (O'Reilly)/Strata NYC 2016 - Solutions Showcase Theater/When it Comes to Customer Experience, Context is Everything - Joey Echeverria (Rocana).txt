	                              my name is Joey echevarria I'm the                               platform technical lead at ro Khanna and                               I'm going to talk to you about context                               and how it relates to customer                               experience if you're in a business that                               has any kind of customer interaction you                               probably think about customer service in                               terms of human-to-human points of                               contact it may be your customer service                                reps working with someone it may be                                employees in a physical store that are                                selling to your customers but if you                                think about the way that most businesses                                are run today the experience of the                                customer starts well before they ever                                get into your store it really starts                                with your IT operational systems if                                you're an e-commerce site they're going                                to be browsing your site before you even                                know that there are customer they're                                going to be ordering online they're                                going to be experiencing how your                                shipping and tracking system works                                they're going to experience how your                                return system works if something goes                                wrong they're going to experience how                                you deal with refunds how you deal with                                customer service after the fact all of                                these touch points are governed by your                                IT operational systems they're no longer                                limited to your customer service reps                                it's not just about training people to                                be the best that they can be if they                                have a bad experience at any point in                                this life cycle with any of these pieces                                of technology you're probably going to                                lose a customer you're going to lose                                some business and what's worse is most                                of the time you don't even know that                                this has happened why is that it's                                because you lose contacts as you monitor                                data you've got these IT operational                                systems that are generating terabytes                                upon terabytes of log data and metric                                data every single day but the legacy                                monitoring tools aren't designed to do                                that they'll tell you oh just pick and                                choose the data you know what data is                                important so if you just bring the                                important data and you can ignore the                                rest or you don't really need all of                                your data you can take samples of your                                data or you can summarize your data but                                what happens is by the time that the                                data actually gets in the hands of                                stakeholders gets into your marketing                                departments hands it gets in your                                customer retention departments hands                                they've lost ninety percent of the                                context you don't actually know what's                                going on if you're summarizing the data                                before you're bringing it to these                                stakeholders they only know a piece of                                information they don't know the long                                tail they don't know the customers that                                had an exceptionally good experience or                                exceptionally bad experience they just                                see everything averaged out and the                                reality is this ten percent of the data                                is just not enough you can't get                                everything there's always things buried                                under the surface you're missing out on                                where you could be optimizing where you                                could be grabbing more customers where                                you're losing your customers all by                                dropping the data because people have                                told you that the technology doesn't                                support it or their licensing model                                doesn't support it we really think that                                there's a new approach needed for these                                IT operational systems the old approach                                you collect gigabytes maybe low numbers                                of terabytes if you're lucky retention                                is typically measured in days or weeks                                which means that you can do no                                year-over-year analysis you can't do                                long term trending you can't build                                automated models because you only have a                                week's worth of data that's not going to                                give you enough context to tell you how                                you should be performing we think that                                by leveraging Big Data technologies we                                can create a new approach to this kind                                of monitoring we can scale to petabytes                                of data of retention and petabytes of                                data of in jes we can scale to years of                                data retention you no longer have to                                pick and choose what data is most                                important to you you can afford to bring                                 it all into a single platform and we                                 also have built-in analytics because                                 just giving you a petabyte of data and                                 saying here here's a search engine go                                 search it you're probably going to be                                 lost so we've got automated analytics                                 that will take advantage of that context                                 and highlight the data that's most                                 relevant to what your mission is it's                                 going to seek through hundreds of                                 thousands of different metrics from all                                 of your operational systems from all of                                 your business systems and give you a                                 single place where you can combine those                                 metrics                                 get them and it's going to highlight the                                 ones that you want to look at so instead                                 of you having to hand pick what you're                                 looking at the system guides you to the                                 right places and this solution we call                                 rakhana ops we collect all of the data                                 we let you analyze all of the data and                                 most importantly we let you deliver that                                 data to the right stakeholders so we're                                 built on top of open source and open                                 standard technologies for a reason and                                 that's because we don't own your data                                 this data is the lifeblood of your                                 business and if you need to set up a bi                                 dashboard for your marketing team                                 against this data go ahead and do it                                 we've got everything stored in open                                 formats we use / que apache / k which is                                 an open source file format we use Kafka                                 which has open access API so you can                                 push in data and consume data so if                                 you've got data that needs to be shipped                                 from your main IT operational backbone                                 into other systems we enable that the                                 advantage is that when you bring in a                                 rakhana ops solution you can start                                 realizing savings and benefits from day                                 one because we're built on modern                                 technology we have a                                            performance improvement over legacy                                 search technologies so that means that                                 you can bring in terabytes upon                                 terabytes of data a day and actually                                 search all of it all of it is accessible                                 and the best part is that it's all the                                 historical data is is also accessible                                 you don't have to pick and choose only                                 the week's worth of hot data to search                                 you can search your entire historical                                 archive that's really important for a                                 number of use cases if you look at cyber                                 security most organizations don't                                 realize that they've been hacked for                                 about nine months after the attackers                                 originally got in that means that all of                                 the context for how did they get in what                                 are the vulnerabilities in my IT systems                                 is that data that's from nine months ago                                 if that data is either locked in cold                                 storage or even worse aged off because                                 you couldn't save it anyway you've                                 completely lost the context of that                                 attack you have no idea how they got in                                 you have no idea how to remediate for                                 future attacks                                 so you need to have that data available                                 you can also do process consolidation                                 you don't need to have a hundred                                 different tools there's a number of                                 analytics built-in and capabilities                                 built in to murkhana ops so that you can                                 start to really optimize your                                 environment for where tools add                                 additional value and the most important                                 thing is that you're enabling new use                                 cases there are new business outcomes                                 that you haven't even thought of that                                 you haven't even thought of as an IT                                 operational use case that are going to                                 drive business metrics the more that you                                 drive business metrics off your RT                                 operational data the more important that                                 I t is going to become to the way that                                 you run your business so really it comes                                 down to context is everything you need                                 to see the entire picture you can't just                                 live with ten percent solutions you need                                 hundred percent solutions in order to                                 get the job done now that we've got some                                 time for questions if anyone's                                 interested                                 all right thank you very much
