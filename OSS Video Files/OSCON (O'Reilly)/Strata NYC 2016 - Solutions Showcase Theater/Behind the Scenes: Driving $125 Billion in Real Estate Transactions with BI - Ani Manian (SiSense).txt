	                              thanks for joining me live from strata                               Hadoop I'm here talking about one of our                               most interesting use cases so sigh sense                               the company I represent simplifies                               business analytics for complex data and                               what we do is we we make be I work for                               you rather than the other way around so                               for too long this industry has been                               plagued by technology that makes a jump                                through hoops so I want to show you a                                quick example of when it goes quite the                                other way around so I'd like to tell you                                today about one of our clients Mr is                                which is probably one of the biggest                                companies you've never heard of so these                                guys drive a hundred and twenty five                                billion dollars in real-estate                                transactions and underneath all this is                                the science data engine so let's take a                                quick look at mr is so they're one of                                the biggest mls providers in the country                                they've been around for decades and                                they've essentially processed over                                    billion dollars in transactions they                                serve almost                                                   professionals and they have two sides of                                their business they serve both owners of                                properties who'd like to sell their                                assets as well as real estate                                professionals and brokers and dealers                                who are trying to sort of facilitate                                these deals now these guys are very                                advanced on their back end right they                                have a really fast agile con man team                                they have a fully automated battery of                                tests are numbering in thousands and                                they deliver the interfaces across web                                and mobile devices now these guys serve                                a lot of people almost                                                  they sit on on average about six million                                public records with                                                    an average year-to-date sales volume of                                forty billion dollars these numbers are                                really nothing to scoff about especially                                they've driven a total volume of                                    trillion dollars in listing so you can                                only                                in the amount of data that's sitting                                behind all this that needs to be made                                sense now all that data hundreds of                                billions of trillions of dollars of data                                is represented in these slick web and                                mobile interfaces all written on                                angularjs now let's talk about how mrs                                actually got here so their journey with                                bi is actually quite recent even though                                they've been sitting on a lot of data                                and the company was very data driven on                                the backend not much of this was                                actually surfaced out to the clients so                                they started with their first bi                                initiative ever and remember that this                                industry real estate has been                                historically starved of any technology                                all of records have been maintained on                                in like journals and Diaries sometimes                                Excel files it's very antiquated most                                contact happens over cellular phones                                over text messages emails none of this                                is centralized and it's really hard to                                get a sense of both as a renter as an                                owner as a broker what's really going                                around around you and get a comparative                                sense of how your listings are doing in                                the marketplace so what mrs wanted to do                                was serve both business units with a                                single initiative which is smart and                                they wanted to use bi both for internal                                use to understand how the business is                                doing growing expanding and operating as                                well as embed these analytics for their                                end users so they could understand                                better and manage their properties so                                real estate agents could manage their                                business their clients and really                                optimize everything for the first time                                now they were collecting data from                                dozens of sources hundreds of millions                                of rows per table serving almost four                                million API calls a day and they wanted                                a tool that worked for them remember                                their team was agile they worked on a                                con man fashion taking tickets and                                churning out features on a week by week                                basis and they wanted some                                thing that would keep pace with them                                so let's talk about why mrs choice I                                sense there's three main reasons so one                                of the first reasons is customer support                                 so for any company that's looking for to                                 embed analytics in their products and                                 serve them to their end users customer                                 support is probably the most important                                 thing not the reasons why a company                                 embeds analytics instead of building                                 this in-house is because most companies                                 want to keep their development team                                 focused on their core competencies in                                 this case it was serving up really great                                 insights and metrics around real estate                                 mrs wasn't in the business of making                                 bi-products nor should they be mrs also                                 didn't want to spend a long time taking                                 this this embedded analytic solution out                                 to market they wanted to get there                                 really quick in a matter of weeks if not                                 months the second reason why most                                 companies choose embedded BI solutions                                 is because of analytic the ability to                                 actually customize a solution down to                                 their needs now if you look at the                                 previous slide this solution is branded                                 exactly according to mrs s design                                 guidelines exactly how they like the end                                 customer has no idea that there's                                 another bi system that's serving all                                 this up the third reason why mrs choice                                 i sense was because they wanted a tool                                 that kept pace with their continuous                                 delivery model so mr is releases                                 features on a regular basis week by week                                 these features are tested through a                                 suite of automated tests as soon as they                                 pass their delivered right to their                                 customers now anything that actually                                 slows this down is completely                                 unacceptable so for these three reasons                                 mrs searched across the landscape for a                                 bi tool that would actually allow them                                 to use the solution both internally and                                 externally keep pace with them offer                                 unbelievable customer support as well as                                 allow them to customize it down to the                                 exact needs now their customer journey                                 with size ends and this is                                 representative of most customers that                                 partner with us is actually quite                                 interesting now bi as an industry enjoys                                 the lowest adoption rates in almost any                                 enterprise software and the reason for                                 this is it takes a lot of time to                                 actually get all this out it's very                                 complex and often companies spend weeks                                 months years sometimes wrestling with                                 the intricacies of deploying these                                 solutions now what science does                                 differently is that we create an                                 onboarding process for every client and                                 we guarantee that every single client                                 walks out of the onboarding process with                                 a finished solution by deploying these                                 and launching these solutions very very                                 soon after a contract is written up what                                 happens is that these tools are actually                                 adopted very rapidly and customers are                                 actually able to enjoy the benefits much                                 much much sooner on the order of weeks                                 if not months let's talk about some                                 interesting aspects of Mrs S                                 implementation now what mrs did was                                 develop an angularjs front-end that                                 consumed what is no jackal which is a                                 query language that decisons back-end                                 execute and provides to the end users so                                 mrs is actually using science as a query                                 execution framework and the reason for                                 this is science has a proprietary                                 technology called in chip this is able                                 actually deliver                                                       comparable solutions and it actually                                 made no sense for mrs to be crunching                                 their own data so sighs sense on the                                 backend generates all the information                                 that mrs needs to serve up the                                 dashboards the metrics the charts and                                 the visualizations on their web and                                 mobile phones now jackal is a functional                                 data processing language that's commonly                                 used for json which is JavaScript object                                 notation which is the easiest way for                                 modern user interfaces                                 to actually consume information now                                 remember the reason why all this is                                 possible is because the proprietary in                                 ship technology enables size ends to                                 handle                                                                than comparable tools and the main                                 reason for this is that science is able                                 to actually leverage the central                                 processing unit the CPUs level                                           level                                                                fast especially compared to the memory                                 as well as the hard drives that most BI                                 solutions use one of the more                                 interesting things we've done in recent                                 time is actually use the power of this                                 integrated full stack bi offering                                 coupled with the in chip analytics that                                 allow you to process a lot of data                                 really really fast to deliver insights                                 outside the confines of a                                 two-dimensional screen now most bi when                                 when people think of the word bi they                                 think of dashboards and they think of                                 widgets they think of information being                                 locked on screens and what we wanted to                                 do was something radical we wanted to                                 obsolete our own dashboards so what we                                 did was we connected these tools to IOT                                 devices namely a lamp and a science                                 enabled amazon echo what mr is is                                 considering doing is actually putting an                                 amazon echo on every real estate agents                                 desk so they can actually talk to that                                 data they can ask how many outstanding                                 listings do i have today how many                                 appointments do i have today what is the                                 total square footage i'm looking to move                                 the size in this lamp is very                                 interesting as well because for the                                 first time in the history of BI it                                 breaks the one-to-one interaction model                                 that a dashboard creates a dashboard can                                 only be used by one person at a time you                                 can project it on the screen but no one                                 really looks at that what a light does                                 what a lamp does is it allows you to                                 galvanize a team in this case an entire                                 office full of brokers by showing them a                                 lamp I look a color that corresponds                                 with their most important KPI which is                                 anything that they choose it could be                                 total listings that they need to move it                                 could be their quota for the day it                                 could be a certain number of meetings                                 they need to hit now a lamp has the                                 power to actually use ambient insights                                 to keep you on task and keep you focused                                 and align with your metrics without                                 changing a single thing so the                                 combination of these two is our effort                                 to actually use innate human tendencies                                 to influence how we work and how we                                 motivate ourselves to get closer and                                 closer to our goals if not exceed them                                 so to summarize our goal at size ins has                                 been to help businesses maintain focus                                 gain constant visibility and ultimately                                 make data different decisions any                                 questions that I can take from the                                 audience thank you
