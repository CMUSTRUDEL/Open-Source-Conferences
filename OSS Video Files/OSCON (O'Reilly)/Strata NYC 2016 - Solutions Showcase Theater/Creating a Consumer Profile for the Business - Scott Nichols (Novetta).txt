	                              hello well thank you guys for coming                               today I'm Scott Nichols and I'm with                               Nevada I am the product owner of our                               Nevada nad oolitic product and today I                               want to talk to you guys about building                               a consumer profile today I'm going to                               focus on the business side and then                               tomorrow I'll coming back and talking                               more from the technical side so the                                first question is what is a consumer                                profile and really what we're talking                                about with the consumer profile is                                building a strong foundation a                                    degree view of your data so if you have                                many different disparate data sets                                bringing those data sets together and                                finding the same real world entity                                across all of those data sets in one                                shot the use case that we're talking                                about here was for a financial services                                company where we basically took                                         different data sets that they had and                                trying to build a very good foundational                                view of that data in addition to                                including just the profile to CRM data                                also bringing in the transactional data                                they had upwards of                                                   trying to bring in all that data for                                analysis as well as relationships and                                build relationships out of that as well                                some of the things that help with                                building a consumer profile is really                                trying to make it flexible to new data                                sets so some people say this is kind of                                like mastering data or master data                                management but where we differentiate                                ourselves a little bit is trying to make                                that very flexible to to the different                                needs that a customer might have if                                they're adding new data sources every                                day being able to accommodate that as                                well as be able to build it at scale                                when the business case changes so some                                of our use cases would change on a daily                                or weekly basis and being able to change                                the resolution and run very quickly is a                                foundational thing and being able to do                                other kinds of entities not just persons                                or organizations or businesses but being                                able to model you know a parts if it's a                                manufacturing company or other kinds of                                entity types as well and being able to                                bring all that different data together                                into one shop natively on Hadoop and all                                the while trying to keep track of the                                different data governance and security                                concerns that people have right so not                                pulling that data back to the edge node                                to process keeping it out on the Hadoop                                cluster key                                track of things as well is all part of                                building a consumer profile our software                                and what we did in this use case was                                basically taking all the different data                                sets that came in to us and building a                                unified picture of an individual and so                                you can see here just a snapshot from                                our software that shows how we were able                                to build kind of a unified picture of                                this Liana Freeman person across                                multiple data sets and so you can see                                how some of the nodes in that graph                                would be linked together based on exact                                name or exact name and address as well                                as as fuzzier logic as well so our                                software is very flexible when it comes                                to fuzziness right so there's                                         different blocking and scoring functions                                that's been built into the software and                                really what we're finding from all the                                customers that we work with is trying to                                do that in a nice consolidate way and                                allow the customers to tell that                                flexibility on their own is very very                                important and so with the consumer                                profiles some of the things that we're                                finding that that's been a value in this                                use case from a business perspective is                                really helping the company's focus on                                more the analytics and the value add                                functions and less on the data                                preparation they say that right now a                                lot of data scientists are spending                                sixty seventy percent of their time                                doing data preparation that's what they                                do is trying to get the data in a state                                that they can actually do the analytics                                on that data and so one of the things                                with with what we did for this company                                 was being able to make it so that they                                 can spend less at that time doing data                                 preparation and more of it actually                                 doing the analytics that they need to do                                 so it improves efficiency that way                                 improving consistency so being able to                                 standardize those organiz analytics                                 across the organization in this                                 particular use case we were dealing with                                 a organization about                                               analysts and they were each doing their                                 own little thing and then their silos                                 and so being able to make that                                 consistent and allow the organization to                                 build on the fact that John over here                                 had a really cool analytics versus Susan                                 over here who had a different                                 was a very powerful thing in this case                                 and being able to do that all while                                 meeting all the security requirements                                 and all the governance requirements is                                 is huge right keeping that data out on                                 the high on the Hadoop cluster                                 processing it out there instead of                                 bringing it back to the application                                 doing appropriate logging as well as                                 different access controls and meeting                                 the de standards that most do preventers                                 and most companies provide as well and                                 then the last thing there is really                                 about trying to add that flexible                                 control right so not forcing people to                                 just one way and that's the only way                                 that you'll ever resolve your data or                                 bring it together that you can actually                                 change those rules and run again on the                                 fly if you need to is is very important                                 and it allows businesses to change those                                 rules and meet their different use cases                                 as they need to write so in this                                 particular use case again when you're                                 doing with                                                             different jobs or different use cases                                 they're working for they're going to                                 resolve that data slightly differently                                 for one question versus a second                                 question right and so being able to                                 provide a nice consistent way that still                                 meets all the requirements from a                                 security point of view but give them                                 that flexibility is a very very powerful                                 thing and it was able to easily model                                 other types of entities right so in this                                 case we also had some consumer profiles                                 for things like cell phones so for                                 example being able to take the different                                 cell phone transactions that are in the                                 data in different data sources and be                                 able to resolve on that and it linked                                 that to the people and the organizations                                 as well and being able to do that on                                 locations and addresses as well as well                                 as other types of entities right we have                                 some cases where it's in the                                 manufacturing space and so it's dealing                                 with parts and well data other places                                 it's more for the fraud detection and                                 risk assessment aspect as well and so                                 trying to give companies that                                 competitive advantage to stay above                                 their competition is really where being                                 able to build a consumer profile being                                 able to build that cohesive view that                                 entity view of your data has really                                 proven                                 great for Nevada and for the companies                                 that we work with and all of our                                 software runs natively on Hadoop and                                 keeps all the data out on the Hadoop                                 cluster and processes it out there to                                 make sure that we're not pulling you                                 know                                                                     an edge node and processing there or                                 anything as well so in a nutshell that's                                 that's basically the business side of                                 things tomorrow I'm going to talk again                                 and I'll be presenting a much more of                                 the technical side of things and not so                                 much on the business side so I'm hoping                                 that you'll come out and join me in                                 really tomorrow we're going to dive a                                 lot into the Hadoop architecture of one                                 of these things and what it looks like                                 what are the jobs actually look like                                 they were running for for doing building                                 a consumer profile what do you know how                                 does the flexibility actually function
