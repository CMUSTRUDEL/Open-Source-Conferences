	                              alright thank you for joining me now                               we're going to talk a little bit about                               to the cloud and back talking about how                               do you move data mobility for analytics                               and as you probably saw in the keynotes                               this morning if you were in there the                               cloud appears to come up in at least                                  times in every talk luckily there was no                               drinking games or people be drunk so                                from that standpoint you know one of the                                big questions are everybody's got all                                sorts of infrastructures but they're on                                premise what do you do with moving your                                data up to the cloud how do you actually                                get it to the cloud or does it generate                                in the cloud and those are questions I                                think of you song keynotes and a lot of                                customers i talk about struggle with                                what are you going to do how you going                                to get it there and so you know a lot of                                different traditional architectures you                                know if you have cloud native                                applications the data is actually there                                but if you have data center where you're                                trying to solve say cyber security                                you're trying to do with potentially                                Internet of Things type of data sensor                                data any type of data that's coming off                                of anything physical it's probably not                                originating a cloud so how are you                                getting it up there and so what we're                                spending a lot of time worried about is                                how do we focus on helping modernity and                                in our case from an EMC del MC                                perspective we've been focused on                                helping you empower your data center for                                a long time now we're trying to figure                                out how do we help you move data as a                                data mobility angle wherever you want it                                to be wherever the analytics is going to                                go if your analytics are in the cloud if                                your analytics are on another premise                                not your current data center maybe a                                backup data center how are you moving                                the data across all of the angles and                                specifically if you're taking it to the                                cloud how you bring it back now why                                would we care about this so it leads an                                interesting scenario probably not a                                shock if you saw some of the discussions                                here today that spending on the cloud is                                basically four and a half times greater                                than on-prem spend that's probably not a                                shock to anybody that's sitting looking                                at the trends we're seeing here today                                it's also predicted that data analytics                                by                                                                    sitting here at strada that's probably                                not a shocker either and so from that                                standpoint what we're starting to see a                                lot of conversations are or what I call                                hybrid                                linux I want to do some on-premise                                analytics I want to do some cloud                                analytics and how do I figure out how to                                marry the data between them move it up                                do the analytics bring it back that's                                what we mean by date of mobility how do                                you move it around to where you need it                                because everybody's probably heard of                                the term data gravity where you put the                                data as where it's probably going to be                                the larger the data the harder it is to                                move and so depending on where you're                                going to move that data around will                                dictate where you've actually can do                                your analytics so the harder it is to                                move the harder it is to do your                                analytics somewhere else and so that's a                                challenge that we're spending a lot of                                time focused on more specifically you                                know how do you get it back so a lot of                                people talk about moving the data into                                the cloud once you've done a series of                                analytics what data do you want to bring                                back and that's where we're seeing a lot                                of a challenge is people don't                                necessarily understand that sometimes                                they want to bring the data back and so                                from that standpoint they've got a                                really good plan for getting it in there                                getting it out as far more expensive                                than putting it in if anybody's ever                                looked at the cost models and so that's                                what we're spending a lot of time                                working with our partnerships figure out                                how do we get the data up how do we                                bring it back how do we help you move it                                around all of your premise because that                                 to us is the workload that's untapped                                 which is how do you empower the business                                 that really is outcomes not moving data                                 not standing up a dupe how do you build                                 an outcome-based where you can actually                                 use the data to change your business and                                 that's what drives behavior changing you                                 know what you do to drive your business                                 is really the reason you stand up ado                                 the reason you move the data the reason                                 why you're at strata calm and so that's                                 where we're spending a lot of time                                 talking and focus about it and so from                                 our standpoint you know where we spent a                                 lot of time is hat Delhi MC spent a lot                                 of time replicating your data building                                 redundant copies backing up your data so                                 as we talked about it moving it to the                                 cloud is yet another just move for the                                 data so we're working on how do we                                 enable those types of scenarios                                 how do we empower that or it could be                                 you want for data centers one on each                                 continent you may not want to move to                                 the cloud for single tendency issues you                                 regulatory you know governmental you'd                                 rather just have them in different data                                 centers how do you move active active                                 Hadoop across multiple continents and so                                 that's where it gets to be rather                                 entertaining because trying to actually                                 do Hadoop on multiple continents and                                 keep the data refreshed around the                                 continents is not an easy challenge and                                 so that's where we're spending a lot of                                 time focused on how do we enable that                                 how do you move forward to provision                                 different instances and hydrate the data                                 on all those instances and so from that                                 standpoint you know we're just starting                                 to do a little bit of explaining how                                 we're getting there what are we're                                 focusing on why are we interested in it                                 because we firmly believe that the cloud                                 isn't going away that hybrid analytics                                 aren't going away and that migration of                                 data is the key and so from that                                 standpoint you know as we start to talk                                 to clients about what they're doing                                 really it's adding how do you do it                                 without manually scripting how do you                                 not have to have someone manually script                                 the file to move the data up and bring                                 it back how can you do a policy based so                                 if when I mean by policy based it'll do                                 it based on time based on when is                                 generated based on which directory it's                                 in how does it just move the data back                                 based on a rule migrated it of wherever                                 you want based on that and that will                                 allow you to leverage some of the                                 different analytic components across                                 your entire infrastructure and so as we                                 start to wind down I'll take any                                 questions you have how is it that we can                                 enable your cloud-based technologies for                                 analytics and be able to move your data                                 everywhere you need it thank you
