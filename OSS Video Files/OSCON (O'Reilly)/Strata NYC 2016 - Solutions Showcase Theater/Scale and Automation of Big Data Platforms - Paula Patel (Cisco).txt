	                              good afternoon everybody thank you so                               much for joining today I am Paula Patel                               I am part of the cisco unified computing                               systems group here to talk about cisco                               ucs platforms for data-intensive                               applications so let me start with the                               background here as you know you guys are                               all more familiar with this industry                               with big data the growth of big data has                                all taken us by surprise the need for so                                much more storage and compute is coming                                up with real-time analytics it's all to                                basically run generate revenue for all                                of us and starts with the growth of IOT                                platforms and data coming in from                                multiple sources including people like                                you and me who are overall generating                                more data than we did for a few years                                back average data by                                                    five terabytes per person so given this                                complete era that we are in digital                                disruption is it both for Cisco calls it                                we looked at what are the technologies                                that are key to be successful from a                                platform perspective in this industry                                and therefore we looked at five areas                                performance is going to be really                                important when it comes to real-time                                analytics providing data when you need                                it providing analysis of data when you                                need it with so much data storage                                capacities and that relates to the next                                point management of this compute and                                storage is becoming a key factor into                                what the Big Data industry is looking                                for and at scale right it's no more                                about traditional data which kind of                                maxed out at                                                        talking petabytes of data and to scale                                to that level with a simplified                                management structure is going to                                becoming really important and add a real                                a good total cost of ownership so having                                said that this is a platform                                requirements that we were given when we                                build you see us by some of the top                                customers who were looking at Big E Big                                Data you see as deployment so Big Data                                deployments so when we build a cisco                                unified compute platform which is our                                platform for big data                                few things came to mind right there's so                                much amount of compute and storage you                                need here it's going to it needs a very                                simplified network there is different                                components of the network switching                                storage compute can we look at data                                center what can we simplify first thing                                we said is cables there are so many                                cables that break over time that's what                                we fixed in the unified computing                                platform we have a single wire for land                                sand and management and therefore you                                have one wire doing three different                                things simplifying architecture                                deployments here it comes back to                                scaling right if you're looking at                                scaling thousands of the servers this                                completely simplifies your number of                                cables needed into the infrastructure                                number of touch points needed into this                                infrastructure and the other big thing                                we did is we build out a simplified                                architecture based on what we call                                service profiles it's very analog is                                from a management perspective to your                                simcard management right you put in a                                server it automatically registered                                itself within the network and it is                                completely available from a management                                perspective for you to deploy solutions                                on it in the past you would wait for a                                couple of days for a sysadmin to give                                you network addresses to give you where                                to put in racking places and all of that                                up here we just get a server or you can                                pre buy servers but turn them on as                                needed into the management structure so                                it's a single view form a management                                perspective for compute and also it goes                                back to storage and networking side of                                things and all this relates into a                                higher performance from our inception                                we've looked at giving a the best top of                                line processors top of line memory but                                also from a networking perspective right                                                                                                platforms today so between all this and                                then our scalability our management                                 happens at a network layer it's not                                 about managing a server that manages                                 other servers it's about coming down                                 from the network all the compute and                                 storage infrastructure that sits within                                 that domain                                 is managed through the network piece                                 that comes into the systems so that's                                 what the cisco unified computing systems                                 is basically it's about a simplified                                 architecture unified management higher                                 performance and scale and how do we do                                 this let me just take a step into deep                                 diving into the technology itself here                                 I'm showing one server that connects to                                 what we call our fabric interconnect the                                 fabric interconnect is where the                                 management resides now this fabric                                 interconnect today is                                                                                                                           at least hundred and sixty servers on                                 this domain and the computer that we are                                 showing there is a single pane of                                 management that you connect into your                                 fabric interconnect then manages all the                                 compute infrastructure and also storage                                 infrastructure that sits within this                                 fabric interconnect simplifying one                                 single view for the customer                                             within the domain and this experience                                 how to a central global view of multiple                                 units and you can deploy services on any                                 of these compute farms where as you like                                 them or you can automate the deployment                                 of complete forms that you know                                 overnight tasks that require less                                 compute can be deployed on lower                                 processors vs higher processors and you                                 can move this around it's completely                                 automated basically and that's what UCS                                 management is about it's managing                                 compute and storage that fits within the                                 domain in a simplified management                                 structure and with this we've taken a                                 next level at big data deployments in                                 the when I say next level of big data                                 deployments we have a cisco integrated                                 infrastructure which is basically                                 partnered with top EAJA sui's in the                                 space including Cloudera and others                                 where we have pre-tested and pre                                 validated design what this means is                                 cisco support knows when you call them                                 that this is a cloud error deployment                                 they have debugged it and it's a pre                                 validated pre-tested configuration                                 and it's on man it through fabric                                 interconnect and we have different                                 levels of management that simplifies the                                 managing of servers i mentioned UCS                                 manager which is our top one year which                                 does automation of provisioning                                 monitoring maintenance and growth as you                                 add in more servers at the next level we                                 have you see a central which does                                 multiple of these UCS managers and you                                 can deploy global service profiles if                                 your servers in San Francisco go down                                 you can have a backup server running in                                 Tokyo and that picks up by a ucs central                                 and that's all part of the automation                                 that's build around UCS management and                                 then the UCS director takes you to the                                 next level where it also manages other                                 pieces of the data center we completely                                 know that there are other pieces in the                                 data center including storage and                                 compute so UCS director basically gives                                 you a single pane of glass looking into                                 this and that for a big data                                 optimization we have worked through with                                 different big data vendors to basically                                 offer centralized visibility into Hadoop                                 and physical infrastructures so from a                                 hardware / / hardware integrated                                 platform for ucs what we've done is                                 we've optimal out some portfolio of                                 products that are specifically for big                                 data we start with our lowest one are                                 you it's our most high-performance from                                 a caching layer perspective going all                                 the way up to a newly formed product                                 which is called the                                                                                                                          half a petabyte of storage so as you                                 grow your big data needs you can expand                                 into different capacity versus compute                                 compute versus capacity ratios with the                                 whole Cisco UCS product portfolio one                                 thing i would like to definitely touch                                 on i talked about the                                                   what's unique about it in the industry                                 it's a modular chassis means it will not                                 refresh as intel compute refreshes this                                 chassis is on a second generation of                                 intel products and you can qualify it at                                 a chassis level within your                                 infrastructure and you do not move                                 to as intel refreshes but still keep                                 adding more cores and more compute to                                 the same capacity the capacity of this                                 is alpha betta bite of storage today so                                 this is UCS platform we have integrated                                 solutions available with all our                                 products and is three solutions and to                                 wrap it up here we are this other                                 results produced by IDC we have three                                 hundred and sixty-six percent of ROI on                                 the big data deployment using cisco ucs                                 integrated infrastructure thank you so                                 much for your time
