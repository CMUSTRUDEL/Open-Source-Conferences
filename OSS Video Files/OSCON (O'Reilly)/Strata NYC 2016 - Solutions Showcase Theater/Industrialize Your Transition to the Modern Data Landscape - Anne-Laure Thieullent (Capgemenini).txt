	                              thank you very much my name is and love                               to know I'm part of capgemini insights                               and data I'm heading or big data                               practice for Europe and I'm also in                               charge of developing or solutions that                               we package and develop for our clients                               to move faster to big data so I know if                               you guys have followed the news on                               SpaceX these days it looks like we're                                getting closer to the idea to actually                                colonizing Mars hopefully not dying in                                the process well for some of our clients                                I have to say moving to big data                                sometimes it's as terrifying as moving                                to Mars basically so why is that well                                since                                                                 of business intelligence our client I've                                built a lot of data warehouses a lot of                                data Mart's a lot of bi reports and what                                happened is that since the legacy                                technologies are not so easy to evolve                                and sometimes run into performance                                issues basically each time business                                users have a new question or a new                                requirement or clients ended up building                                a new system to do that so fast forward                                                                                                       and the Big Data revolution this                                spaghetti architecture that you're                                seeing on the left is becoming a                                freaking nightmare to manage and to                                evolve so basically our clients are                                ending up with dozens of data our house                                that they crank that they cannot make                                evolve fast enough for business                                requirements hundreds of data model and                                thousands of bi reports and that is not                                satisfying to a four-cell business                                requirements right now they want to move                                to the next generation approach that is                                powered by big data data science                                analytics as a service they want to put                                data at the center of everything they do                                and they want to basically stop                                considering a bi as a nice to have and                                something that is on the side of                                operations but really put data at the                                center of everything no better the                                clients optimize their business                                processes and all of that for a cheaper                                cost because the data sites are getting                                bigger and more complex every year but                                the question is how do I move from the                                left                                the old world to the right and to the                                new world that's exactly what happened                                with one of our clients in europe with                                european government agency we are                                building for them their enterprise data                                hub on top of cloud and on top of                                putting that at the center of their                                operations and using that as basically                                the source provider for all of their                                digital channels they asked us to read                                platform tens of the tower houses                                hundreds of data Mart's of SAS models                                and thousands of bi reports and all of                                that in a very aggressive planning                                because really when you're dealing with                                those new needs around data you can't                                spend five years redoing what you used                                to do on the old system on top of the                                new system so a big objective was around                                to see you optimization of course so                                stop having you know licenses and                                databases and redundancy all over the                                place and REE platform that on top of                                the new system the challenge that we                                looked at is that basically those data                                our houses have sometimes                                            old of age they are unmanaged sometimes                                there are not sure basically what is                                exactly used what are the business users                                that what they are doing with this etc                                etc so there is a high risk of                                functional regression when you put that                                on top of the new platform we also                                looked at previous experiences that we                                that we seen that clients wanting to do                                technical migrations from say one                                database to another folded our house or                                replat forming from VI two new data                                platforms and we looked at the pitfalls                                so basically we could end up migrating                                assets that aren't used anymore just in                                case because you never know because your                                business users will oh well tell you I                                need to have everything on the new                                system period but that's all waste of                                 time is if it's not used you can also                                 run into issues when those applications                                 on the documented or if they are not                                 completely managed so basically the two                                 options that you have is to go look at                                 the code or go interview business users                                 that are actually using                                 Asset probably you will progressively                                 discover that there's no real such thing                                 as a technical migration and you will                                 need to rebuild completely part of the                                 estate and even in the worst cases you                                 will discover that you have these                                 equality issues in the old system and                                 you will discover that maybe the KPIs                                 and the numbers that are reporting to                                 the world has been false since yours                                 it's going to be improved in the new                                 platform but it will be different and                                 you fast for what n months your business                                 users will not have a complete trust in                                 the new platform they will want to keep                                 the old systems just in case and                                 basically if you end up maintaining the                                 two systems during a long time forget                                 about tcu optimization and forget about                                 the business users happiness so it                                 really does sound bad so what we built                                 in order to solve that issue for our                                 clients is a framework that will                                 industrialize the end-to-end process to                                 replat from VI and it our house                                 applications on top of next generation                                 platforms in that case it was used to                                 move those tended our houses on top of                                 cloud and enterprise data hub you see on                                 the left two different modules that we                                 have built it covers the end to end life                                 cycle of a replat forming project so not                                 only for example simple translation or                                 meta data management that really all the                                 faces that you have to go through in                                 order to read platform bi and there are                                 house applications to a new platform so                                 first estimating the transformation                                 effort with diligent we can assess and                                 tell you what other parts of the bi                                 reports what all the parts of the                                 existing data our houses that are not                                 used anymore so that you can have a                                 fact-based approach to prove to the                                 business users that is not used anymore                                 and help that out of the scope of the                                 migration we have built also a design                                 and build accelerators so that you can                                 detect automatically what all the                                 technical and functional overlaps                                 between those different data warehouse                                 and those different Bo universes and                                 reports for example if you have a client                                 table that has been replicated over and                                 over again around all the data our house                                 you can detect that even though the                                 table names and table columns are not                                 all the same and you can go all the way                                 up until optimizing the testing for your                                 big data project so we have started to                                 implement that in a first scope of the                                 migration project at all client we were                                 able to reduce the scope of the project                                 of forty percent and also to bring a                                 productivity efficiency the fifty                                 percent during the build and the test                                 phase and it's really about basically                                 saving thousands of men days of work in                                 that process we have built it on top of                                 cloud enterprise data hub but it's                                 adaptable also to other tools and other                                 stacks its client proven so we have                                 really built it out of a real project so                                 not you know a slab initiative it's part                                 not satisfied by cloudera and we are                                 going to improve the features of the                                 product from one implementation to                                 another so I'm going to keep that so                                 which broader client issues are                                 resolving so I talked about you know our                                 clients a little losing control over                                 their bi landscape not really knowing                                 what is used or not not really no sure                                 that they are not going to build yet                                 another system that is not going to                                 fulfill a hundred percent of the                                 business requirements and maybe                                 ultimately not build the data link but                                 all the data swamp well basically unless                                 you're telling me that you                                            happy with your bi system
