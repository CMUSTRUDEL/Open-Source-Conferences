	                              we're going to be talking about                               transcending time and space using                               streaming analytics and what that means                               is been able to do calculations that                               involve time calculations that involve                               space and also to expand what you do for                               analytics throughout the enterprise                               cloud and IOT so everyone here has seen                               this over the last few years the data                                landscape is changing the data that                                we're dealing with years ago it came                                from humans typing stuff then it started                                to come from machines which produce logs                                that went into big data and now it's                                coming from millions and billions of                                devices and where this processing is                                happening is changing as well it was                                unpromising throughout the cloud and                                into hybrid cloud models and where                                applications used to be able to do                                analytics and do them slowly with very                                high latency maybe end of day now people                                are expecting low latency instant                                gratification instant response for all                                of their analytics in order to achieve                                this things have been moving from on                                disk into doing things in memory and the                                reason is that organizations want to                                move from being reactive dealing with                                issues after they've occurred to being                                proactive and heading them off at the                                pass so we have seen analytics changing                                and moving from human data being                                processing data warehouses through                                machine data is producing loves being                                processed through big data and through                                devices that now produce billions of                                events per second and which have to be                                processed through streaming data because                                you cannot store them all but what we                                would argue is that for all of these                                other sources of data for the old-school                                database information for machine logs                                and for devices you can do all of this                                through streaming data collection and                                you'll see why this is necessary later                                on in addition the enterprise is                                expanding out it's moving out into the                                cloud and it's also having to                                incorporate IOT and it's the                                intersections between these things are                                really interesting where you start to                                have to worry about hybrid cloud how do                                you move data from on-premise to the                                cloud or vice versa and with IOT how do                                you incorporate I OT information into                                intelligent enterprise and how do you                                deal with large amounts of consumer                                information in the cloud and how do you                                deal with all of this at the same time                                which is where this notion of fog which                                is you don't really know where                                anything's happening is coming from that                                you can do computing on devices in the                                cloud in the enterprise at lots of                                different layers in order to actually                                achieve the results you want once you                                seeing more and more demands on what                                people have to do as people working in                                data architecture in IT you need to be                                able to integrate data from lots of                                different places you need to be able to                                correlate it together and perform                                analytics wherever the data comes from                                use that information to predict and make                                decisions within the enterprise and                                monitor the whole thing and really that                                combination of things is where the whole                                notion of in-memory streaming                                integration and analytics comes in we're                                streaming platforms provide this low                                latency in memory integration the                                processing monitoring visualization of                                crucially real-time data from all the                                data sources you can imagine across                                enterprise cloud and IOT in order to                                give you proactive analytics and                                important pieces that are obviously                                streaming integration and analytics this                                is used to solve multiple use cases with                                an enterprise the one the basic ones we                                see and I'm only going to go through one                                use case today which incorporates all of                                these things but we see basic use cases                                which is moving data around where you're                                taking stuff from enterprise databases                                in real-time using change data capture                                you're pushing that out into the cloud                                maybe it's Amazon redshift maybe it's                                 Microsoft to do a sequel server maybe is                                 the newly announced Google bigquery in                                 the cloud which we also know support for                                 today but you're moving data around and                                 when you're moving that data around you                                 need to do it in real time you need to                                 collect your data in real time you to                                 make sure your targets are up to date                                 and you pre won't do some processing as                                 it's moving you know do some filtering                                 transformation maybe enrichment of the                                 data before you land it the other common                                 thing we see is the ability to do                                 correlation mainly correlation in time                                 where you are looking for things that                                 are happening at the same time across                                 multiple data sources and they can                                 indicate                                 more than just looking at a single data                                 source are you being attacked in                                 multiple ways they're being logged by                                 multiple security products at the same                                 time because that's a bigger issue than                                 it's just one product an IOT an edge                                 processing been able to decide where                                 your analytics happen being able to do                                 some of the processing at the edge in                                 the device moving that out into                                 analytics cluster and having control                                 over that for manufacturing monitoring                                 for logistics for health care for retail                                 these some of the common use cases that                                 we're seeing their kind of pulling all                                 these things together and of course a                                 lot of the use cases are hybrids of all                                 of these different things as well and                                 across all these use cases the goal                                 really is to reliably provide current                                 accurate and complete information so you                                 can make decisions and so you can choose                                 the right course for your company I'm                                 going to give one use case here today we                                 have a lot more videos of use cases on                                 our website but the one I'm going to                                 focus on is this real time location and                                 the example is for healthcare we can                                 also apply exactly same thing for                                 tracking things in manufacturing a                                 different number of use cases in                                 healthcare for retail for aviation and                                 other industries that involve tracking a                                 large amounts of components the                                 healthcare specific use case the goal                                 here was to be able to monitor patient                                 visits from the time they arrive until                                 the time that they leave and to do this                                 within the mainly the waiting room area                                 and the initial consultation area we                                 define different zones events of                                 interest and monitor the wait times by                                 zones and we alert if people are                                 spending to time too much time in with                                 any one place and they will need to take                                 immediate action and the end result of                                 this is to try and reduce weight so what                                 do we do we put locators around the room                                 we defined zones and when patients walk                                 in they're given a tag that tag is                                 continually tracked so we know where                                 they are and the time that they spend in                                 each zone is recorded to do this we                                 receive real-time location information                                 from the tracking devices and join that                                 with the geometry that is specified as                                 the zones and we do a spatial query here                                 in real time so we're correlating in                                 time and in space in this particular                                 query we also do aggregation and pattern                                 matching to see when people enter and                                 leave zones and how long they actually                                 spend each zone within one's own for too                                 long maybe the patient wandered off into                                 the restroom hasn't come out for ten                                 minutes that's something you may care                                 about if you're running a hospital on                                 top of all of this we built a                                 interactive dashboard that enabled                                 people to be able to monitor where all                                 the patients were was zones they were in                                 overlay the over the plan of the waiting                                 room and produce a heat map that showed                                 where people were most often whether any                                 places with too congested etc and we                                 demonstrated this actually last week at                                 Oracle OpenWorld in partnership with                                 fujitsu produce who provided the devices                                 the the hardware we provided the                                 streaming analytics platform and the                                 integration bran on the fujitsu m                                   in-memory server which is ideally suited                                 for doing this type of processing and                                 integrated with the fujitsu cloud where                                 I actually could run cloud processes to                                 to handle some of the more difficult                                 situations the benefits the customer was
