	                              so hello my name is donna decapitate IM                               a principal staff scientist at SAS and                               i'm here today to talk about the SAS                               visual investigator this is the six year                               that I'm attending the strata who pitted                               world initially it was all about                               introducing the technology of Hadoop and                               figuring out how to work with Hadoop at                               SAS I led the first Hadoop integration                                and in the beginning it was all about                                the plumbing and making things work but                                at SAS we can work with Hadoop data                                wherever you want to work with it up                                data abia in the cluster pulling data in                                or out of the cluster and since we also                                have the SAS event stream processing                                engine and this handles the velocity of                                a big data and the SAS visual                                investigator is all about exploiting our                                capabilities of getting to any data in                                building out a fraud solution one of the                                areas that SAS VI addresses is the area                                of insider threat before I started                                working on this project I didn't know                                much about insider threat there's a                                reason for that unlike large customer                                information data breach cases that are                                publicly announced to disclose your laws                                many of the most intriguing insider                                threat theft sabotage and fraud cases                                never see the light of public scrutiny                                because companies would rather not air                                their dirty laundry they don't have to                                so SAS visual investigator is all about                                making analytics actionable you know we                                can acquire analyze identify act on                                events make data-driven decisions                                investigate patterns and we do this with                                a very adaptable data model allows for                                flexible gooeys to be allowed the                                investigator can have a flexible                                environment for building their GUI where                                there's no code required to make those                                changes                                so we talked about surveillance this guy                                here somebody that we think about you                                know Snowden and sometimes the biggest                                threat to your organization maybe                                somebody you work with right and now                                we've talked about the data scientists                                in the business analyst and now we've                                got this intelligence analyst who really                                sits between these two these two people                                right and they basically this person                                will go out and investigate anomalies                                that are happening within their company                                and that's when we define the                                intelligence analyst that's who we're                                talking about and why do they matter                                well they can identify patterns of                                interests that can prompt decision                                making that can draw associations                                between disparate data sources and they                                can build investigations that can                                connect the dots and with these things                                you're going to have visualizations that                                make that easier so these are some of                                the highlighted things that we do with                                SAS visual investigator alert and event                                management search and discovery we use                                the last to search for search and                                discovery we do targeted investigations                                network building and analytics and also                                the page builder piece which allows for                                building a dashboard for the analyst and                                this all flows within the SAS fraud                                framework that we have of industry                                solutions that run on SAS and this just                                gives you a whole bunch of the features                                that this product offers be it text                                search timeline visualization you name                                it and this gives you a little glimpse                                into the visual investigator product it                                allows for search and discovery so you                                can search across all your data filter                                and visualize results and ways to                                discover partner information and conduct                                further analysis                                we have alert and event management which                                alerts we have alert queues and                                strategies that provide the intelligence                                analysts the ability to prioritize                                investigate triage and decision all in                                real time and then we have map view                                visualizations and this allows for                                performing geospatial searches and I'm                                going to give you a little glimpse into                                how this works here so here we this is a                                view the SAS visual investigator and                                 this might be the dashboard that the                                 analyst comes into its a web-based                                 interface and this allows a dashboard                                 view of the active alerts that need some                                 attention so if I was coming into work                                 in the morning I might have some                                 actionable alerts that I need to do                                 further investigation on and again this                                 is all configurable with this product be                                 it the data be at the visualization it's                                 a highly configurable interface in                                 addition to our data feeds we allow for                                 smart analytics so when we're talking                                 about doing this type of analysis and                                 you're dealing with large volumes of                                 data you really need to be smart about                                 your data because you can't really act                                 on all your data so there's lots of                                 modeling that goes on that allows for                                 acting on that data so here I'm going to                                 go and I'm going to look at this one                                 person who has a very high score of                                 doing some suspicious activity this is                                 Henry James book and if I go in and I                                 look at what's going on with Henry he                                 works in the IT area he's got definitely                                 got some peak activity going on that's                                 raising some concerns for me if I were                                 the analyst here he's doing some over                                 eyes of his antivirus software he's                                 uploading files that are suspicious                                 and this gives us a little bit more                                 detail down here about the risk factors                                 that are alerting us about this person                                 here so there's some high-risk web                                 activity and there's also some email                                 activity here so if we want to dive into                                 some of the email communications we can                                 look at some of our taxi analytics where                                 we look at the sentiment in the emails                                 and as you can see here talks about                                 there's an email here my manager is the                                 root cause that every one of us here                                 suffers well that's kind of raising some                                 eyebrows here so we might have somebody                                 who's not very happy and that might                                 indicate to us that this person might be                                 doing some suspicious activity they                                 might be looking for another job or                                 something like that but they're                                 definitely not a happy camper so if we                                 want to dive into some of the text                                 analytics we can look at some of the                                 different types of alerts that we have                                 like belligerent and different types of                                 sentiment involved with that text with                                 their emails                                 and another area that we've alerted in                                 the past we've identified that it's the                                 time of day that people might be doing                                 suspicious activity in this case there's                                 some outliers for some file uploads late                                 at night and this is another area of                                 concern that would raise this person in                                 into the queue of being suspicious we                                 also have some real time activity where                                 we can be getting some real time alerts                                 so if we wanted to look at what this                                 person was doing in real time we can                                 also come down in this case we're                                 looking at what their their search                                 activity is out on the web and we also                                 have some visualizations here so for                                 example if we wanted to look at like who                                 they might be emailing we might be able                                 to see a pattern here in this case                                 there's there's not any kind of it seems                                 to be spread out to lots of different                                 email targets here but if we go back and                                 look at how we can capture some of email                                 here this person maybe they're on their                                 lunch break and they're trying to decide                                 who they're going to vote for president                                 so they're looking at Hillary Clinton                                 emails here not anything that might lead                                 us to insider threat but potentially if                                 they start looking for some things like                                 a job so again you see the real time                                 look at the Hillary Clinton email search                                 here but if I go and I start googling                                 for banking jobs and things like this                                 this might be a reason for us to kind of                                 look at this particular person and                                 reduce their security clearance within                                 the company or something like that so                                 anyhow this just gives you a little                                 glimpse into how this product was                                 configured to handle this type of                                 activity                                 so I'm going to talk a little bit about                                 the infrastructure that supports this                                 product so SAS and visual investigation                                 is all about the analyst working with                                 the data to do their job but it provides                                 a platform for expand abilities so in                                 this case this is running on a an                                 OpenStack environment where we're using                                 cloud foundry and we have a reference                                 architecture we work with Cisco and red                                 hat to build out this reference                                 architecture and it also works with some                                 software-defined networking that cisco                                 offers which is application centric                                 infrastructure so I built a lab and this                                 is from the ground up using cisco ucs                                 the next slide goes into a little bit                                 more of the ACI fabric that Nexus                                      series because when you're dealing with                                 cloud-based solutions it really is all                                 about your networking and things like                                 that so what's interesting about working                                 with OpenStack it's a lot different than                                 working with Hadoop when you deal with                                 Hadoop distributions you pretty much get                                 a predefined set of projects that are                                 integrated into the distribution when                                 you're dealing with OpenStack you kind                                 of have to pick and choose what you're                                 going to build in my case I wanted to                                 have highly reliable storage so I pix F                                 and then I picked a quite a few of the                                 more common pieces but you have to                                 decide what type of storage are going to                                 use and things like that so anyhow this                                 is the one of the reference                                 architectures that we have for SAS                                 visual investigator it allows for                                 building out a cloud with multi-tenancy                                 and the highly elastic nature of working                                 with the cloud and the software-defined                                 networking that Cisco provided allows                                 for building out policies that make it                                 much more templated when you deal with                                 that so not only do we have the fraud                                 software offering the underlying                                 technology is really really cool and a                                 very very state-of-the-art and when                                 you're dealing with cloud foundry I                                 should add that it um in this case I                                 worked with OpenStack but cloud foundry                                 can work with a variety of                                 infrastructures                                 so if you have any further questions you                                 can visit us at the booth we're in                                     you can look at us on the web here I'm                                 geeky Donna on Twitter and or you can                                 reach out to me thank you for listening
