	                              so good afternoon gentlemen have                                       so we talk about big data and by                               definition it's not necessarily                               determinate like typical enterprise data                               in that its content is not always nicely                               and automatically catalogued as it is                               stored in real time so to leverage big                               data and expand the footprint of                               decision-making we have to be in we                                believe in the intuitive height relative                                discovery mode those who can achieve                                this discovery faster will obviously                                gain market advantage over others and                                the closer we can get to complete                                sampling of all the data the better or                                cognition will be we therefore need to                                go from controlled and partial sampling                                to complete sampling and that raises the                                confidence level of the insights that                                you're getting out of the information so                                I'd like to today demonstrate to you how                                some enterprises are very effectively                                and analyzing the most elusive he hit                                the most powerful form of big data which                                is your unstructured content for                                significant day-to-day commercial value                                and that is what is critical so that's                                the focus of the presentation today so                                if you we look at how the maturity curve                                and analytics has evolved over the years                                so first there was descriptive which is                                your hindsight what happened and then                                came the diagnostic which was oversight                                which is what is happening then was                                predictive which is foresight what we                                think will happen and then you go too                                prescriptive and this has happened very                                fast over the last few years so                                prescriptive is what now you're                                recommending what can be better outcome                                and finally where we are today cognitive                                which is the right side that means                                asking the right questions at the right                                time in the right context to make the                                right decision so in other words what is                                the next best move so we believe                                cognitive discovery and analytics is                                very critical to truly mine big data and                                leverage big data so that's your that's                                where we are so we had to mattify been                                one of the first movers from the theory                                of this you know all this is very                                logical to practical empowerment of                                business to achieve this cognitive                                capability it's all many times cognitive                                discovering analytics is talked about is                                a theory about a good subject matter but                                how do you use it in day-to-day work                                that has been the challenge with you                                know the whole big data journey so let's                                take one particular use case in this                                case a global payments processor                                receives streaming information for                                hundreds of millions of retail                                transactions in a two-hour window these                                transactions come from tens of thousands                                of different point of sale and online                                systems consequently the data that's                                received such as merchant names                                transaction types are far from                                standardized in addition to being                                captured in its full form data is often                                truncated recorded in common                                abbreviations sonai adding a lot of                                noise or identified as a brand or a                                parent company name so applebees could                                be applebees or it could be XYZ company                                that owns that franchise so there was no                                normalized merchant knowledge base as                                such to add to this challenge the data                                arrived in different formats from the                                various system so it was nearly                                impossible to determine where each field                                would be located in                                particular file the pressure to deliver                                highly relevant offers in this to our                                window resulted in very high false                                positives because you have to complete                                that and go to the next window and as a                                result a lot of much and dissatisfaction                                and a lot of revenue leakage so this was                                too time-consuming and cost prohibitive                                to address manually or semi manually or                                semi-automatically or linearly because                                the scale of the problem increased                                exponentially as new merchants were                                added and new data started coming in                                instead our platform which is a                                combination of various cognitive                                 technologies in one seamless platform                                 was layered on the existing Hadoop                                 ecosystem in which all these                                 transactions were captured to resolve                                 these challenges so in designing a                                 platform we recognize that humans tend                                 to discover and analyzed by asking                                 questions not thinking code that you                                 know and users can't think about core so                                 we introduced a search based interface                                 to cognitive analytics the good old                                 search bar so you have freeform business                                 language Prairie so we allowed words in                                 any order describing objects products                                 that attributes features timeframes that                                 may be used to compose a query with                                 multiple variables that is intuitive to                                 the non-technical end user that's very                                 important so they don't have to depend                                 on data experts and scientists to go                                 take time and bring out stuff for them                                 so the third thing we use his knowledge                                 models and mythologies unlike other                                 tools that start from the data level and                                 what we call is a losing battle to tag                                 every possible knowledge nugget that is                                 constantly streaming in we start by                                 capturing the knowledge of business                                 users and the data scientists into a                                 knowledge model and then unleash that                                 knowledge graph in a very highly                                 automated fashion into the data so in                                 this case merchants were identified                                 based on attributes like location in                                 common transaction types used by a                                 particular merchant in addition they                                 were able to understand the different                                 components of address and understand                                 patterns used for writing street names                                 as detailed as that as graphical as that                                 synonyms and variations were considered                                 to ensure that a concept would be                                 recognized regardless of how it was                                 described recorded the knowledge model                                 was applied to both structured and                                 unstructured data like PDF Excel and                                 others and across multiple disparate                                 data sources we also have a security                                 layer with fine grain access control you                                 know from a security standpoint which is                                 another thing that's missing today and a                                 lot of the big data exploration tools                                 the fourth element is machine learning                                 obviously using varied string Mac                                 matching algorithms the platform                                 identified in real time the most likely                                 merchant name or transaction type or                                 city or state when data is truncated                                 irregularly to figure out possible                                 matching words so it created these                                 algorithms and semantic filters to                                 enrich the knowledge base so that's the                                 learning platform such as conducting                                 pattern analysis to find out new                                 merchants to add to the system                                 so the result was it identified all the                                 false transaction data and all the noise                                 that was creating huge false positives                                 so they were at a high of about sixty                                 percent false positives and in the first                                 pass itself we dropped that down to                                 about fifteen percent there will always                                 be false positives because the                                 confidence level is never going to be                                 one hundred percent an unstructured                                 content but certainly ninety-three                                 ninety-four ninety-five percent you can                                 achieve it empowered the business users                                 to more readily identify all the                                 elements and locations of the of that                                 bad data and maybe compartmentalize that                                 out and within each required narrow                                 window of a couple of hours it sent out                                 millions of these highly relevant                                 promotions to these customers who                                 conducted these millions of transactions                                 based on understanding recent                                 transaction pattern cross-referencing                                 with demographics financials and other                                 indicators so once again please note                                 that the platform has the rare                                 functionality to concurrently mind both                                 structured and unstructured content for                                 this cognitive discovery and analytics                                 so this is just one of the many examples                                 each one of our solutions is nothing but                                 a knowledge model with a security module                                 around it and the metadata that we                                 create so there's no hardware it's a                                 very light footprint but it yes it                                 requires to sit
