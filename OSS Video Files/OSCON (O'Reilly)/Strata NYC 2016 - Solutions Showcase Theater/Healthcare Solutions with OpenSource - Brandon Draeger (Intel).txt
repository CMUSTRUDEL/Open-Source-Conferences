	                              good morning everyone so I'm Brandon                               Draeger i work at Intel and I'm the                               director of product management in our                               analytics solutions group and one of the                               projects that my team works on is making                               contributions back to a project called                               the trusted analytics platform so it's a                               actually a project we launched last year                               at strata and it's aimed at simplifying                                the process of being able to deliver                                analytics and analytics applications to                                production so a lot of collaboration                                capabilities and platform capabilities                                we're trying to provide for data                                scientists and application developers to                                to work together so today I'm actually                                like to talk a little bit and the talk                                today about a use case so we worked on                                with with a customer in in France                                related to healthcare so it was with the                                the public assistance hospital of Paris                                so it's a PHP transmogrify that and                                French I won't try to do that today and                                embarrass myself but a PHP is the                                actually the largest hospital network                                not just in France but in Europe so they                                see around seven million patients a year                                in the network and they're also one of                                the one of the companies within France                                has really been at the forefront of                                adopting a lot of new information                                systems and data collection technologies                                so they collected you know over a decade                                just a volume of really valuable data                                for both operational and clinical                                information so so based on the in the                                long-term relationship that Intel's had                                with a PHP we sat down with them and                                started talking about how how could we                                help them start seeing a little bit more                                value out of that data so they could get                                some additional you know operational and                                business insights and the first issue                                they actually brought up with us was                                around ER overcrowding so for you know                                ER overcrowding it's really kind of an                                interesting one so you have us have been                                to an ER I don't think anyone would                                describe the experiences as pleasant                                usually going there for four not a great                                reason and you typically have no wait a                                long time so actually you know in                                and really in the large metropolitan                                areas there are a lot of folks that                                actually just use the ER as kind of                                their if their main primary physician                                right so they don't have a doctor that                                they're going to all the time or it's                                not convened for them to get to the                                doctor all the time so whether they've                                got a cold or they broke their arm or                                something even more serious they're                                going to the ER so as a result of that                                you know the wait time for those                                patients on average within the network                                is anywhere from six to eight hours so                                that's just at the pretty long time to                                wait to see a doctor it's obviously not                                only does this you know going to create                                strain for the the patient's themselves                                but also for the the resources within                                the hospital so it's very very hard on                                the on the administrative staff to                                figure out how many doctors are going to                                need how many nurses they're going to                                need how many beds they're going to need                                so it's a real problem and you know kind                                of creates a bad experience for                                everybody and then obviously you that'll                                get worse when there's no major                                unplanned spikes so there's a big flu                                outbreak or you know another unforeseen                                event like even it's been happening and                                France lately for some of these                                terrorist activities and then also you                                know unforeseen weather events can also                                trigger you know kind of these big                                increases so this was seen actually a                                couple years ago there was a major heat                                wave in France and it was around                                                                                                             of that actually dozens of people passed                                away and they look back and try to                                figure out you how could they have                                alleviated that problem a lot of it was                                really kind of lack of preparedness for                                emergency resources and and having the                                right level staff and resources                                available in these hospitals and making                                 that accessible to to patients so you                                 know this was obviously you know a major                                 major issue that they've been                                 wonderfully to the French government put                                 a lot of new investment into into being                                 able to flesh out these capabilities                                 so probably won't surprise anybody this                                 isn't a only French problem right so                                 this is also you know we're seeing the                                 same kind of situation in the u.s. again                                 in a large metropolitan cities folks are                                 going into those er's as they're the                                 primary physician so it's you know it's                                 kind of the or crowding issue is                                 similarly bad here in the US and if you                                 look out you know kind of progress out a                                 couple years in the future this problem                                 really isn't seem to be getting any                                 better right we're going to see a lot of                                 population growth and the estimates are                                 showing that over the next                                          pretty much all the population growth                                 like ninety percent of population growth                                 in the world is actually going to happen                                 in these large metropolitan areas so                                 you've got these you know hospitals                                 they're all really strained kind of the                                 breaking point already and you add on to                                 that huge amounts of population growth                                 over the next                                                        going to be continue to be a major major                                 issue so looking at you know and kind of                                 a current problem they are having and                                 kind of looking in the future you know                                 this is this is an issue type of until                                 the issue they didn't tell really likes                                 to get involved with so again sat down                                 with a PHP and talked to them a bit                                 about you know how can we solve this                                 problem what kind of outcome they were                                 looking for and their problem statement                                 was really simple they're like look we                                 want to we've got these administrative                                 staff doctors nurses they're not going                                 to be you know data science gurus or                                 anything else we need to give them                                 simple tools that they can use but they                                 can do their job so they want to be able                                 to have you know kind of insight into                                 what they you know expect to happen from                                 a you know from a intake perspective for                                 ER patients so that's that's really kind                                 of the problem we started drilling into                                 with them and so we've identified you                                 know wanted to have like this historical                                 view and also this future view but they                                 also said okay we've got all these other                                 challenges for any kind of tool that                                 we're putting together first and                                 foremost for them was data privacy so us                                 data privacy rules are strict times like                                 a hundred for what's what's in place in                                 France and Europe as far as data privacy                                 there's really severe penalties for any                                 major breaches of any Davis lost or                                 compromised so data privacy was a major                                 issue for them                                 and they also talked about scalability                                 right so they've got                                                   data from all these different sources                                 that want to start tapping into that's                                 only going to continue to grow they're                                 seeing seven million patients a year so                                 that's just going to be kind of an                                 exponential growth for them year on year                                 so scalability was was really important                                 for them and also scalability from a                                 standpoint of they wanted to have you                                 know a platform that they could use to                                 build not just one application but they                                 have all these other data problems so                                 they want to be able to have something                                 in place they can continue to grow with                                 so you know has a result of that you                                 know we sat down with them and said hey                                 you know working on this project called                                 the trust state analytics platform an                                 angry that was a good fit for us to                                 start kind of our collaboration so again                                 trusting analytics platform just kind of                                 a quick refresher for if you're not                                 familiar with it it's a project we                                 launched a year ago here at strata so                                 it's essentially you know a platform                                 we're aiming at data scientists and                                 application developers to improve their                                 collaboration so we can provide all                                 these new environments for data science                                 to work in and also application                                 developers so it's really kind of a                                 based on a lot of you know kind of tried                                 and true open source technologies so for                                 example you're using clutter ahead you                                 for the data platform we're using a lot                                 of Python you know tools and libraries                                 for the data scientist and then we're                                 also providing your integration with a                                 lot of you know popular application                                 environments and we bring all that                                 together so once analytics are created                                 and the models are created themselves                                 then it's also a platform for delivery                                 of pushing those as applications to                                 production so it's definitely you know                                 kind of that completeness elevated                                 platform and then tells a lead                                 contributor and to the trusting                                 analytics platform and we're really                                 focused on you know curating all these                                 tools making sure they work together and                                 right you've got                                                       getting those doll work together ensure                                 that they're you know without                                 appropriate versions are integrated and                                 secures has really been kind of a key                                 area of focus so now if you look ahead                                 you know kind of the the end of our                                 story the application is complete and                                 kind of resulted in this application web                                 application that                                 both administrators and nurses and                                 doctors could use providing a                                        window for them to look at so we took                                 all their kind of a historical                                 information and we also brought in some                                 additional external data so whether data                                 some social media data and then also a                                 couple different sources for indicators                                 of like flu outbreak that kind of thing                                 so that was just kind of a starting                                 point so we used in a little techy so                                 use a Remax as some time series analysis                                 on that so it's kind of very common set                                 of libraries used for like stock market                                 analysis that kind of thing so it's a                                 very similar kind of problem statement                                 for them on wanting to look at both                                 historical information and then have all                                 these kind of time series information                                 with these exogenous variables that they                                 could bring into that as well from all                                 the weather data and everything else to                                 kind of get a few into the future so                                 they're very happy with the application                                 and now that they've got the trusting in                                 the loots platform in place they can                                 also use that to build future                                 applications so the next one they're                                 going to build is actually turn this                                 internal tool they have outwardly facing                                 so patients can go online and say okay                                 I've got a cold so I'm going to go to                                 hospital hey or bee Hospital a has a                                 six-hour way Hospital B has a                                           wait so I'm going to the hospital be and                                 then they're also looking to roll that                                 out to another ambulance system as well                                 to you know handle kind of unexpected                                 major emergencies so they can route                                 ambulances appropriately okay so that's                                 the end of the talk and if you want to                                 learn more about the trust and analytics                                 platform encourage you to go to trust in                                 analytics org and thank you for your                                 time today appreciate it
