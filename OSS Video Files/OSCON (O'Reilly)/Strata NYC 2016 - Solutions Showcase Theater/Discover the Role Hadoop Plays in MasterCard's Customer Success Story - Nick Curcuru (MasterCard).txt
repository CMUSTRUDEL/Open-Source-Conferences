today we are                                going to talk about how we at mastercard                                use big data and this needs to be                                interactive so ask me questions and also                                don't forget to fill out the forms for                                the drawing that isn't behind you on                                those tables okay just want to make sure                                you guys take part in that as well but                                let's talk about MasterCard first thing                                MasterCard is actually two companies                                it's a technology company first and                                foremost which people don't know we are                                the plastic so who has a MasterCard                                awesome who doesn't get the hell out                                leave right now and there's applications                                at the front booths okay just let you                                know so but no MasterCard believe it or                                not we don't issue credit cards we take                                care of the technology behind the credit                                card we run the rails the other thing                                that we do is consulting we have an                                entire consulting division under                                mastercard advisors and that's my world                                and my world about big data when I say                                big data everyone's like oh what the                                hell is that for us at mastercard this                                is what that is                                                  worldwide                                                          transactions per hour                                           transactions think that comes out every                                an annual basis and we process every                                transaction in sub seconds we actually                                have one point nine million rules that                                we apply to every one of those                                transactions                                                        fraud looking for anti money laundering                                and yes we are the reason that when you                                travel from New York and you go to                                California we're the ones calling up is                                that really you that went to California                                right we want to know but that's our big                                data and what do we do with it now my                                side of the house turns that into                                intelligence                                because data means nothing by itself I                                tell that to anybody data means nothing                                what I give from data is information and                                intelligence something my wife always                                tells me I lack but that's the other                                part that we want to be able to derive                                and for us at mastercard when we take a                                look at that let's just take a look at                                what we know about the customer that's                                just one aspect because I can do local                                market intelligence I can do Regional                                Intelligence I can help governments I                                can do a lot of things with our data                                today we're just going to dive deep into                                the customer world so when you think                                about Big Data everybody wants to know                                hey what's my customer profile well we                                actually want to know what you're                                purchasing profile is you know why                                because what people purchase actually is                                more reflection of who they are than                                anything else you purchase what you are                                we also want to know propensity the                                customers ability to purchase something                                into the future believe it or not we can                                predict when someone's ready for a new                                car because we see the transactions that                                start to happen at the local tire                                company at the local you know we call                                mechanics we start to see the tickets go                                up right larger and larger transactions                                which means eventually that person is                                going to probably be in the market for a                                new vehicle as those transactions go up                                at those particular auto repair shops we                                can predict that with accuracy it's                                another way we use our data that's the                                propensity side but the other three                                components are actually these bottom                                three from here down we're starting to                                get into purchase rhythm purchase                                affinities and purchase sequencing                                believe it or not people create patterns                                right that's what we understand with                                data people go to a grocery store                                generally on the same day every week                                people visit merchants dry cleaners at                                 the same time every day generally if we                                 can start sequencing when people are                                 going to locations we start to                                 understand their rhythm is it twice a                                 week three times a week is it once a                                 week and then start to work with how                                 that begins worth affinities that if                                 they go to this store or that merchant                                 they're all                                 going to probably visit these other two                                 merchants as well that starts to play                                 into what we call a full knowledge of                                 our customer base so once you start                                 tearing to take a look at is for like a                                 grocery store if you shop on a Thursday                                 regularly when do we want to send you an                                 email on the Wednesday or the Thursday                                 morning and if i see that you shop there                                 on a thursday i can stop email                                 communications right because what's one                                 of the most annoying things every                                 morning you wake up with a hundred                                 emails from one particular merchant and                                 you're like every single day only shop                                 at your store once a week I only shop at                                 your store once a month but you keep                                 sending these damn emails right but if I                                 can sequence that I can make it a better                                 experience for the customer and provide                                 them the relevant information they need                                 at the right time is that what we're                                 supposed to do so as we start to take a                                 look at that I also start to predict                                 where you're going so I know brick and                                 mortar I know if you're going to be                                 online I can even figure out the ones                                 where you share you both go online and                                 at brick and mortars what does that mean                                 well I can actually even tell you where                                 you're spending so take a look at that                                 how powerful does that become for                                 merchants if i can tell you basically if                                 this person in this particular group a                                 goes to these type of restaurants quick                                 service restaurants that's what q sr                                 stands for and they like Chipotle                                 McDonald's Starbucks subway and Taco                                 Bell five miles away five miles away                                 that's it though ease people enjoy                                 Burger King subway McDonald Tim Hortons                                 and Starbucks it's a different marketing                                 campaign isn't it it's a different world                                 isn't it I can actually give these                                 people what they want when they need it                                 that's the power of MasterCard and our                                 big data is it be able to help people                                 understand how people are spending when                                 they're spending and where they're                                 spending it but yet there's more there's                                 more why because I can also start to                                 tell them the affinities so some of                                 these people who like these in this                                 particular group and under spin                                 and they like eating places Airlines and                                 family apparel again different then the                                 other side of the house grocery stores                                 women's apparel and eating places eating                                 places are combined there in both groups                                 but I can also tell you where they don't                                 like to spend these people don't like                                 public transportation either group so I                                 don't want to create a partnership                                 potentially with them with those people                                 but I want to create a partnership with                                 the others yes ma'am you know what                                 that's a great question the interesting                                 part is usually when they use with your                                 card its top of wallet you'll use it for                                 your everyday spend so there is a                                 correlation between what we see spending                                 and what they do most people only use                                 one card across all their daily spend                                 but you bring up a good point we can                                 start to predict three transactions when                                 people are about to switch cards on the                                 churn so that's another way that we                                 actually start to take a look at our day                                 and say hey we can help our issue is                                 understand these customers are using you                                 less and less looks like they're                                 probably looking for a different card to                                 put top of wallet good question the                                 other question is once I know wallet                                 share I can go deeper even deeper I can                                 help customers understand where people                                 are spending how often they're spending                                 and if they're spending with their peers                                 again I don't tell them who their peer                                 group is okay I've got to protect my                                 other merchants here but I can tell them                                 their share of wallet I can tell them                                 how much they spend with you versus the                                 other their average ticket I can tell                                 frequency and I can also tell you that's                                 the percentage of the share of wallet                                 but understand for those customers these                                                                                                          are not frequent shoppers with you but                                 they know of you they're in your store                                 less than once a month but they're in                                 your competitors nearly twice a month                                 let's go after those guys right away                                 that helps you start focusing where you                                 want to start committing dollars for                                 marketing because they know who you are                                 they've been in your store they're                                 familiar with you these guys over here                                 they're actually not even in your store                                 but there with your peer group                                 again think about how you use that data                                 there with your peer group but there's                                 no spend with you again another group to                                 go after when you start taking a look at                                 where do I want to try to get my market                                 spin if I want to increase wallet share                                 but I want to increase acquisition these                                 guys are whom I'm trying to come after                                 again this is one way you can work with                                 big data and oh by the way when you put                                 a marketing campaign out there I can                                 tell you if it worked because I can see                                 if they bought something with you                                 because I see the closed loop you sent a                                 message I can travel through the                                 customer journey it could be two or                                 three touch points and then come back                                 around and say yep they came in your                                 store they went to your website or they                                 came in your store and went to your                                 website and made a purchase again we                                 close the loop that's my world that's                                 what makes my world so cool is when I                                 can actually create that closed loop to                                 say that campaign that you spent                                   million on brought                                                    door is it worth it that campaign that                                 when                                                                     if you're a hotel you're able to put                                 heads and beds if you run a sports                                 franchise you put cheeks and seats I can                                 measure it that's again the way we at                                 mastercard help you help our customers                                 use big data start to use the closing of                                 the loop to help them understand more                                 about their customers and that's only                                 one way we do it there's plenty more and                                 I'm here all week just to try to talk to                                 you about everything that we do because                                 this is what excites me every morning                                 this is what you know my wife doesn't go                                 shopping with me by the way for this                                 reason because I walk around the stores                                 and i'm actually walking through and                                 saying how did they merchandise did they                                 merchandise that way that way so again i                                 get to talk to you guys because my wife                                 doesn't let me talk when i come home so                                 what questions y'all have what questions                                 come on you got to have questions                                 but believe it or not here in North                                 America they're using less cash they're                                 using more debit cards so they're                                 substituting cash for debit card so the                                 question was do you see people using                                 more cash more they're substituting cash                                 for debit cards that's north as we do                                 because we do debit cards so we have                                 seen the debit card spend start to rise                                 working with our banking partners we                                 also understand how the cash outgoings                                 isn't as much but through our double                                 cards which we do issue we help other                                 organizations issue including gift cards                                 we've seen that spin go up in North                                 America across Latin American Central                                 America and debit cards are just                                 starting to come out in Europe they're                                 just starting their spending Europe what                                 other questions that's the question                                 right there how do we ensure the privacy                                 of our customers two ways we at                                 mastercard only use anonymized data we                                 have to rely upon in North America                                 especially in the u.s. a different third                                 party to de-identify a customer as they                                 come into our analysis and then we will                                 help will use a third party or our                                 customer or client themselves to react n                                 tify on the back end we don't carry PII                                 information through our analysis we                                 actually make sure we don't so we                                 actually strip it out mask it run the                                 analysis say here's the list we identify                                 now the nice part about that is when you                                 take a look at security it's actually                                 what you should be doing with your                                 marketing team right you only want the                                 people identified on that list right not                                 the entire list you don't have to carry                                 a name all the way through just at the                                 back end here's the                                                     after out of the million in population                                 ok I have I can answer more but not with                                 this microphone on I'm being told it's                                 time to leave but I don't want to go
