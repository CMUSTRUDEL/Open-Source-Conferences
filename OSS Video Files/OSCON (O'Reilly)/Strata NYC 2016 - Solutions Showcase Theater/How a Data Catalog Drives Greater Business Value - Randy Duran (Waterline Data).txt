	                              thank you for watching this talk about                               water line data it's a solution showcase                               and today I'm going to be highlighting                               one of our clients and really I want to                               start with you understanding who water                               line data is and then we'll get into                               some of the problems our customers have                               had and how we've solved them first a                               little bit about myself I'm a technology                                evangelist part of the sales                                organization i joined water line data in                                                                                                       clients all over the United States as                                well as globally background about water                                line data we were founded in late                                     and our engineering team came out with                                the first version of our product version                                one in later in                                                         months and our credit to our engineering                                team who has a lot of background in the                                area of discovery our company has very                                strong investors like menlo ventures                                Jackson Square Ventures a lot of                                advisors that you can see as well as a                                lot of partners we are Hadoop                                distribution agnostic which makes it                                easy for customers to pick whichever                                Hadoop distribution they want or need                                and can change in the future what we do                                is we market a smart data catalog it at                                a very high level helps organizations                                make better decisions with their data                                that's a lofty kind of statement but the                                way we do that is by enabling data                                self-service data analysts data                                scientists and others throughout the                                enterprise can search for data on their                                own because we enable essentially what                                you would call an enterprise data                                marketplace very much like your favorite                                shopping site you might shop it amazon                                you might shop at Costco the way that                                you can search for products we have a                                lot of very large customers a lot of                                interest in the market we cover several                                different verticals like health care                                banking which those two for example have                                a lot of regulatory compliance life                                sciences                                automotive and retailing even aerospace                                and government and it is very                                interesting that even the very largest                                corporations in the world have been                                interested because of the problem that                                we solve I want to showcase a client                                that is an international multi-line                                insurer they use water line data in                                several production environments and                                there's a quote from their global head                                of data governance risk and standards                                that said understanding where your data                                came from and what it means in context                                is vital to making data an initiative                                successful too vital to making a data                                initial one more time it's vital to                                making a data lake initiative successful                                and not just another data quagmire and                                the the key part is the catalog plays a                                critical component in this they had a                                number of objectives they want to make                                Hadoop a strategic platform we see a lot                                of clients of ours who are trying to                                move to Hadoop from say relational world                                and they want it to be a strategic                                platform they want to make raw data sets                                available and not necessarily have a                                sequel interface they want to enable                                data self-service for the entire                                enterprise and they want to ensure                                regulatory compliance across key areas                                so there's a lot of governance built in                                and they want to they want water line                                data to validate and catalog their data                                assets a couple of things or a few                                things that they want to avoid our                                manual process and intervention when                                you're talking about a data leak there's                                a lot of metadata they want to avoid the                                manual effort they want to avoid                                anything that would make self-service                                unachievable in other words self-service                                is a must-have they want to avoid policy                                violations related to global data                                ownership and multi-tenancy stewardship                                you know which team owns the glossary                                which team owns the definition of                                sensitive data so you get a sense for                                their goals and also what they want to                                avoid what we've noticed some clients in                                 the past have tried to do our number one                                 build a catalog in-house sometimes                                 especially a few years ago before we                                 existed there was no other solution                                 except build yourself but it's hard to                                 keep up with an evolving ecosystem it's                                 hard to keep up with new technologies                                 like spark how about waiting until the                                 dated lake gets big call us in a few                                 months we're going to grow it's going to                                 take time for you to put a solution into                                 production and to really get your                                 organization used to a self-service                                 model so it's better to start earlier                                 how about managing metadata with                                 spreadsheets we've had some clients say                                 that they will manage their metadata but                                 that's really hard to track over time                                 this the minute you click save on the                                 spreadsheet something has already                                 changed and how about the traditional                                 model of we don't want self-service we                                 want people to go through IT it's not                                 necessary anymore for IT to be a                                 bottleneck IT certainly is in charge of                                 the process most of the time but I T can                                 embrace through a safe access like our                                 product provides ID can embrace the                                 self-service model this is a picture of                                 metadata it's this is a flea market but                                 it's like looking at data in the sense                                 of if you try to go buy something at                                 this market like a picture you would                                 just have to wander through the aisles                                 you don't have a list the catalog that                                 you can compare what's available what                                 where it is and how much it costs and                                 that's multiplied many many times                                 especially when you consider the field                                 level you might have a lot of data sets                                 how many fields are in each data set it                                 just exits exponentially larger the                                 solution of our product is to provide a                                 high degree of automation we say that                                 we're a smart data catalog our product                                 automatically catalogs it automatically                                 classifies it automatically tags and                                 discovers data lineage and it keeps an                                 audit trail of everything the the                                 product keeps data profiles and data                                 lineage also audit history like I                                 mentioned                                 and we think of it if you had to walk                                 away remembering water line data we                                 deliver value on three dimensions one is                                 we improve time to value automatically                                 cataloging data assets across all the                                 data that you have and enabling                                 self-service that's time to value tribal                                 knowledge sharing because we can augment                                 semantic discovery with tags then we're                                 actually instead of people keeping that                                 information to themselves it's easy with                                 our crowdsource mechanism for people to                                 share the information they have if I                                 share a little bit of what I know and my                                 colleagues here share a little bit you                                 end up with a wealth of metadata in                                 addition to the technical metadata that                                 we capture and then trust its agile                                 governance and it starts with tagging                                 the data it's it continues with data                                 lineage knowing the provenance and where                                 data set came from and secure self                                 service keep in mind when somebody                                 accesses the catalog with water line                                 data they're not accessing the data lake                                 itself you can form a barrier separation                                 because I'm only going to the catalog                                 you don't have to give me access to the                                 data but furthermore if I don't have                                 read access to the data I won't the                                 catalog knows that and it will not let                                 me see data values so it still protects                                 me and the organization when someone                                 doesn't have read access it doesn't                                 matter if it's from neva Madera                                 navigator or Apache Ranger through                                 Kerberos permissions or HDFS our product                                 looks at the lowest level possible to                                 see what permissions you have the                                 product runs natively on Hadoop and                                 integrates with a lot of products so                                 just showing you a timeline what I want                                 you to remember is that the water line                                 data is in the middle which means that                                 we're not interfering with the early                                 part of ingestion we're not interfering                                 with data prep which might happen later                                 we're a catalog that sits on top of the                                 data layer and all we do is help we're                                 not stepping on other other toes                                 results like I mentioned just to say one                                 more time remember the                                               value instead of a person spending on                                 average I've read two and a half to                                 three hours a day searching for data                                 they're able to use the catalog find a                                 data set and even provision that into a                                 hive table or directly launch a product                                 like trifecta right from our product the                                 tribal knowledge sharing is the ability                                 for instead of me hoarding the                                 information I have with a product like                                 this we make it easy to share and then                                 trust we we surround our product with                                 governance on the access control on the                                 authorization side in the discovery of                                 sensitive data and you're separating the                                 catalog from the actual data I just want                                 to end with a little bit of additional                                 information you can learn more about our                                 product by
