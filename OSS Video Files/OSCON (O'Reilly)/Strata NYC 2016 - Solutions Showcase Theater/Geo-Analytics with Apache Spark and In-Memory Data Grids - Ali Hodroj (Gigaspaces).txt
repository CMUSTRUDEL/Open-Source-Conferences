	                              my name is Alejandra and I run product                               and strategy for the in-memory computing                               division of Giga spaces and today we're                               going to talk about the value of a Jo                               analytics or geospatial intelligence                               within the context of fast data and                               real-time analytics so just a quick                               brief about Giga spaces we've been in                               the business of in-memory computing for                                about                                                                 about                                                                 fortune                                                           verticals started initially within                                financial services we were one of the                                first to digitize Wall Street working                                with you know millisecond and micro                                second latency top of workloads moved                                the know-how and capability to                                telecommunications and intelligent call                                center routing retail and a few other                                verticals our flagship product was x AP                                which is an in-memory data grid and                                recently we took the core engine of x AP                                and embedded it within apache spark or                                integrated with spark to create a                                high-performance park distribution known                                as inside edge which is what we're going                                to talk about today just a quick brief                                of the you know the kind of public                                facing companies that do work with                                spaces you'll notice pretty much the                                who's who of the global                                           financial services to retailers                                telecommunication providers as well as                                other businesses as well so why is                                geospatial intelligence or analytics                                important and why is it gaining traction                                well mainly because it's it's really at                                the confluence of three trends right now                                on one hand you have IOT and the recent                                advancements in supply chain which led                                to the proliferation of a lot of devices                                and ubiquitous sensors and data coming                                off of those gartner predicts you know                                by                                                                devices that's about seven times the                                human population on earth and the most                                of these are actually in either consumer                                electronics or automotive so definitely                                they have some geospatial aspect or data                                to them that's going to be need to be                                analyzed the second thing is the                                emergence of data science and high level                                data science machine learning frameworks                                that are accessible and democratized                                analytics to the masses                                and the third thing is the rise of you                                know big data getting more and more into                                real time and leveraging in memory and                                fast data storage you know you saw                                earlier GPU and trying to break not just                                the disk i/o bottlenecks but other ayos                                that you know I oh bottlenecks that are                                the hinder the fast processing at                                millisecond and fast scale of data so                                it's not really just to the maps and                                visualizations there's a lot of other                                aspects where a geospatial data could be                                pretty helpful and where we see a most                                is pretty much in financial services                                because when you think about fraud                                detection location data fusing that with                                also other data entities is something                                key to detect fraud or anomalies in a                                lot of transactions another area where                                we see this is in retail for example                                customer segmentation doing targeted                                advertising personalization based on you                                know where the customer is also with the                                emergence of you know RFID tags and                                smart stores that also makes location                                together quite you know quite                                interesting and important to the                                personalization and retail especially in                                omni channel and the third thing is an                                insurance because risk is often                                associated with location in these kind                                of workloads and having the capability                                to Ana scalable and fast way be able to                                predict or have certain metrics off of                                the location and use that to identify                                certain risk is something key to these                                kind of models you know across the                                analytic spectrum now the other                                interesting thing is there's still a lot                                of challenges when you try to do these                                kind of workloads and primarily if you                                look at I ot you'll notice that the kind                                of data that's coming from all of these                                 devices especially location data if you                                 think of trains and other is                                 transmitting their location and you need                                 to analyze that a lot of times that data                                 might be intermittent the train could be                                 out of coverage I could be going through                                 a tunnel so the data is going to                                 actually spend the entire continuum or                                 the streaming of it from streaming to                                 batch to all others so you want to be                                 able to blend both together the second                                 thing is you know that kind of data or                                 location is as real-time as things can                                 get so you want to be able to also react                                 to it in real-time and trigger certain                                 workflows you can't really afford the                                 bottleneck of extracting things to the                                 data center and then doing analysis                                 and then finally as that data is coming                                 in in a lot of volumes not in contrast                                 with traditional streaming where they                                 have you know one large high-throughput                                 type of streaming or stream that you're                                 processing an IOT you looking more at                                 kind of many low volume streams so we                                 need this kind of you know multi-tenancy                                 orgy Federation to be available the way                                 we approached it within giga spaces is                                 we looked at two things one you have                                 spark which is pretty much the most                                 popular and common big data analysis                                 framework out there it has a really nice                                 unified and concise way of analyzing                                 everything from basic analytics in                                 sequel all the way to high level data                                 science and machine learning we combine                                 that with our in-memory data grid which                                 is a scale-out distributed in memory                                 infrastructure that gives you                                 transactional capability and both high                                 throughput and low latency geospatial                                 and other kind of data processing now                                 the key thing of about an in-memory data                                 grid you know when people ask what is                                 the kind of core of this this layer                                 underneath apache spark that we that we                                 introduced it's basically a scale-out                                 architecture that basically utilizes                                 memory on a lot of commodity machines or                                 specialized machines and uses all of                                 that as one large federated in-memory                                 cluster it has also sequel semantics you                                 can store you know Java pojos geospatial                                 APR spatial documents or entities as                                 well as other api's as well now the end                                 result of this is a recent product we                                 introduced called inside edge which we                                 term as a high-performance spark                                 distribution and inside edge basically                                 is the combination of an in-memory data                                 grid as well as spark workloads on top                                 of it with that you can have both the                                 low latency processing of any kind of                                 data side by side with co-locating                                 transactional applications and literally                                 deploying microservices within the same                                 in-memory data fabric and this is how                                 you get this kind of closed loop                                 analytics type of type of workloads the                                 kind of API the how that looks like                                 within this context if you look into the                                 the web UI of insight edge which is you                                 know a standard Zeppelin notebook that                                 you see in any kind of spark                                 distribution                                 it's a simple modeling mechanism of we                                 use specific indexing criteria that we                                 have in our data grid underneath spark                                 in this case you know i'm specifying                                 that this gas station is indexed                                 spatially for that location or that                                 point and then you have pretty much                                 native spark api's or native geospatial                                 a place that utilize with sparks so                                 anything in spark as far as machine                                 learning a graph processing data frames                                 streaming in any kind of processing can                                 be now converged directly with                                 geospatial analysis and that's pretty                                 much the kind of the integration of both                                 to create this geospatial intelligence                                 within within spark framework if you go                                 to our website one thing also we're                                 we're demoing at the booth                                             of a replica of uber spry search which                                 combines machine learning geospatial                                 data as well as kafka and streaming data                                 pipeline to show you know how all of                                 this in practice and the key thing about                                 this is really performance and                                 simplicity performance in terms of you                                 have everything running in memory                                 between spark streaming and the data                                 grid as well as simplification where all                                 you need in this fast data pipeline is                                 just due to tears kafka and an inside                                 edge as well so there's no need to kind                                 of deal with you know the complexities                                 of something like a lambda architecture                                 or a cap architecture and one oh one                                 last thing to bring the point home is a                                 case study of one of our customers in in                                 the EU in sweden cab online is a company                                 similar to ober and it's basically                                 within the business of taxi dispatch                                 fleet management now the key challenge                                 here was not only being able to have                                 geofencing capabilities or geo spatial                                 visualization visualizations or                                 operational monitoring of taxes out                                 there but also getting insight off of                                 this data and making sure you know based                                 on these kind of locations and the                                 drivers and the passenger profile which                                 neighborhoods should i basically you                                 know allocate resources more into during                                 certain time of day what kind of pricing                                 should I introduce or the you know the                                 typical pricing surge kind of use cases                                 that you see with with uber lyft or                                 these kind of these kind of frameworks                                 based on that you know                                 what kind of analysis I can use to                                 predict and basically do better                                 placement not only of the allocation of                                 driver resources but also as                                 infrastructure resources as well and                                 focus on certain workloads more than the                                 others within the scale out                                 infrastructure so what you're seeing                                 here kind of the central piece is the is                                 the end memory data grid which it                                 doesn't disrupt the entire stack                                 basically this is an enemy fabric that                                 sits on top of existing data store it                                 loads data from sources like Hadoop                                 relational databases and others and it                                 has microservices co-located with the                                 data itself and this interact both with                                 the edge as well as with internal                                 enterprise applications it's both a the                                 the read and write scenarios are                                 happening directly against this data                                 grid with asynchronous right behind to                                 the to the data tier as you know part of                                 the foundational capabilities of the                                 grid it's elastic it's a shared nothing                                 scale out and you know just a taste of                                 you know what kind of fabric this                                 citizen within IOT or transportation use                                 cases I'll conclude with an invitation                                 to our booth the number six six seven if                                 you'd like to see a demo of inside edge                                 or both                                                                  want to demo it see it on a bun to cloud                                 as well and thank you let me know if you                                 have any questions
