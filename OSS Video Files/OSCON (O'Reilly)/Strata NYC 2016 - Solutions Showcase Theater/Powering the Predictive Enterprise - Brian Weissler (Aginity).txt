	                              so my name is Brian why slur I work for                               a company called agility we provide a                               software product called amp which                               enables enterprise analytic management                               what I'm going to do here today is                               briefly show you how one of our                               customers is creating amazing                               efficiencies and improvements in how                               they develop and deliver analytics using                                amp i'll show you how they took over                                    lines of code copied and pasted and                                maintained across                                                     to just a few api calls one select                                statement and several fewer SAS programs                                as a disclaimer amp runs on Hadoop as                                well as IBM's pure data for Melina teasy                                this customer is currently running on                                our Netezza product however the use                                cases absolutely one hundred percent                                applicable regardless of which data                                platform they're running on so the                                challenge nearly every Enterprise faces                                is that analytics are everywhere they're                                not just used everywhere but they're                                created everywhere and all sorts of                                applications with no consistency due to                                a lack of reuse and a lack of sharing so                                agility asks pretty obvious question                                what if analytics became reusable                                consistent reliable and shareable                                enterprise assets so in the next few                                minutes i'll show you how wanna jinnah t                                customers moving from analytic silos to                                manage to analytics using a Genuity amp                                so we're going to start with a SAS code                                migration sees was pretty low hanging                                fruit for this customer it's a just a                                set of programs that indexes customer                                and product affinity kind of like a                                market basket in order to run a campaign                                so before using our product they this                                team managed a shared folder of                                       programs each containing over                                          of code copied and pasted if you could                                believe that same logic was repeated not                                only across programs but even within                                programs themselves something as simple                                as an enterprise definition like active                                customers just was written over and over                                and over again so the challenge is                                pretty straightforward I think a lot of                                manual effort                                to manually build and maintain these                                programs risk of inconsistency from all                                the copying and pasting you make a                                change one place does not propagate                                everywhere else obviously difficult to                                understand just because it's code that                                does not equal transparency and                                performance bottlenecks of moving data                                back and forth between the SAS server                                and the data platform I'm actually going                                to show you sorry really quickly this is                                what that code looks like today you can                                see a bunch of products related to the                                campaign and then you see a whole bunch                                of proc sequel data preparation                                calculating metrics filters the active                                customers definition is in there several                                times right so that's what it looks like                                okay they come they implemented unity                                amp and now we're down to just                                         of code and that includes five calls to                                the agility amp command line app a one                                sequel statement and all that common                                logic has been moved into a centralized                                location inside of virginity amp upon                                further review and actually so I'll just                                show you real quick what that code now                                looks like I can't even scroll right                                this is it this is the whole darn thing                                so as I was preparing for this                                presentation I took a look and I noticed                                that one line that one sequel statement                                at the bottom turns out SAS wasn't even                                necessary at all for this use case using                                six amped derived attributes and one                                publication from our product no code                                this problem was solved now this was a                                problem of customer using SAS as sequel                                query tool or ETL engine that probably                                happens more than it should all of this                                is very applicable let's say the last                                thing they needed to do was run some                                algorithm that only SAS is capable of                                doing right this still would have                                reduced the code significantly by taking                                all the data prep in                                okay let's extend the use case and thus                                 enterprise obviously doing multi-channel                                 marketing on they're going to do so                                 using marketing automation applications                                 something like IBM campaign and the one                                 we found included                                                        exclusion segmentations etc the logic                                 again was disconnected so that same                                 active customers definition that was all                                 over the place in SAS they were defining                                 it here probably very differently                                 challenge is very similar effort to                                 maintain risk of inconsistency                                 performance bottlenecks anyone who's                                 ever dealt with any kind of marketing                                 automation software knows what this is                                 this is a campaign workflow there's                                    boxes in there each one doing stuff lots                                 of stuff after amp we're down to five                                 process boxes okay and that's because                                 all the logic again was built in amp                                 probably for that SAS use case and now                                 i'm just using it again in the marketing                                 automation use case so the last step of                                 this use case is inside the enterprise                                 obviously there are data analyst doing                                 visualizations building you know reports                                 just kind of like playing around with                                 the data etc they might be using                                 something like tableau in this case I                                 used Hugh as an example we are at a                                 Cloudera conference and so they're going                                 to take the same campaign customer index                                 that we used in the SAS program and                                 we're going to leverage it here okay so                                 before amp so I wrote this manually as a                                 part of this presentation that I was                                 preparing for amazing like                                           presentation and I you know had to build                                 all this stuff it took like two days but                                 eight snippets basically across three                                 tables custom joins filters metrics                                 right all that logic being rebuilt again                                 I don't have to tell you that challenges                                 obviously it's not reusable it's                                 potentially inconsistent and I had to                                 code it you know if I'm a user that                                 doesn't really know sequel or Scala or                                 Python that's potentially a problem                                 okay so here's what the what the                                 notebook looked like before the eight                                 snippets you can see it's all code okay                                 sorry i'm going to show you our product                                 okay so now with am it's only two                                 snippets and they're simple simple                                 select statements and how does that                                 happen because I'm publishing existing                                 derived attributes what is an existing                                 derived attribute and what is a jinnah                                 TM so this is the agility amp interface                                 okay this is where the analytics are                                 actually built and managed and                                 maintained where you build that catalog                                 so here is that campaign customer index                                 and actually I'm bending it into                                         you can see it's point-and-click I have                                 access to the entire data model and                                 actually what i'm doing here is                                 leveraging an existing derived attribute                                 that I built that's a slightly more                                 complicated looking attribute that's                                 referencing other attributes right that                                 active customer definition it's in here                                 also right so all these definitions are                                 all in here and how do I get at them i                                 can get at them through something called                                 a publication okay and all that is this                                 is one of the publication's is I'm                                 accessing that catalog of both data and                                 analytics and I'm essentially creating                                 an output table okay anything can read                                 an output table I could also output a                                 file I'm sort of running out of time                                 here so if you want to see more of this                                 see how we make analytics reusable                                 reliable consistent and shared come see                                 us at booth k                                                          partner pavilion will be given demos                                 will show you how all the stuff works I                                 can show you the entire use case or                                 other use cases alright I appreciate                                 everybody coming out even though you                                 didn't fill the comfy looking couches I                                 can see you standing out there many of                                 you did not actually leave but now you                                 can go get a beer or stay for the next                                 presentation thanks a lot
