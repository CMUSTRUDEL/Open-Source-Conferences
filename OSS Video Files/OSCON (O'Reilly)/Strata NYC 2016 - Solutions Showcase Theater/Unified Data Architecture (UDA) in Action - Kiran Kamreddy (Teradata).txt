	                              hey welcome everybody my name is a kirin                               comedy and i'm a product marketing                               manager at teradata i really appreciate                               your time coming down here in spite of a                               number of things happening at the show                               so today I'm go about the unified data                               architecture that we a teradata                               prescribe to allow for customers to                               solve big data problems and also talk                                about some of the case studies that we                                have seen some of our customers                                implementing it so I just one like                                introduced this notion of a ecosystem of                                data products because at teradata we                                really believe that and no not we really                                believe that there is no single data                                store that solves all of your data                                problems and you really need a ecosystem                                of data engines or data stores to solve                                all of your data problems so to prove                                that I am trying to like coated gockel                                research which which shows that their                                plans and research and and try to figure                                out and asked and asked the number of                                customers in terms of the different                                kinds of data stores that they have in                                production and as you can see more than                                                                                                     than one type of a data nodes back in                                the days probably data warehousing was                                the solution that was prescribed and                                there was a single system to which all                                of your data sources were extracted and                                you did a lot of analysis and reporting                                but today because you have different                                types of data you would also need                                different kinds of systems which handle                                these different data types in an                                efficient manner so after data we                                prescribe prescribe but we prescribe a                                unified data architecture which we think                                is the answer to solve different kinds                                of data problems as you can see the                                architecture itself has different layers                                and acquisition data engines analytics                                and accesses as you can see on the                                picture we really believe that it's an                                ecosystem of the products ecosystem of                                technologies and solutions that solves                                your problems and be unless a lot of                                time and resources in in figuring out                                the integration between these systems                                and figure we figuring out the Arco                                station software                                that makes all of these systems work                                interchangeable a for example if you see                                if you want to go into one step detail                                for the interest layer we think there                                needs to be an integrated in just layer                                that that accounts for all the data that                                is coming into your data systems it                                could be a data like it could be a data                                warehouse but you need to have a ingest                                layer that performs both for a real time                                data and also for steady data so tell                                rate a listener is the product or the                                offering that we offer at the inn just                                layer this is a new product rental data                                it's a really modern a service that we                                are building using modern software                                techniques like half commit source using                                OpenStack there where we are building                                this using a micro services architecture                                the objective of this product is to be a                                self-service application for programmers                                and data scientists who wish to ingest                                different kinds of data into the data                                stores and then write it to them to a                                series of data stores which it could be                                readily it could be a data warehouse or                                could be any other data store and                                provides designed for high scalability                                and availability in complexity so if you                                double click on the data lake dead lake                                diagram so of                                                    appliance offering it's ready to run                                appliance we call it till date appliance                                for Hadoop we have just announced the                                latest version that's the opponent's                                  in this area so the object of the                                appliance is to like take out all of                                your deployment challenges                                implementation challenges of a doop doop                                and really give you a ready to go                                solution with which you can still start                                working on your Hadoop use cases so                                industry research shows that it takes                                anywhere between six to eight months to                                actually get your Hadoop running so                                 that's a lot of time to be able to like                                 go from an initial concept phase to a                                 proof-of-concept to a proof-of-concept                                 stage so we really try to accelerate the                                 value that you get from your Hadoop                                 projects through this Hadoop of clients                                 so they                                 a lot of things there and sense of you                                 get a single vendor support for the                                 appliance you don't have to deal with                                 your operation with your OS vendor or                                 your Hadoop vendor or your networking                                 window you just have one window to deal                                 with and that's teradata the appliance                                 has some high-performance components                                 like buying it over infiniband teradata                                 viewpoint held at the studio are some of                                 the tools that are very familiar with                                 very familiar to our to the folks who                                 have been using teradata for a while now                                 so it kind of like makes it easy for                                 them to bring in Hadoop into the wider                                 data ecosystem and we offer the                                 appliance with flexible configurations                                 in the sense that we do an appliance                                 with a cloud error distribution we also                                 do an appliance with with hortonworks                                 and we offered this appliance in three                                 different hardware configurations                                 performance balance and capacity so it                                 depends on the customer use case so                                 depending on the customer use case we                                 prescribe a specific configuration of                                 the appliance because performance is                                 something will prescribe for a high CPU                                 intensive job capacity for a long-term                                 data storage kind of a job and obviously                                 these three different configurations are                                 available at different price points so                                 if you look at the virtual query phase                                 so we have a product call which we call                                 it a little weary grid and quad very                                 great does is it provides with it a                                 fabric that enables you to write a query                                 and not really worry about whether that                                 did actually the sides and query grid                                 gives you an ability to integrate data                                 from different data stores like data                                 warehouse your Hadoop your data                                 discovery systems are or even Oracle or                                 to one extent the objective is to like                                 provide answers equal based platform and                                 give the ability to query different                                 kinds of data stores integrate the data                                 from this different data stores and I                                 really give this single and unified                                 platform                                 so if you look at the consumption layer                                 we offer something called App Center we                                 call so the App Center is truly targeted                                 for the end users in terms of being able                                 to like consume all the all the layers                                 that kind of like come before it so it's                                 basically consumption layer to make it                                 really easy for for people like for                                 people who are focused on business like                                 like a marketing guy like a finance guy                                 and AB center is where you can create                                 these apps to make them to make all of                                 these services easily consumable so                                 another quickly move from technology to                                 some of the customer cases that have                                 deployed UDA for the challenges to look                                 at a digital photo company and they had                                 a problem of what they wanted to really                                 optimize their demand generation funnel                                 and because they were collecting a lot                                 of data that the users were going                                 through their website like they were                                 collecting a ton of web click clicks                                 data and the existing data store her                                 stood existing structural grid a store                                 which is a data warehouse was not really                                 cost efficient to store that huge                                 amounts of data so what did was they                                 approached us and we prescribe them you                                 da and through the UDA they started to                                 use teradata idw and hair data appliance                                 for Hadoop and obviously the appliance                                 was the Hadoop appliance was used to                                 land a lot of this clickstream data but                                 it was obviously unstructured which had                                 high volumes and owns only once they                                 start to structure the data they started                                 to realize the value and you always had                                 access to the terror idw and so the                                 virtual query face virtual ferry layer                                 through the query grid they were able to                                 integrate the data on Hadoop and data                                 warehouse to really able to like figure                                 out the behavioral analysis of their of                                 their of their end customers and and the                                 pattern in which they were uploading the                                 photos to their website and in the                                 pattern in which they were creating                                 demand for their products so impaired so                                 impact was obviously they were able to                                 like develop deeper customer insights                                 because of the different kinds of data                                 that was available to help them and and                                 and and more because they were able to                                 like integrate this data to develop                                 integrated analytics so if you look at a                                 quick architecture diagram if you look                                 at the first phase a lot of the cryptic                                 clickstream data was not really                                 integrated with your operational data                                 Mart operator operational data stores                                 but if you look at the picture of the                                 right with the UDA implemented you                                 really have the structured data really                                 integrated with your data warehouse and                                 that's how you were able to like perform                                 integrated analytics and analysis so I'm                                 going to quickly pass through because                                 I'm running out on time so there's                                 another leading insurance provider who                                 actually wanted to combine a lot of the                                 telematics data so telematics data is                                 the data that your sensors on your                                 automobile provide so they wanted to                                 integrate the telematics data with their                                 relational data that was existing the                                 edw to be able to like adjust their auto                                 premiums on the fly for example there                                 was there was a tons of data that was                                 being collected on the driving patterns                                 when does the driver brakes are the kind                                 of accident pattern of a vehicle and                                 they want to like adjust the risk                                 premiums of the vehicle owner of the                                 driver on an on-demand basis so                                 obviously the the the iOW was not an                                 ideal platform to really land the fast                                 coming sensor data which was obviously                                 having you huge volume so so again the                                 customer came to us with prescribed in                                 the ud a solution and through the UDS                                 solution and because you da has a place                                 for data legs the customer was able to                                 like land                                 sanitize the sensor data and later                                 combine it with your relational data in                                 the warehouse to adjust their risk                                 premiums on the go so that's about it                                 i'm at the time so any questions I'd be                                 happy to take it at this point                                 no questions thank you
