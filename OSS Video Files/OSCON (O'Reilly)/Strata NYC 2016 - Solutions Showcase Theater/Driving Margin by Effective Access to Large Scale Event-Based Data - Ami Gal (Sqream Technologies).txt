	                              I'm going to talk about the real world                               use case that is addressing in a simple                               way a very large-scale event best use                               case                               and we're talking about the                               cybersecurity use case                               economy pays more than                                           dollars every year because of cyber                               security threats in average organization                                takes it takes them more than                                         to understand that they were breached                                and to do something about it that's the                                average that means that some                                organization it takes two years to                                understand that in order to locate these                                things faster and in real time you need                                to work on very large data sets so what                                we did in general with one of the                                largest telco companies across the wall                                we have them extend the way they can                                look about cyber security data we dip                                inside into this log data we are talking                                about data that comes from activities in                                users inside organization and if you can                                locate the anomalies within these                                activities early enough you can avoid                                cyber breach                                so in this case well the leader that the                                leading provider for organizations in                                this scale is the hpe oxide which                                collects all the data coming from the                                user activity and he has some issues                                with scaling data large data sets and                                understanding cyber bridge that goes                                back with a few events what we did in a                                very simple way we actually added scream                                into into the solution of HP and                                extended the capability to rock side to                                much larger scale both in time frames                                they can look at a year back instead of                                one month back or one day back of users                                events and they can also search much                                faster dr normalities that we were                                mentioning earlier right so instead of                                looking only on stuff that happened in                                the last week or month they can look a                                year back on much larger scale and                                faster one of the key challenges around                                extending the capabilities of the                                solutions inside organization is there                                is cost cost and complexity alright it                                costs a lot of money to extend storage                                and to extend service and they put more                                people that understand how to use these                                data sets and when you use scream or                                something like scream you actually save                                all that course you can just extend the                                capability of the solution you have for                                much larger data sets much faster                                so the general stuff that we did there                                after integrating with outside sees so                                we collected the data from our site in a                                much faster manner in a much larger                                scale we stored it and analyze it and of                                course d the visualization with the                                standard tool for the users we didn't                                use data scientist for that we didn't                                use a huge project or                                                 in order to implement that that was a                                simple thing straight forward to be done                                by the current users of this customer so                                how do we do that scream is the database                                that is running on GPUs a GPU is a                                graphical processing units with                                thousands of course and we are taking                                advantage of this capability in order to                                ingest and analyze much more data in                                addition to that when we collect the                                data we collect a lot of metadata on the                                data so the search are simple and                                there's no no you no need to create                                special indexes cubicles materials views                                and all the other tricks that needed to                                be done by specialized people in order                                to do that and of course because it's in                                SQL and because it's just extending the                                current solution the implementation is                                pretty fast and the users are working in                                the same way they used to work so that's                                that actually enable you to bring fast                                successes with new technologies without                                bringing more more knowledge into the                                organization this is a general                                architecture of the system you can see                                that the sources of the data users                                activities mainly inside the                                organization and it's actually outside                                that is doing all that what we did in                                order to extend the power of our                                 exciting we extended the database to                                 that so we use the standard connectivity                                 to love our site what they call smart                                 connector that's the only thing we did                                 integration                                 wise and that enable them to work on                                 much larger data sets with the same                                 technology stock they use and the                                 results are are pretty nice so before                                 extending oxide with cream they could                                 query one day back in about                                            and I don't know something like                                       minutes going back a month they couldn't                                 go and analyze users activities for the                                 last year and I wanted to emphasize why                                 this is important today cybersecurity                                 bridges and cyber security threats are                                 not based from one attack it is based                                 and comprised from multitude of events                                 usually if it's a if it's a if it's a                                 let's say not a simple cyber attack it                                 is spread across a year and six months                                 so in order to understand that you've                                 been breached you need to look at data                                 that is much more than the last week or                                 right now you need to lock way behind on                                 the abnormalities and together with                                 scream they could search much faster it                                 could be                                                             faster queries but they could also                                 search in less than a half a minute they                                 could search all the events of all the                                 users of this organization for the last                                 year and this was not possible before                                 and that enable eyes enabled them to to                                 find much more much more cyber threats                                 than they used to you can also see on                                 the standard graph this is the same                                 graph that they used before and after                                 using scream you can see that they can                                 they are actually running on much much                                 larger time frame and they're actually                                 using less less human resources in order                                 to achieve that and the most important                                 thing for them is what you see in the                                 after that you can go                                 all the way a year back and see the                                 animality this is the usual log of oxide                                 it's here just to show that it's here                                 right so again getting back to why it's                                 important to use simple methodologies in                                 order to do complex stuff when you use                                 SQL you use the same skill set that the                                 users have in order to research the data                                 and when this SQL storage and analytics                                 is capable then you achieve a lot                                 without changing the infrastructure                                 without getting into a complex project                                 and without getting new knowledge into                                 the organization that is not there so it                                 used to be very simple to do data with                                 six full server it afterwards it became                                 very simple to do data with MySQL and                                 suddenly there's a tsunami of data and                                 the tsunami of data it was great if we                                 could use SQL to do the same thing as                                 you did but you can so you're using                                 you're moving to other technologies and                                 you make a whole lot of complexity                                 around the simple query that could be                                 done with SQL so the advantage of using                                 GPU technologies around SQL analytics is                                 the fact that you can scale to hundreds                                 of terabytes without changing the logic                                 and the way you query the data and of                                 course because it's in perlita it's a it                                 takes a very short time to implement                                 into the organization and the users are                                 are happy they don't need to move to                                 something else and they don't feel                                 threatened than this it's in the safe                                 side                                 we got a boot here with the real project                                 that's running there so you can have a                                 look at the some cool stuff at boot                                     and we're looking forward to meet more                                 people to join our team or to work with                                 us thank you
