	                              my name is Roger gaskill the company is                               cognition you probably haven't heard of                               us but I'm going to talk a little bit                               about a use case that that we have that                               we think it's very interesting for this                               industry so a little bit about the                               background although you probably haven't                               heard a cog knees showing this in the in                               terms of Hadoop we're not a new entrance                                to the market we're new to the Hadoop                                market we have to have a very long and                                an extensive history in the development                                of in-memory massively parallel data                                analysis software traditionally we've                                delivered this viral answers by software                                and in the cloud but the reason we're                                here at the show is it's now available                                on Hadoop so we are currently focused on                                bringing what is unusual in this brace                                which is a very mature fully functional                                very fast supports high concurrency SQL                                interface to a Hadoop based data we can                                actually do much more than that but                                that's the current message that we're                                talking about because we think this is a                                serious issue in the Hadoop space the                                customer we're going to talk about is is                                a large well-known credit card provider                                but unfortunately they don't allow any                                vendor they don't endorse any vendor so                                we can't mention them by name but they                                are pretty recognizable by some of the                                descriptions basically they are                                recognized by most people is one of the                                most innovative credit card providers                                and they have an extensive Hadoop                                implementation and we're looking for                                ways to make that data accessible to                                their business users and allow the                                business users to continue to use their                                existing tools or new tools that are on                                the market but not specifically her do                                post tools                                so kagney show is used extensively                                within this credit card provider and                                it's used across the organization and                                it's used primarily as a in-memory                                acceleration layer primarily for Hadoop                                based data but it also can pull data                                from other systems that the the customer                                has including Netezza systems db                                 systems and Terra data the data is                                brought into memory and queries are                                accelerated and we have really in this                                particular customer become the standard                                way of interfacing business users to to                                their who do based data but I really                                want to talk about one particular use                                case in this in this particular customer                                and that is where they wanted to provide                                very sophisticated and highly detailed                                tableau dashboards to their corporate                                clients so each of their corporate                                clients who use this this credit card                                providers credit cards across the                                business would be able to analyze their                                organization spending see what people                                were were spending their expenses on so                                that was more controllable there was                                thousands of clients and they had a very                                demanding set of performance criteria                                because they wanted the clients to have                                a good user experience the data for this                                was going to be sourced from a large                                Hadoop cluster it's actually a                                  petabyte they did cluster so it's very                                large and what they wanted to avoid was                                having to create a tableau extract per                                client because initially they were going                                to write you have                                               ultimately up to                                                connecting to the system and they didn't                                want to create create extracts per                                client because you can imagine what an                                administration overhead that would                                so they wanted to put in a single data                                source that was capable of supplying all                                of or capable of allowing them to run                                all of the queries they needed to do to                                render all of these dashboards for                                                                                                  single source and as you can mention                                that was produced very heavy throughput                                requirements on that particular platform                                that was going to that it was                                       clients the concurrency levels were                                going to be high                                                        for the                                                               seeing data that was only relevant to                                 themselves and the platform that's                                 fighting this data needed to be able to                                 make sure that only that data that was                                 relevant to the client would be seen                                 their dashboards were were very complex                                 and actually resulted in some in excess                                 of a hundred queries to render each                                 dashboard so at many tabs that the                                 client could look at and the whole thing                                 had to appear on the desktop within                                 seven seconds of them saying they wanted                                 to see the dashboard and they had an SLA                                 which says the whole render would would                                 take less than seven seconds subsequent                                 drill downs into the dashboard would                                 have to be sub second so this is                                 actually a massive query workload for a                                 back-end system if you if you do the                                 mathematics on that so the solution we                                 put in price for them was a cognition                                 instance it was configured with five                                 terabytes of active memory                                               and the system could nishio allows and                                 them to set it up so it seamlessly sucks                                 the data out of HDFS into the RAM at                                 high speed so the data could be very                                 regularly updated and the platform                                 currently is delivering about                                       queries per second tableau type                                 analytical queries about                                           second and can support                                              sessions running concurrently so                                     dashboard renders not                                                basically initial Ren                                 the dashboard it can do                                                  and within the SLA where are achieving                                 ninety-eight percent of the dashboards                                 rendered in under four seconds so huge                                 query look world words the key thing                                 about this is this is a scalable                                 solution so at the moment they have it                                 configured with five terabytes and RAM                                 and                                                                   course you can get more throughput and                                 if you add more memory you can get a                                 larger data capacity and cognition I                                 limit sin terms of the scalability we                                 can run to thousands of servers and tens                                 of thousands of course so this is a                                 relatively small instance for us but we                                 think it's a good example of what can be                                 achieved and I don't think it's widely                                 accepted today that you can have very                                 high concurrent usage of Hadoop based                                 data without putting in another another                                 machine in the way but the cognition                                 offed where allows this particular                                 client to get these very very high                                 levels which I think are pretty much                                 unseen in the industry so that's                                 basically the use case if you'd like to                                 know a little bit more and maybe                                 understood more about by the client                                 because unfortunately I can't talk                                 directly about their name then we're at                                 booth                                                                  where you can actually download the                                 software completely for free there's no                                 charge for the software it's free                                 software and so we suggest you go try it                                 and see if you can achieve the same                                 results as we did at this particular                                 this particular customer ok kick                                 you
