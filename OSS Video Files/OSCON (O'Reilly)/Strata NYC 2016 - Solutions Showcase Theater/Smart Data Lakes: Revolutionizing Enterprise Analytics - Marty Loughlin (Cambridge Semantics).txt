	                              good morning thank you for taking the                               time to join us this morning my name is                               Marty lachlan vice president of                               financial services at Cambridge                               semantics were a software company in                               Boston and we have a very unique                               approach to the data Lake we call the                               smart data lake and we're going to take                               a few minutes to talk about that so I                                realized where the last presentation                                before lunch so we should probably keep                                this short but really not that short the                                point here is that what we really want                                to be able to do in the enterprise is                                enable our business users to have access                                to all of the enterprise data in a way                                that they can ask any question they want                                of that data without having to go back                                to the IT for more access or more                                capabilities ask any question a very                                complex data and so we say any question                                we're talkin these are some examples of                                the kinds of questions that we're                                helping our customers answer so ranges                                from understanding if you think back to                                the crisis of                                                           what's my exposure to Lehman that's a                                very complex problem to answer for large                                organizations through questions like                                what's the best investigator to use for                                a phase                                                           injectable liver drug anywhere in the                                world so the characteristic of these                                questions is that they require the                                harmonization of data across many                                diverse and large data sets and they                                also require us to be able to answer                                questions that we don't necessarily know                                in advance so our approach to this is as                                we think about the enterprise landscape                                today we think of it as a puzzle the                                your data is residing in many disparate                                databases many disparate sources and                                it's pretty difficult to ask questions                                that span those data sources we can                                bring a couple together we can bring                                maybe three together and the current bi                                tools but to go beyond that is very                                challenging and it Cambridge semantics                                what we're doing is helping you bring                                all of your enterprise data together                                with a common harmonized meaning and a                                way to access all of that data without                                having to worry about data integration                                so as a business user I can now view the                                data in many different ways ask                                different questions that span many parts                                of that data without having to worry                                about where that data came from or                                to join it together of course the beauty                                of this is if you think about any puzzle                                you don't know what the pieces are                                missing until you get to the end of the                                puzzle the same applies when you apply a                                model to your data and bring it all                                together you can suddenly identify where                                the gaps are and use that as a way to                                tap into new data sources to fill in the                                picture so how do we do this so our                                platform is based on semantic web                                technology we use models to describe                                data high-level business conceptual                                models and we build those across all                                kinds of data sources so for example if                                you think about a traditional relational                                data source that has rows and columns we                                can represent that as a graph as an                                entity and its relationships and                                properties we can do this for                                unstructured data too so we have natural                                language processing capabilities that                                identify entities and concepts and                                sentiments in text and we can extend the                                graph with anything that we extract from                                those sources this also applies to other                                kinds of data sources enterprise systems                                that may have structured and                                unstructured data we can extend the                                graph with data extracted from those                                systems also and so what we're doing is                                building a representation of the data                                that's expressed in high-level business                                conceptual terms that spans all of the                                different data sources that were brought                                together but isn't tied to the physical                                representation of any of them we can                                extend this model easily and we can now                                ask questions that span many hops in the                                model so we can ask a question about a                                 company's market cap and how that                                 relates to safety signals that may be                                 captured in a note and think about doing                                 that in a relational world that requires                                 joins across many complex data sets you                                 can do it but it requires sophisticated                                 programmers and developers to do that                                 our tools allow you to build queries                                 using a visual query builder to access                                 this kind of data so the model that we                                 use this is an example from the farmer                                 life science space that model that we                                 use to harmonize those different data                                 sources is also the model that we use to                                 provide users access to the data so you                                 can build dashboards visualization                                 search analytics filtering all driven by                                 the model these dashboards are graph                                 aware and this is the power of being                                 able to ask questions that you didn't                                 necessarily know in advance you can                                 infer relationships you can construct                                 new data through these dashboards and                                 bill                                 views that as I said answer questions                                 that were not anticipated in advance so                                 how do we do that we have a very                                 scalable platform we've been developing                                 it since                                                                company came out of IBM we're working on                                 it semantic web technology they're                                 building a toolset that allows us to do                                 all of what I've described end-to-end                                 without writing any code so this is                                 business analysts and business user                                 capabilities and we can do it at scale                                 and we do that through a couple of                                 different approaches so in this picture                                 this is our sort of end-to-end                                 architecture the middle there is the                                 storage layer we sit on top of almost                                 any kind of storage platform so we                                 leverage Hadoop HDFS we sit on top of                                 Amazon's s                                                           Google's cloud platform we're                                 independent of the storage itself and                                 our tools on the bottom layer this data                                 Lake server allows you to prepare data                                 for storage in the lake we have tools                                 that catalog data sources capture                                 configurable metadata and assistive                                 business analyst mapping those sources                                 sources onto the common semantic model                                 we do that for structured and                                 unstructured data we ship with natural                                 language processing and text analytics                                 capabilities but more importantly we                                 have a framework that you can plug in                                 third-party tools so if you're using                                 lingua maddox or lex oolitic sore and it                                 will anyone of other                                                   work on unstructured content we can take                                 the output of that and harmonize with                                 the graph so that you can do analytics                                 across combine structured and                                 unstructured content once you have the                                 data in the lake there are ways for end                                 users on the top layer to browse the                                 available datasets we call this Smart                                 Data discovery browse the available                                 datasets in the lake select the ones                                 that they are interested in and load                                 them into memory and this is really the                                 secret sauce in terms of our ability to                                 scale this platform if you know anything                                 about semantic web technology it's been                                 around a long time it's very powerful                                 but as a performance overhead in terms                                 of being able to do interactive queries                                 we've solved that problem with this                                 technology so the graph query engine is                                 a massively parallel in memory semantic                                 data standard compliant graph database                                 we have it running on                                              Google's cloud platform at the moment                                 we're about to complete a one trillion                                 triple benchmark and we're going to blow                                 the socks off the last one so                                 what that enables us to do is to                                 interactive query and analytics all of                                 the things that our dashboards support                                 at a very large scale so when you think                                 about the smart data lake and why would                                 you leverage a platform like this we                                 think along two dimensions one is the                                 number of data sources from few too many                                 and the other is a number of data sets                                 from few too many are from small to                                 large I'm sorry and so for we can handle                                 simple data we can handle small data                                 sets we can handle big data sets that                                 are simple in structure but that's not                                 really our sweet spot our sweet spot is                                 really when you've got multiple data                                 sources very diverse data of different                                 entity types where you want to ask                                 questions that span across those                                 entities and data sets and we can do                                 that for complex data at very large                                 scale if you're interested in learning a                                 little bit more about what we do you                                 want to see a demo of either the data                                 ingestion and smart data linked server                                 component of the platform or all the way                                 through to use cases that we've applied                                 this technology to in financial services                                 and life science we're at buddh                                         we welcome you over for a demo thank you                                 for your attention
