Title: Fly the airplane - Kristopher Beevers (NS1)
Publication date: 2017-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	During active operational incidents, we experience very human reactions that get in the way of resolution. Approaches like Incident Command provide solid foundations for incident response. Kristopher Beevers explains how to augment Incident Command with simple tools and processes that help your team focus, communicate effectively, and respond calmly and precisely during mission-critical events.

	00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,910
everybody I'm Chris I'm the CEO at ns1

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,599
the DNS and traffic management company

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,219
were based right here in New York just

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,420
gonna take a few minutes this morning to

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:16,789
talk about everybody's favorite topic

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,400
Incident Response pretty commonly in our

00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:22,070
community we're talking about

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,109
organizational models or technology for

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,640
men and managing incidents on that ennis

00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,990
one we use an incident command model and

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,269
if that's not a familiar idea to

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,160
everybody I'm not going to talk about it

00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,989
today but I strongly suggest googling

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,640
incident command and watching in

00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:36,910
particular some of the talks by fastly

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,800
on this topic they're really great talks

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,070
we of course use the usual array of like

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,329
monitoring and alerting and logging and

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,500
mitigation other tools anytime we have

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,820
an incident that's not what I want to

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,579
talk about either instead I want to talk

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,949
just for a couple minutes about

00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:54,050
practices we've found a-10s one to make

00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:55,699
sure that when we are responding to an

00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,649
active incident we're making use of our

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,280
organizational design and our processes

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,440
and our tools as effectively as possible

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,210
so here's an example of one of my very

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,979
favorite tools for effective effective

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,590
Incident Response this is a checklist

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:12,470
and as an aside the the tweeter here

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,510
calm he's at AWS he's led engineering on

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,280
cloud front and on route 53 and a lot of

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,070
other projects there's a checklist he

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,470
made to help his operators at AWS be

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,630
better at Incident Response and I'm not

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,890
so focused on the content here yet more

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,590
in the form right this is a checklist

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,670
it's simple focused concise easy to

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,710
understand it's only got the most

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,479
important or salient points it's not

00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,880
over prescriptive it's meant to be used

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,130
by someone experienced with the system

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,750
that they're operating checklists are a

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,130
great tool for Incident Response because

00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,560
they give you cues they give the

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,659
operator cues that remind them of

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,189
experience they already have or training

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,909
they've been through help the operator

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:53,020
avoid forgetting key steps or details in

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:55,880
some kind of an active incident scenario

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,829
just as an aside to focus on the content

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,899
for a second this this point here focus

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,670
on mitigation and not root cause this is

00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:04,009
a great point in any kind of incident

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,930
response scenario pretty commonly as

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,750
engineers right when we're mitigating an

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,879
active situation we can get sidetracked

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,560
by diagnosis and wanting to really

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,670
understand like what's happened why is

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,590
it happening what was the root cause

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,090
sometimes it's the wrong thing to do in

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,459
their service impact we should focus on

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,530
that service impact and worry about root

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,500
cause analysis and and diagnosis later

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,480
on this idea shows up in all kinds of

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,030
checklists this is one of my favorite

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,080
checklist this is this is the Cessna

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,370
172s emergency procedures checklist for

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,810
engine failure during flight so you're

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,110
flying your cessna along the engine

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,670
stops um and a really common problem in

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,340
this scenario hopefully it doesn't

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,600
happen that commonly right but what what

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,910
does happen in this scenario is the

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,250
pilot can get so overwhelmed by the

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,690
situation and so focused on why is my

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,980
engine stopped how do I get it started

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,560
again that they take their hands off the

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,130
yoke and the airplane stop staying level

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,110
so thus this this big bold step step two

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,330
in the checklist fly the airplane to

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,519
remind the operator of the system to

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,950
keep flying the airplane so good

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,959
checklist is simple it's short it's not

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,360
too specific it's meant to be used by an

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,160
experienced operator limited it just the

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,200
most important actions for that operator

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,850
to be taking it's there to help them

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,250
execute those actions and I'm gonna talk

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,100
anymore about checklists but I'd

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,870
recommend this book by a tool go on it's

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,130
a great book about checklists and what

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,680
makes a good checklist it's not

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,140
specifically about Incident Response in

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,940
like the tech ops context it's actually

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,370
about a surgical use case but there's a

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,610
lot of great lessons there for us um

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,650
another important tool a tennis one so

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,329
we have we can have the best

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,250
organizational design in the world we

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,750
can have great tools great tech great

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,450
checklists how do we get really good at

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,079
using them practice makes perfect so

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,299
this is a picture of a fire drill at the

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,239
wano zoo in Japan for a situation where

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,430
a tiger has escaped its cage the idea of

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,100
a fire drill is really important to make

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,470
sure that as an organization we react

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,850
effectively when some sort of active

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,019
incident arises in in reality there's a

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,090
tool that most of us in our community

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,680
known of have talked about for a long

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,229
time that helps us create fire drill

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,209
situations chaos monkey is actively

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,190
breaks components of our systems in

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,979
production and we found it on this one

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,120
there some kinds of situations with a

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,370
little bit more of a human element

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,380
required to create a good scenario so

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,920
one of those situations we deal with

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,200
a tennis one is DDoS attack we get

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,880
attacked we're a target frequently how

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,020
do we get really great at handling those

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,060
sorts of situations

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,460
well fire drills are what we actually

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,220
call war game exercises this is a screen

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,250
cap of a bunch of our engineering team

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,930
on the defense huddled in the conference

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,420
room defending against a DDoS attack and

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,830
that DDoS attack is not a real-world one

00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,770
it's one that's perpetrated by other

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,990
folks in our team you know like a war

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,330
game scenario or red red blue scenario

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,070
and literally when we do these fire

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,200
drills we attack our production

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,050
infrastructure with real traffic real

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,370
tools in fact I would say at ns1 we

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,500
probably build some of the best tools

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,150
out there for attacking DNS

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,450
infrastructure they're not open-source

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,430
and they're not for sale

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,800
we've learned a lot about how to run

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,690
effective wargames or fire drills like

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,010
this just a couple quick lessons I mean

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,750
most importantly don't fake it we've

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,330
learned that doing real attacks against

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,920
our infrastructure help us understand

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,600
the dynamics of our systems they help

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,430
our individuals and our teams build

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,530
muscle memory around how to react

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,440
effectively we also find that these are

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,240
great tools for team building it's

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,370
almost like you know running a scrimmage

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,070
for your football team or your soccer

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,480
team right it's a fun exercise helps

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,830
everybody understand how they can work

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,400
together and contribute in a real-world

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,780
situation just as a quick advertisement

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,180
if any of you happen to be flying across

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,070
a pawn pawn to another velocity later

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,360
this month in London our director

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,750
technology Shannon is giving a

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,120
full-length top talk on this topic the

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,510
last thing and then I'm done is this

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,190
notion of post-mortem analysis so really

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,050
important to do post-mortem or

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,720
retroactive analysis after real event

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,460
events or incidents after fire drills

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,980
and ask a few questions what happened

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,990
what could we have done better what

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,580
worked really well take the answers to

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,590
those questions and feed them back into

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,780
of course your organizational design

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,940
your tools your technology and also your

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,010
checklists and your fire drills creating

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,220
that feedback loop helps us improve

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:36,350
every time some real or simulated

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,410
incident happens thanks everybody

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,410
