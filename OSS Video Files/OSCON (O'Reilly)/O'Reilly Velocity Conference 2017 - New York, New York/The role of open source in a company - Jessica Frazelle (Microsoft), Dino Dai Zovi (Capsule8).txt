you can tell why the black hoodie that

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,180
I'm wearing that I'm a security guy so I

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,920
really care a lot about secret sauce I

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,980
sort of think that every every line of

00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,769
code that I write a secret sauce I'm

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,009
sure you might know the type but so what

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,289
we say you have a successful open source

00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,730
project and it takes off like wildfire

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,050
and you're managing this community that

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,060
is sort of like managing a large

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,830
engineering department of people who

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,160
kind of come and go at their at their

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,029
choosing which sounds a lot harder than

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,669
even managing a normal engineering

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,680
department you have to worry if are you

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,719
giving away too much because if you're

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,800
you know starting if you're at a company

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,949
you have to make sure that there's still

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,949
some value of what your customers would

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:46,980
be or are paying you for and it's very

00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:48,899
common also for us to confuse kind of

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,280
our product for the software artifact

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,410
and I think a lot of people in this room

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,239
know that you know open source projects

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,410
that we use sort of read a and don't

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,570
even really think about that there's a

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,039
thing that's not open source often it's

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,629
just because that's a more useful way to

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,300
use it it's more malleable it's more

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,040
flexible it lets us just works with all

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,470
the things that we need to do and it

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,200
speeds up that iteration cycle of the

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,230
feedback from what is needed to solve

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,070
the job and and what the tool should do

00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,020
but there's so there's you have to make

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,720
sure that you're still preserving the

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,090
value of the service the commercial

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,990
service or product and for us and kind

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,680
of security'll and

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,470
our subject matter expertise is you know

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,480
core to that value so make sure that

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,550
there's still something there you also

00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,670
have to think about commoditization so

00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,850
for instance it's a common worry to say

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,290
are we commoditizing ourselves like are

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,570
you I'm making ourselves on this theory

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,780
but maybe what's happening is that the

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,560
world is commoditizing you anyway that

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,910
what your product is is becoming just

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,680
you know freely available and there's

00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,880
many choices so for instance now many

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,560
people think about selling UNIX

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,880
operating system anymore but I remember

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,170
when there are so many to choose from

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,520
from different vendors and now there's

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,930
really not and so the those so that's

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,340
what you need to think about but the

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,640
going back to the secret and secret

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,340
sauce your secret isn't all that secret

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,590
so going into some of the kind of

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,090
nerd stuff as you can see we got a also

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,569
a black screen so we're talking about

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,900
security stuff you know I know I know

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:27,150
our type so the secrets in your source

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,099
code are really not all that secret and

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,080
with people a lot of software engineers

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,459
think about how do people go about

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,870
reverse engineering they think about the

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,450
tools that they know they think about oh

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,370
maybe you just used you know objdump and

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,540
just read the assembly and yeah I think

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,980
you can figure something out from there

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,019
but it's really complicated and

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,550
time-consuming but then you look at like

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,599
the tools that are being built and

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,170
people are using for capture-the-flag

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,370
competitions and people are using for

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,069
actually everything up to like car

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,260
modifications it'll rebuild the call

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,180
graph and function control graphs inside

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,370
of the software and allow you to

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,040
interactively rename functions and

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,860
rename variables and then even have an

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,140
interactive decomp decompiler so you can

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,790
manually teach the compiler more

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,650
information about the software and get

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,680
very readable source code out of it so

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,000
the only thing that you really is really

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,600
secret once you've released a binary

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,769
into the world are the comments and we

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,840
all know that all the code that we write

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:27,030
has plenty of accurate comments anyway

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,850
so there's it's not really much left so

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,160
I encourage people to not worry as much

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,870
about the secret sauce and I've but I've

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,680
you know been on both sides of this and

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,170
this is actually kind of I've been a

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,060
transformation for me because I wasn't

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,250
maybe three years ago I was at square

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,250
and we decided to open source key with

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,810
our secrets management system and I was

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,700
literally I think the only person was

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,069
like wait the thing where we put all our

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,660
secrets you want me want to give that

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,819
away tell people one where all the

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,980
secrets are and to how it works

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,459
are we sure about this all right cuz

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,170
that but it was fine it was great and so

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,030
sometimes you have to go go you know

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,290
through those periods of hesitation and

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,480
actually really think about it from a

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,650
larger sense and worried that we realize

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,060
that your secrets aren't all that secret

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,329
it's not a big deal you'll actually gain

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,870
a lot from that process rather than

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:14,870
