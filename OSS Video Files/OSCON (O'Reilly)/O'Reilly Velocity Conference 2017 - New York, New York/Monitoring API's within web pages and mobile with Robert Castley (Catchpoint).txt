hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,319
velocity in New York City I'm here with

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,359
Robert from catch point Robert how you

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,740
doing I'm good say yourself good so

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,070
how's this event been for you this week

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,769
this has been really successful and busy

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,540
and down on the booth we've had loads of

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,220
people stopping by I think mainly for

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,140
the water bottles because the little

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,090
cups that they're like espresso sized

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,250
this year and to drink wonderful yeah

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,170
and so the water bottles been really

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,720
successful excellent actually

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,949
so can you catch me up on what you guys

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,710
have been doing at catch point for the

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,440
last six months sure so we've been

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,380
making great efforts and strides into

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,270
trying to help people triage and

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,430
troubleshoot issues from a synthetic

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,620
monitoring standpoint and a real user

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,129
monitoring standpoint to make it a lot

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,020
easier and we started this concept of

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,539
what we call guided analytics where

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,789
we're actually doing the hard work for

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,280
our customers on the back end so we can

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,440
present visualizations in the data that

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,739
are more easily consumable and also

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,400
takes a lot less time to visualize you

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,080
know within our SAS portal so you do

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,250
both rum and synthetic yes and you

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,900
talked a little bit about what is

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:16,110
synthetic sure so synthetic is basic

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,670
like an automated test that is set up by

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,650
the user so just go and hit a webpage do

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,680
a transaction where we can simulate a

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,780
user transaction in a web application

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,270
whether it's an API test so we're

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,939
testing API is DNS test for like DDoS

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,340
detection or DNS spoofing right the way

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,920
through to more recent test types of

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,200
integers like WebSockets and MQTT for

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
the Internet of Things so what's the

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,700
most popular question in that sort of

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,640
testing is it yes or is it something

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,170
else it's it again it kind of depends on

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,130
the vertical but we're seeing more and

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,950
more API is becoming a more key

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,719
monitoring requirement because people

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,579
are building out as you know web

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,799
applications now that rely heavily on

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,860
getting information from disparate

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,090
sources so instead of just testing the

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,640
whole webpage that's going to tell you

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,929
you know if it's up is it fast is it

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,019
doing what you want but

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,239
by being able to monitor key api's and

00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:18,870
monitor them frequently you can detect

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,090
issues before you know they happen using

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,670
the API so the more companies that are

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,920
trying to expose API yeah their

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,060
ecosystem exactly more than ever going

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,069
to need someone that catch point yet to

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,720
help them figure out if it's working yep

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,939
and it's becoming I mean it's not just

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,920
api's within websites it's like even

00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:38,370
smartphone applications rely heavily

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,760
upon api's and to test from a physical

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,889
device is is inherently expensive but by

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,560
extracting the API calls of that mobile

00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:49,409
application is making you can monitor

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,620
that very very cheaply using an API and

00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,879
is mobile the biggest part of like what

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,659
people are trying to measure and monitor

00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,700
it again it varies on the vessel I mean

00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,409
when it comes to mobile apps everybody

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,909
likes to have a mobile app but as well

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,829
you know if we would pull out our smart

00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,659
phones now we've probably got similar

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,609
apps on there you know and they're the

00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,010
de facto ones that people tend to go to

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,980
but yes people are you know wanting to

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,239
monitor their mobile applications api's

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,280
again it's it could be like if you take

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,709
like sports betting sites they're

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,379
pulling in information and live data

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,000
from all over the place so again on a

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,099
site like that it's absolutely critical

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,120
or music say snakes modified that are

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,129
predicting what you want

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,930
yes well yeah yeah so are you guys gonna

00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,519
go down the predictive model as well are

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,359
you trying to predict where you're gonna

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,150
be monitoring and measuring people so

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:44,489
wait with with the whole saw like trying

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,549
to predict what people are wanting to

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,159
monitor we're actually going I guess

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,750
like a step further because people are

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,310
wanting to monitor all different kinds

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,079
of things so we're seeing the whole lots

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,299
of like container space you know the

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,819
microservices space and people are gonna

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,199
start wanting to you know monitor them

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,709
just like they've been monitoring their

00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,440
webpages and not only that that they

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,720
they want to be able to understand every

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,400
key part of you know their

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,109
infrastructure and how well it is

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,859
performing and like I said we've

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:16,949
introduced

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:20,039
mqtt as a test type and we'll continue

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,810
to add you know new test types to our

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,090
platform to meet the needs of our and

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,270
you

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,820
so do you guys then monitor throughout a

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,790
whole application architecture inside

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,320
we're not when you when you're actually

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,850
looking at the architects you you sort

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,350
of like looking at the APM space the

00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,460
application performance monitoring space

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:42,160
we today are exclusively external so we

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,229
don't you to use our solution you don't

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,840
need to install anything you know on the

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,240
back end we come at it from the front

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,050
end yeah from the front end but saying

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,060
that we have a feature within our

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,790
platform called insights which allows

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,979
users to expose information that

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,530
wouldn't normally be available just by

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,660
requesting you know an API call or

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,479
requesting a web page they can

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,910
externalize data to us it might be an

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,430
SQL query time it might be the name of

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,910
the server that gave us the the web page

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,740
or the the API call and by taking that

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,039
sorta like what we call custom metric

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,750
allows them to get even better insight

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,810
as to what's going on so without being

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,729
intrusive we can actually yeah we can

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,639
get into the application but it requires

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,160
our customers to expose that information

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,860
to us and in expose it just to you it's

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,289
not like exposed on the Internet well it

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,270
kind of is because it's we have to get

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:41,919
it out the headers although the content

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,410
body of the page but it's not sensitive

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,389
data per se you know I mean it can

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,010
depends how they code it I mean they

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,260
might just call it server a server being

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,360
server C but they're not gonna give us

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,580
an IP address or anything that's can

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,020
compromise them in any way and you'll be

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,669
surprised as the number of websites that

00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,260
you go to and sometimes if you scroll

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,669
right down to the very bottom there'll

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,389
be something in the footer that says

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:06,430
it's like AMW web 0-1 they're already

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,160
doing it a lot of people - okay for

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,780
measurement yeah oh yeah okay so Robert

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,389
if you and I sat down twelve months from

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,669
now mm-hmm we have this discussion yep

00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,840
what will change for catch point and

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:20,620
what would you like to see changed in

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,500
the industry in general so I as you know

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,389
everything is going to the cloud and you

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,039
know everybody's moving you know that

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,039
the big buzz at the moment is micro

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,530
services and containers and it's almost

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,450
like chaotic out there because people

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,790
are just spinning

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,100
you know microservices and containers

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,930
there there is like almost sometimes it

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,150
feels like there's no control over this

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,400
so you know where we will be going is

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,640
obviously into the helping people

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,830
monitor in in that space as well because

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,870
that's obviously a key growth area you

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,790
know not just from the container

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,400
providers but from the management of

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,110
containers but also to the monitoring of

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,300
those containers and ensuring you know

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,890
that they're up there performing well

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,750
right and they're doing what they're

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,160
supposed to be doing yeah excellent

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,720
Robert we look forward to that

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,020
conversation excellent thank you for

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,020
having me

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,940
