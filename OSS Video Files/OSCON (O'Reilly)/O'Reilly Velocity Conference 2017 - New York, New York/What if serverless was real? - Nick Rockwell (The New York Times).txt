	00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,660
I think there's a lot of psychological

00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,130
resistance to serverless and I was

00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,780
thinking about this and I was thinking

00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,330
that like architecture is really is

00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,580
weird and it brings up a lot of weird

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,320
issues like do I feel secure in my

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,090
environment how do I feel about

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,650
authority figure it's like Google and

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,690
Amazon how do I feel about commitment

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,980
like all this stuff and I I think most

00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,690
like software architecture they all have

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,400
therapists they should be forced out of

00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,440
therapists by their you know their

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,080
companies because it's it's pretty deep

00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,000
stuff so but what we see is like

00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,489
engineering managers in particular tend

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,469
to be very conservative you know we can

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:38,019
be wary of something like this anything

00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:40,059
hyped kind of gets us feeling like

00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:42,159
critical and skeptical and negative so

00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,929
that puts us on edge there is an

00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,579
existential threat or it feels like an

00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,620
existential threat to many people here

00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:50,890
depending on what you do you know

00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,899
serverless threatens to like obviate or

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,760
change radically at least the kind of

00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,440
career trajectory that you're on and

00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,249
then there's the perception of control

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,780
so I spoke a lot with Mike Roberts

00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:04,059
before this talk who wrote the

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,350
serverless blog post on the martyr site

00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,329
any Navi runs a consulting company

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,829
called symphonia and he he says the

00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,329
number one reaction he gets from people

00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,450
is like what are we giving up to do this

00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:14,920
so it's not what what can I do like what

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,899
am i gaining it's like what am i giving

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,229
up and there's a bias towards control

00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:21,939
that we we run into weirder resistances

00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:24,369
and this is mostly stuff that maybe just

00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,930
goes through my head but for a long time

00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:27,759
I had to overcome the idea that like

00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,799
it's not possible like serverless is too

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,570
good to be true it's like The Economist

00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,680
seeing $20 on the sidewalk and not

00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,149
picking it up because it's impossible

00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,340
for it to be lying there in a busy

00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:38,020
street then there's the idea of

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,789
scientific reticence and this is like

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,159
when you talk to the people who know the

00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:44,259
most who are the smartest they tend to

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,369
be very rational and very balanced and

00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,899
they're like well there's pros and

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,250
there's cons is the experience I have

00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,840
talking to some of my lead engineers you

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,520
know it's good things and bad things and

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,929
here the problems and then I kind of say

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,950
like but it's amazing right and they're

00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:58,390
like yeah it's amazing yeah you know and

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,520
then there's the problem of the black

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,380
hole of enterprise value and I think

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,390
like if you're a startup and you're a

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,570
SAS company or you do anything involving

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,849
infrastructure if you know to the extent

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,110
that serverless happens a whole bunch of

00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,730
the value you're creating just went away

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,860
like you're not actually going to be

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,209
able to do a better job

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,209
managing the infrastructure for your SAS

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,010
platform than Amazon or Google so what

00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,840
do you do - you just leverage their

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,310
platforms and then you're not doing very

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,930
much anymore you're like doing this much

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,040
instead of this button like you're not

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,510
gonna get the valuation that you were

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,720
looking for so that seems like a problem

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,540
and then there's a leaky abstraction the

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,069
fun of leaky abstractions so again when

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,540
you dangle something like serverless in

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,709
front of smart engineers the first thing

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,450
they want to do is like find the leaks

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,120
they like want to find the leaks and

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,920
poke holes in it and like in I do really

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,910
good spots but but on the other hand the

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,560
kind of sets you on the wrong mindset

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,100
sometimes it's important but but it's

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,480
too it's too fun so so what is you know

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,430
what is serverless not from

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,900
architectural perspective serverless is

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,180
not functions that's just one

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,260
implementation it's not events reactive

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,730
computing is great but that's not what

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,730
we're talking about I didn't say those

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,500
two things that was or in Tyco the X GM

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,900
of Heroku is now a product manager at

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,910
Google for serverless stuff he said

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,530
those things so you can't argue with

00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,290
those okay everything else you can argue

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,610
about it's also not statelessness that's

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,549
not what this is about and it's not

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,230
about simple you hear a lot services

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,440
okay for simple stuff but for complex

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,720
applications it's not actually another

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,500
guy that I spoke to Deepak Singh who

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,600
runs CCS at Amazon said that he called

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,640
he said I call lambda modern-day pearl

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,709
and I kind of like that cuz I'm a little

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,180
pearl person and I left pearl but it

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,560
sort of betrays a little bit of that

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,299
mindset of like okay we can use

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,650
serverless for like a little glue or

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,269
like here and there or simple stuff but

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,140
I don't think there's any fundamental

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,140
