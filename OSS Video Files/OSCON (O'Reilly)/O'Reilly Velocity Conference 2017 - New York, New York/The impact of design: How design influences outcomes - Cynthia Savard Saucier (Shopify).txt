Title: The impact of design: How design influences outcomes - Cynthia Savard Saucier (Shopify)
Publication date: 2017-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	We like to think that technology can make the world a better place, but we (conveniently) forget how it can make it worse. Primum non nocere (first do no harm) is the first concept taught in medical school, serving as a reminder of the possible harm that any intervention might do. Cynthia Savard Saucier challenges the tech industry to come up with its own fundamental principle.

	00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:06,019
so developers are responsible for the

00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,650
code and designers are responsible for

00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:12,259
the users is that right

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,150
well no contrary to popular belief

00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:16,430
designers and developers have a very

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,120
similar job they are both responsible

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,040
for solving problems for their users so

00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,260
consequently the existence of a user

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,330
experience designer on the team does not

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,480
mean that developers are not accountable

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,970
for the users while being developers

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,249
make design decisions daily and they

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,199
they have a significant impact on the

00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:39,760
experience but that impact is not always

00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:42,649
obvious error messages instructions

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,719
validations edge cases exceptions

00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,399
handling accessibility and performance

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,359
are all things that I've been designed

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,149
but oftentimes not by the designer so

00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,219
good news were all designers but bad

00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:59,210
news the decisions that we make daily

00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:01,940
have real-life consequences bad design

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,339
decisions can harm anger infuriate

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,880
exclude caused injustice and even kill

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:10,070
users in medical school the first thing

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,939
that students are taught is primum non

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,079
nocere

00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:17,360
or in english first do no harm this

00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,340
immediately reinforces the fact that as

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,149
a physician you have a lot of power on a

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,210
person's life

00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:25,039
by contrast the first thing that I was

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,619
taught in design school was how to draw

00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:29,060
in 3d and I've been told that some

00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,250
developers the first thing they they

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,299
thought and they learned in school was

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,280
binary code and if they were lucky they

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,570
had a single 3-hour long class on user

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,520
experience and the teacher probably

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:44,570
called this human-computer interaction

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,359
but don't worry I did a four year

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,929
program in design without ever seeing

00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,850
the word UX the problem is that we are

00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,770
not taught in school that design has a

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,520
power to shape technology and the world

00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,429
we live in

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,689
and as spider-man's Uncle Ben would tell

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:01,090
us with great power comes great

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,170
responsibility

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,840
so here's one thing we're not taught in

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,569
school bad design decision can kill and

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,360
I mean that not in a metaphorical way

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,519
like next time I see a comic poster I

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,780
might kill myself or a kitten or any

00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:18,980
other variation

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,690
this I mean it in a very real way so in

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,209
our office we have a wiki page that

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,650
outlines the emergency procedures and in

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,940
it we learned that there are two types

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,490
of alarms if there was to be an

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,040
emergency the first alarm

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,959
we're told will tell you that you should

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,459
be prepared to evacuate if there is

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,920
something but you don't need to leave

00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,720
the office right now right away the

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,280
second time the second type of alarm

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,690
tells you that you should evacuate right

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,530
now so we're gonna do a little test

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:48,470
don't evacuate but I'm gonna play one of

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,290
the two alarms and by a show of hand

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,400
tell me if you would just prepare your

00:02:51,290 --> 00:03:04,030
things or if you would leave the

00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:06,739
building so would you leave the building

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,950
Wow I'm sorry to say most of you would

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:12,739
have died right now so this is obviously

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,870
a very terrible sound design solution

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,850
but there are other ways that by design

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,720
decisions in kill and this is what

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,640
happened on April April 10 2014 a

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,519
stranger had been trying to crawl into a

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,290
woman's house he tried the windows and

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,940
the doors and when he finally made it

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,860
crawl into the living room the woman

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,030
grabbed a kitchen knife and scared him

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,620
away no one died so you must wonder like

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,209
if the woman heard the guy trying to

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,970
come into our house why didn't she call

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:44,269
the police well she did she actually

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:48,290
died 9-1-1 37 times that day but it was

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:50,900
always busy for six hours that 9:00 that

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,500
that night the entire population of

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,670
washington and no emergency service in

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,680
that house no one was injured but a 40

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,170
year old man called marlon summary be'

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,489
was not as lucky when he collapsed that

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,850
night and his father realized

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,320
immediately called 9-1-1

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,030
it wasn't really lucky obviously got a

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,040
busy signal so he went to his neighbor's

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,640
and asked his friends and family to call

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,250
9-1-1 for them but it didn't work and a

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,690
man unfortunately died from a medical

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,370
condition that would have been easily

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:27,690
treatable and he reached the hospital on

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:31,530
time so what caused that outage

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,560
was it a bad software update or patch no

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,690
was it a cyberattack not at all it was

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,030
actually very simple design mistake and

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,940
when we learn about these mistakes

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,950
it's easy to cast blame but these

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,170
designers and developers working on

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,700
these software's are really no different

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,340
than you and me they're not better and

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,200
they're not worse so traditionally when

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,030
we study design mistakes for example why

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,700
a bridge would collapse or a plane would

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,160
crash we would try to identify the

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,720
weakest link the thing that caused the

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,690
whole thing to break but software

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:09,210
doesn't break the reason this software

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,570
failed is that it was designed to do the

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,190
wrong thing so at one point the

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,730
programmer working for Intrado

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,350
the faulty server system provider he had

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,820
to set a threshold on how many calls

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,500
could be uniquely identified before

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,500
being dispatched all around the country

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,140
that threshold was arbitrary set at 40

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,600
millions so when the counter exceeded

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,770
that number on April 10 all new calls

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,680
were rejected because it couldn't be

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,260
identified resulting in busy signals for

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,930
every one that was a failure of

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,440
imagination no one imagined that they

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,300
would reach that number so the complex

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,700
system we are building manages part of

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,560
our lives are way more vital than ever

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,020
therefore it's important to plan for

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,190
what we can't see to design for a wide

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,190
