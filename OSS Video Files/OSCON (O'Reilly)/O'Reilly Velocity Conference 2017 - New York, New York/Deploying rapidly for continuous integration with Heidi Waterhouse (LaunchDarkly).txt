hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,980
velocity in New York City I'm here with

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,359
Heidi from lunch starkly Heidi how you

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,820
doing I'm doing great

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,219
so once darkly very intriguing name can

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,469
you unpack that a little bit for us so

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,480
launch darkly refers to the way we let

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,340
people deploy things without actually

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,160
having to turn them on we're separating

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,900
deployment with activation and that

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,050
gives people a chance to build things

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,119
sort of on the quiet side and then make

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,880
a big showy entrance and so how do you

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,329
do all that I mean how do you guys let

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,680
people deploy and manage things

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,960
throughout it it's a really

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,450
collaborative effort it's not that we're

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,890
controlling anybody's features it's that

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,690
we are giving them the control over

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,789
their features so they wrap their code

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,660
at the application level in a little

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,250
code snippet and then we keep track of

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,530
all of the code snippets and present it

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,680
to them in a single pane of control so

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,480
you can turn things on and off and even

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,730
turn them on and off at like various

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,960
levels so you can say I only want to

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,409
push 10% of the feature you know I want

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,090
to push this to 10% of the people and

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,830
then we can increase the number of

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,540
people who see the feature so you guys

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,360
have flags and things like that that you

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,610
you offer all the people who use launch

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,009
darkly and then people can write their

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,330
own flags too or we mostly ask people to

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,520
write their own flags because they know

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,140
their business case best okay so we're

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,119
not trying to say this is the one way to

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,680
do it we're just saying if when you

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,350
write a flag we're gonna help you manage

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,390
it and see how it's working and what's

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,759
the most surprising way someone's used

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,250
one of these flags we found out that

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,990
somebody was using flags for when a user

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,570
went through a certain series of actions

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,460
it would trigger an email to them so to

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,420
the user to the users so imagine like

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,299
you go through a whole like a search on

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,700
a site and you collect all the the

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,049
pictures that that are on this then it

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,820
would trigger an email to see it -

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,750
you're saying like you've won this

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,780
scavenger hunt

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,340
Oh interesting yeah okay so you they can

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,719
use it positively but they could also

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,850
probably use it for like customer

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,940
support right like if you kept going to

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,340
a dead end and right like with

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,700
we like to say that you can you can

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,320
always like change the way the the

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,420
program behaves for your users

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,730
so in a way that kind of mitigates risk

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,650
for some people so can you talk a little

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,470
bit about how your feature management

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,290
helps reduce risk because we are

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,180
separating deployment and activation

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,710
we're giving people the chance to do

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,600
testing like you could do internal

00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,840
testing with a deployed product in

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,340
production so it's like like real but

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,170
only people inside your company are

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,830
saying it or only beta testers are

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,570
saying it so it gives people a chance to

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,150
test things in production without

00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,100
exposing everybody to the risk so

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,110
testing things in production in today's

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,630
world it seems like everyone is moving

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,520
towards continuous delivery and

00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,500
continuous deployment continuous

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,060
integration how do you guys work that

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,800
into that model we're an essential part

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,200
of it we think because it gives people

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,940
the chance to be building things in

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,310
their mainline and then turn them on

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,320
only when they're ready so as opposed to

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,200
trying to merge or branch in which may

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,180
be sort of antique we're saying develop

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,930
in the mainline launch in the mainline

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,880
test in the mainline do everything in in

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,170
production and if something messes up

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,050
you have a kill switch

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,920
oops yeah kill switch we have we have a

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,390
big red button that we only distribute

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,540
the red button to very special customers

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,330
but what it actually is is we can toggle

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,360
the kill switch off faster than you can

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,100
say kill that feature because we're

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,100
doing it from very close to the user

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,650
point of view so the minute they say I

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,630
don't want to see this anymore and push

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,030
the button it stops being available to

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,060
all their users so that kill switch just

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,400
in a way rolls back to the last operable

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,170
we think of it more as rolling forward

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,450
because you're not undoing any other

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,400
changes you're only pulling that one

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,690
feature out all the other changes that

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,850
you've made continue forward

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,680
oh so it's kill for feature only yeah

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,120
which is awesome yeah so you're not

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,350
killing your whole you're not killing

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,600
your whole platform you're not rolling

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,120
back you're not degrading anything but

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,669
that one broken feature so since you're

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,630
rolling forward how fast does this kill

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,190
switch actually

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,920
work then it's like instantaneous

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,380
incident like fast no 200 milliseconds

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,830
they say okay wow so that's that's

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,750
pretty nice so what is the with all the

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,640
partners you work with okay what is the

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,710
number one thing that they want to do

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,260
what why why are they gravitating

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,170
towards you guys because they need to be

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,350
able to test in deployment and deploy

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,940
rapidly like we are so essential to how

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,510
you do continuous integration and

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,580
deployment so they really want that that

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,750
instant reaction we're also getting a

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,990
lot of people who have been rolling

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,850
their own and you know that works fine

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,010
up until you get about 50 feature flags

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,080
and then it gets unmanageable you can't

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,330
tell what's turned on and off and you

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,790
have to go look in the code for it we're

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,460
giving you a beautiful dashboard that

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,760
lets you see what is on and off for who

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,830
and do do I need to flag the different

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,360
features to and to enable the kill

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,790
switch to work on each of the different

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,530
features sir yeah each some magic that

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,450
you have to do or each feature has a

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,160
flag and you can control it in a number

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,510
of different ways so it's not like you

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,250
have to write a kill switch flag for

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,800
every feature you just have a flag for

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,480
every feature and you could kill it or

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,720
you can deploy it or you can deploy it

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,730
selectively it just gives you a range of

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,050
options for managing that feature next

00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,250
one how do we look forward to that

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,250
conversation thank you

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,430
