Title: Blockchains and cryptocurrencies: New paradigms for shared data - Neha Narula
Publication date: 2017-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Bitcoin showed us a new way of moving value around the internet without intermediaries. Neha Narula explains how this paradigm might apply to our traditional ways of thinking about databases that cross organizational boundaries. As data on the web becomes consolidated around a few key players, the blockchain might help users gain more control.

	00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:07,140
so bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,150
it came out in 2008 the software was

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,749
released in 2009 by this mysterious

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,220
figure named Satoshi Nakamoto and we

00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:18,840
have no idea who he she or they are

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,310
still mysterious this person dropped

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,980
bitcoin on the internet and then

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,890
disappeared and what it is is it's a way

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,610
of making digital payments without a

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,470
bank or a government or any other

00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,559
institution in the middle there is no

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,679
one who controls Bitcoin there is no CEO

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,800
there is no company that mostly manages

00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,859
it it's completely open its open-source

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,159
software but it's also an open network

00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:50,249
and that means that anyone anyone can

00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,339
join and become a part of it so you

00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:56,249
spend by transferring Bitcoin to someone

00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:59,309
and you get paid when someone transfers

00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:01,589
Bitcoin to you and behind all of this is

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,619
this data structure called the Bitcoin

00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:06,420
blockchain it's just a list of all of

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,409
the transactions that have happened in

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,500
the system and this data structure is

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,390
being maintained by thousands of

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,640
networked computers around the world and

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,270
that's what I found so exciting about it

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,570
it's actually the world's largest

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,640
consensus protocol so the blockchain is

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,130
the data center as the data structure

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,750
behind Bitcoin you have probably heard a

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,240
lot about it and let's just get this out

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,670
of the way there is a tremendous amount

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,700
of hype in this space there are probably

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,619
a lot of dogbert like people who might

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,630
be trying to convince you to buy this

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,289
technology and to buy whatever product

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,859
that they're selling

00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:47,549
so what's the deal is this space totally

00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,609
overhyped

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,850
or is it the best thing since the

00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:57,299
Internet well I think it can it can be a

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,420
little bit of both so first let's get

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,579
some terms out of the way okay so when

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,439
you hear the term private blockchain

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,359
what people are actually talking about

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,179
is a database with cryptographic

00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,640
signatures okay when you hear the term

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,050
permissioned blockchain what people are

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,230
talking about

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,660
a database with cryptographic signatures

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,330
that's run by many organizations at the

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,180
same time so I think the first one is

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,130
incredibly boring we all know how to

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,590
make databases pretty well they run

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,800
pretty efficiently they can serve

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,180
millions of queries per second databases

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,710
are doing just fine and adding

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,020
cryptographic signatures doesn't really

00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,300
seem like it changes much the second

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,130
thing is a little bit more interesting

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,290
because even though we've known

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,390
technically how to do this for a very

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,950
long time I haven't really seen it in

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,140
practice we don't really see multiple

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:56,090
organizations coming together to work on

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,090
the same core data

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,520
