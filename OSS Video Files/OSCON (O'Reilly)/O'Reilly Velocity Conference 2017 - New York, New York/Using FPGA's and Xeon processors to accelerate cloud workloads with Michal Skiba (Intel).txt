	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,270
hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,040
velocity New York I'm here with me how

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,910
are you doing hey I'm doing well thank

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,370
you you would Intel I am and Intel at

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,799
velocity what is the story here I was on

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,350
the Kirk sure yeah yeah so the

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,100
connection is that we're introducing a

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,680
new solution that combines FPGAs and

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,510
xeon processors young processors are are

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,230
well known well established in clouds

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,699
and data centers and we think that this

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,560
fpga technology can help accelerate a

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,210
lot of workloads a lot of applications

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,770
that are running in the cloud make that

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,809
acceleration all more power efficient

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,390
than it's been today so are these FPGAs

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,489
in a way kind of pluggable and like a

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,739
DevOps guys gonna bring in a whole array

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,410
of something to plug it in bring in a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,370
car right yeah yeah yeah yeah so there's

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,620
actually a couple of different form

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,260
factors were working on so there's one

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,140
form factor that has the processor and

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,969
the FPGA together and one package goes

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,399
into the same socket as the xeon

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,870
processor and then the other form factor

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,670
we're working on is exactly that kind of

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,439
pluggable form factor it's on the PCIe

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,560
card you can put in a couple of those

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,720
into your server and away you go and so

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,549
why would a DevOps want to do that

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,810
I mean what's what's the threshold that

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,509
they're gonna get to where they're gonna

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,299
say hey we need to start looking at new

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,340
technology like FPGAs to manage our

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,680
business yeah so you know what we've

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,780
noticed is that a lot of data centers

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,460
that are being put together today are

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,790
being put together for the next few

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,320
years

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,119
right you buy a piece of real estate you

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,590
put the building in there and you've got

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,909
a certain amount of capacity you hope

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,320
it's gonna work for you right for the

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,200
next five years seven years whatever

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,280
your lease contract is right now the

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,470
other thing we're noticing is that

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,140
there's ever more data it's coming into

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,759
the data center from IOT sensors or just

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,579
kind of out there from from the internet

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,619
right so we're seeing gigabytes and

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,259
terabytes and and so on more data coming

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,560
through and that is all putting a strain

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,610
on the servers that are in the cloud all

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,710
right you've got a process a lot more

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,869
you've got it to that quickly you've got

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,469
to do it in in real time and we think

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,509
that FPGAs could could serve well to try

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,700
and feel like out there so this is all

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,610
about expansion and growth for the

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,900
future you know to

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,360
figure out what our demands gonna be

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,140
mm-hmm are you guys building AI into

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,270
that as well so you can help in a way

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,220
self.size going forward or well we're

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,430
not quite there but what we are doing is

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,710
we're making AI frameworks and workloads

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,300
available for this platform that were

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,240
that we're putting together and bringing

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,010
it to market so it is possible to

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,290
accelerate certain inference algorithms

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,000
image recognition for example with FPGA

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,530
see that very quickly to that at scale

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,060
do that in power efficient manner so

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,090
that's that's where the focus is at the

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,060
moment okay and so FPGA is if we were to

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,680
look back at their history yeah how long

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,020
have they been around because it seems

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,420
like a new term yeah so it's definitely

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,950
a new term for the data center I think

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,450
there's only been a few customers who

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,930
have really used this in earnest that's

00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,060
scale

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,340
FP JS themselves have been around since

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,640
just about the 1980s right so just over

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,320
30 years initially I kind of like AI

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,380
yeah they were initially used to

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,790
prototype new chips new new a6 right

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,650
then they started being integrated into

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,080
different kinds of specialized equipment

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,090
medical equipment radar installations

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,440
right wherever you had a lot of data

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,500
that you needed to process very quickly

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,700
in a very power efficient manner and we

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,049
think there's an opportunity in the data

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,330
center we certainly have some customers

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,010
that recognize that too and so we want

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,190
to bring that bring that to the masses

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,750
we want to have a robust framework we

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,410
want to have a ecosystem of partners

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,970
that makes FP J's a lot more easily

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,580
consumable from virtual machines from

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,580
containers if you were to speak with a

00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,799
cio right now and say what is the

00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,580
biggest benefit that he can he or she

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,290
can get from moving to FPGAs what is it

00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,519
they're gonna get yeah so I think

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,280
they're gonna get a couple things the

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,200
first is that they're going to get

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,850
better TCO potentially right the way

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,090
that that calculation comes about is

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,519
that they'll be able to get more utility

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,930
out of the server that they've invested

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,190
in so they'll pay a little bit more to

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,690
get that FPGA in there but they're gonna

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,500
get maybe an order of magnitude more

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,670
performance right so for the same

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,200
electrical bill for the same cooling

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,430
capacity for the same real estate that

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,350
they've already priced then they're able

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,270
to get much more performance so their

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,030
cost of serving an individual user Falls

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,150
now there's another potential benefit

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,639
which is that they

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,139
have a better SLA better service level

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,400
agreement because they'll have lower

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,259
latency they'll have better

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,320
predictability on the response times

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,520
that's important for it for folks so I

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
would say that those are really though

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,479
the key ones and there's no complexity

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,729
added because of them will there be

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,919
complete like yep let's say just a

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,500
server goes down yeah heaven forbid you

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,210
know in December a server goes yeah is

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,750
it gonna be more difficult to untangle

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,759
that with an FPGA in the mix yeah so

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,199
we're trying to invest in a robust

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,030
framework that makes it as easy as

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,220
possible to use those FPGA is right and

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,199
we're trying to integrate into a

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,580
standard orchestration frameworks for

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,680
virtual machines and containers that

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,570
understand how to do failover in the

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,910
case of a catastrophic event like that

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,310
right so we're trying to trying to plug

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,960
into those paradigms and make the FPGA

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,699
an equal class citizens that we can do

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
that have that line-of-sight that we

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,570
have right now with disks and with

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,280
processors and and with with memory

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,320
right and be able to do some of the

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,090
vision on this we need to okay me how if

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,460
you and I sat down about months from now

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,090
and we sit in this room engineer and

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,039
have this conversation and I ask you

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,440
what has changed over the last year yeah

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,330
what do you hope to say from an Intel

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,970
perspective that has changed well I hope

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,419
people are gonna see more manifestations

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,130
of FPGAs and FPGA algorithms in the data

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,240
center we're just starting off but we

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,310
think that there's a lot of potential

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,020
for different different workloads we're

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,000
really bullish and optimistic about the

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,099
partners that we're working with and we

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,599
think that they're gonna help us really

00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,240
complete the solution there's a lot of

00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:00,180
value out that they're providing to make

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,150
the FPGA a lot more palatable right for

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,150
foreign customers who typically operate

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,400
just in the software layers and software

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,810
programming languages so we want to we

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,490
want to really complete the picture we

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,990
want to complete the stack right we want

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,669
to have a much broader ecosystem of

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,320
partners and and we're well underway

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:19,940
excellently how we look forward to

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,940
overseas you thank you thanks so much

00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,069
