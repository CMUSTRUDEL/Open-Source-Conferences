hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,130
velocity in New York City I'm here with

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,160
Chris from ns1 Chris how you doing great

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,440
how are you I'm doing well so we we

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,150
spoke last year can you give us an

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,670
update on what's happened with you guys

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,470
I would imagine quite a bit a lot has

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,600
happened in the last year I mean in

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,490
particular with ns1 but also I'd say

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,439
with our ecosystem in general right the

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,609
way DNS impacts applications and how

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,650
they're delivered on the Internet

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,090
I think has been really recognized over

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,489
the course of last year it's been

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,739
front-page news in a lot of ways in

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,190
particular we've seen two big things

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,590
happen in our ecosystem one is DDoS

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,149
attack right so malicious activity it's

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,219
really brought to the forefront the

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,719
impact that DNS has on how applications

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,520
are delivered to the Internet and what

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,530
happens when DNS isn't working right

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,180
that's change the way people think about

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,640
the technology where it fits into their

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,960
priority that kind of thing the other

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,640
thing that's happened is just a in the

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,039
set of players in the space we've had a

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,920
lot of M&A activity in our ecosystem

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,939
over the last year I'd say four of the

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,729
top market providers or suppliers in the

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,619
DNS ecosystem have been bought in that

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,540
time frame and so that really changes

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,000
the way people think about the strategic

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,090
value so what types of companies want to

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,650
buy a company like a DNS copy yeah it's

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,330
a great question so three of those

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,610
bodies are private equity buys so that

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,619
tells you a lot of things private equity

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,820
steps in in the later stages of the

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,310
business when they think they can

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,079
achieve some kind of margin improvement

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,439
something like that I think the most

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,299
interesting one though for us has been

00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,299
Oracle stepping in to buy dine right and

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,310
this is about Oracle going after the

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,990
public cloud ecosystem recognizing that

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,180
they need a full suite of services to do

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,549
it and that DNS is a critical piece of

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,899
that puzzle because DNS is the entry

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,970
point every single application on the

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,430
internet right so any public cloud

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,799
provider needs some sort of answer for

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,619
DNS and traffic management Oracle's

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,740
answer was to go by deine who you know

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,200
we compete with in the space and you

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,390
know others Amazon and Microsoft and

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,410
Google have begin to tiptoe into the

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,320
ecosystem by building

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,120
early offerings I'd say but you know

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,250
that particular purchase was a really

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,440
interesting one so DNS has been around

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,060
forever I mean it's been around for a

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,940
long very long time about thirty five

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,760
years this year exactly what's new and

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,530
different yeah so it's a great question

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
and you know I'll answer this by talking

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,310
about sort of the evolution of the

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,130
ecosystem a little bit right so DNS been

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,840
around since roughly 1983 or so but the

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,420
first 20 years of DNS were not

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,190
commercial at all DNS was open source

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,780
software that you downloaded you put in

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,140
your data center if you were Yahoo in

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,720
1996 you had sis admin's whose job it

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,240
was to run your DNS server right there

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,790
wasn't a lot of evolution in the

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,550
operational aspects of DNS systems or

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,380
the protocol itself in that timeframe

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,500
the emergence of a commercial ecosystem

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,860
in the early 2000s the motivation was

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,240
mostly about perhaps someone who knows a

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,470
lot about the DNS protocol and

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,050
networking is going to do a better job

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,600
of keeping my domain online than I

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,340
myself am going to do so we saw a lot of

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,010
focus on kind of the networking elements

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,709
in the next call it 10 years after that

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,300
where differentiation was mostly about

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,060
how reliable is the network servicing

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,610
this protocol how fast is it what's the

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,410
price right I think the next evolution

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,209
that we've started to see and like where

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,489
a lot of the acceleration is coming from

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,489
right now is the recognition we've never

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,380
made good use of DNS lookup as an

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,060
opportunity to inject some kind of

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,220
intelligence and make some smart

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,410
decision when you type something calm in

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,150
your browser that's a great time for us

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,650
to decide where should we direct this

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,660
easier to receive the best quality of

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,580
service and that's that's why we're in

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,010
the space that's why we stepped in is to

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,600
bring some intelligence atop all of what

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,340
we see is those table stakes network

00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,769
elements and so bringing intelligence

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,470
and are you actually moving on that AI

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,660
front now as well yeah I mean that's a

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,420
that's a great question and I would say

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,600
step one right is bringing the data

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,310
right all intelligence acts on data and

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,170
a lot of our job is to take in data

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,790
about what's going on in our customers

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,410
infrastructure right now like how load

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,380
it is this load balancer in this data

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,710
center or how much compute capacity do I

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,509
have over here and also information

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,060
what's going on on the internet between

00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:29,460
end users and the code that services

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,990
them and once we get all that data and

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,850
we can enable making smart decisions

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,699
there are a lot of different ways that

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,039
we do that from our rule sets that are

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,070
very application specific to automation

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:43,080
that begins to look a lot like AI that

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,580
examines this data and an aggregate says

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,729
what's the best option for this user

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,949
right now so much like a a traffic just

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:52,860
DNS is similar to like a traffic thing

00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:55,710
in fact the analogy that we often will

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,009
use is you probably would not go by a

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,570
DNS or sorry a GPS I'm like you would

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,160
have bought 10 years ago that just has

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,960
the map right these days you want the

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,669
GPS that also knows what's the traffic

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,410
like right now and is that store open

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,229
and that's what we are for for the

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,590
domains we service ok so in the future

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:15,599
with AI embedded with that or included

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,419
with that you could start to predict

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,130
performance issues coming on the

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,080
forefront and where you need to route

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,449
traffic is that absolutely anything

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,460
that's a direction that we're headed in

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,620
and I think the other the other in a

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,110
broader direction that we particularly

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,030
are headed in right is automation with

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,150
respect to these systems and you know

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,490
big theme in this conference right is

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,990
automation of infrastructure operational

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,150
efficiency of the infrastructure through

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,530
automation and DNS is one of those

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,150
pieces of the puzzle that's always just

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,770
been thought of as kind of over there it

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,530
works right we don't need to think about

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,789
it but as our infrastructure that

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,310
services our applications is becoming

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,710
more dynamic more elastic more

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,240
distributed around the world to address

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,820
kind of a wider audience or a

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,070
proliferation of devices or IOT things

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,979
like that really becomes important that

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,630
our network elements including DNS tie

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,139
in to that automation in a graceful way

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:13,110
how do we make sure that the DNS doesn't

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,870
get co-opted by one large company or how

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,490
do we make sure that you know it's still

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,190
gonna run the internet and do the right

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,240
well you know I think there are some

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,919
organizational designs or structures

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,460
right that are that are in place to

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,539
ensure this so I can the governing body

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,430
the internet right is really

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:32,190
fundamentally responsible for DNS at the

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,229
end of the day DNS itself is a very

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,280
widely distributed system run by many

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,050
different organization

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,150
is all the way up to the roots of the

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,100
DNS infrastructure I don't think we're

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,840
to at risk of that I do think we're

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,470
beginning to see more concentration on

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,900
the commercial side as used by

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,600
enterprises or Internet companies right

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,300
the set of DNS vendors that are really

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,430
pushing the protocol ahead or enabling

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,680
new technology with respect to DNS has

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,150
narrowed especially with some of the M&A

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,410
that's happened over the last year right

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,240
and I think that's a fair concern

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,850
although I think like any ecosystem

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,860
right innovation sort of saves the day

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,310
and new companies step in and do new

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,470
things and emerge is kind of major

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,540
players in the ecosystem so if you if

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,950
you sat down next year that's the same

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,380
time with me and we had this

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,880
conversation what would you think is

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,740
going to change in the market over the

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,700
next 12 months yeah I think there's a

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,870
lot of things that are going to change

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,340
the market over the next 12 months

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,760
there's things that are not going to go

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,890
away such as the recognition of the DDoS

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,690
risk or the security risk with respect

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,100
to DNS right one of the things that's

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,169
accelerated this year and I think will

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,950
continue to accelerate into next year is

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:43,080
the recognition that as an application

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,940
owner you really need redundancy at this

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,220
layer of your stack you need multiple

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,330
DNS networks servicing your domains so

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,770
that if one of them comes under attack

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,810
or has some kind of an outage you've got

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,130
a backup that is active and able to take

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,750
on that workload and this isn't going

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,000
away even across all kinds of other

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,830
cloud services right that's one big

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,950
trend the other big trend I think that

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:08,100
we're beginning to see a lot is around

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,720
how DNS strategy fits into the internal

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,520
architecture of an application or the

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,280
internal systems of an application we're

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,560
being asked very frequently how we fit

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,620
into micro service deployments or

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,510
container scheduled deployments and this

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,700
is pretty natural right like what we

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,190
focus on is automation of the DNS and

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,110
that has implication certainly for all

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,550
the big internet facing stuff but also

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,260
down in the data center inside the

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,460
application as well excellent

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,810
Chris would look forward that commerce

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,810
thank you very much thanks for having me

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,760
