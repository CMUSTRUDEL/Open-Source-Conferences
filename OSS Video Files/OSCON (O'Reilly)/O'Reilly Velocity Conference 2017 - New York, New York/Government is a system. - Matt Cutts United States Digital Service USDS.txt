Publication date: 2017-10-03
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	In government, you can still find out-of-date tech practices like writing requirements for years or launching systems without monitoring. The government wants more effective technology. Meanwhile, everyone else wants a more effective government. Matt Cutts discusses how better technology can improve not just software systems but also trust in government itself.

I'm the new administrator of the u.s.

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,620
digital service which is a you might

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,999
know us from the group of geeks that

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,900
helped rescue the healthcare.gov website

00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:14,339
and our goal is pretty simple we try to

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,740
make sure that the federal government

00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,830
delivers the best possible services to

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,040
the public that we can we actually

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,780
celebrated our third birthday recently

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,180
we're still around we're still working

00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,539
on projects that matter and we're hiring

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,180
I wanted to talk to you today about one

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,650
project that's going really well and it

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,310
has a lot of impact it's about trying to

00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,260
make the Medicare system more efficient

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,410
now if you would come to me a year ago I

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,260
would have been like Oh Medicare really

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:53,850
what is that it turns out Medicare

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,470
affects 55 million Americans it pays out

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,020
over six hundred and fifty billion

00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,219
dollars a year which is three point five

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,480
percent of the u.s. economy and most of

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,760
the health care industry looks at what

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,420
Medicare does and often mimics it so add

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,799
another 2.5 trillion dollars on you're

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,020
talking 18% of the u.s. economy now

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,430
that's just a bunch of numbers so let me

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,940
give you one more reason why we need

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:26,549
Medicare to work well this is my dad I

00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,159
got permission to put his picture up he

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:35,070
just celebrated his 75th birthday last

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:37,950
month but he almost didn't he exercises

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:42,659
every day but over the July 4th weekend

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:46,650
he had a serious health issue this is my

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,290
dad's heart it turns out he had an 80 to

00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:53,159
90 percent blockage in his left main

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,970
artery which I discovered is also called

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,860
the Widowmaker now he's okay he had

00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,939
heart bypass surgery he's looking

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,150
forward to getting back to playing

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,369
tennis again this week he had really

00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,860
good coverage at his local hospital in

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,300
Kentucky care that was effective and

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,860
efficient but not excessive so getting

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,690
Medicare right real

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,460
matters I hope none of us have to deal

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,080
with the health care system but probably

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:24,360
all of us will if we're lucky so the

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,090
goal is to figure out how we can make

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,760
Medicare better unfortunately right now

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,980
Medicare doesn't really pay for

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,530
encouraging better results the more

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,500
tests you run the more you get paid and

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,560
the more expensive technology you use

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,020
the more you get paid even if that

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,980
doesn't really encourage better outcomes

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,160
for patients so Congress saw this and in

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,680
2015 they passed a bipartisan law the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,190
idea was simply to pay for patient care

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,360
not just for quantity so they told CMS

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,930
which is the agency that administers

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,130
Medicare to do two things one collect

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,239
data on what doctors were doing and two

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,010
adjusts the payments based on the

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,750
quality of the care now what's an

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,880
example of that very simple one if you

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,280
get treated in a hospital do you get

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,760
readmitted to the hospital within 30

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,030
days by the way Congress said to start

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,310
doing this within two years now if you

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,989
have ever built a large system that

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,280
affects things at a national level you

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,280
know that's not that much time

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,470
