Description: 
	To grow your technical leadership skills, it's critical to lean on your network of support. Mentors—people who can give you helpful advice—are usually easy enough to find. Lara Hogan explains that what can be even more valuable is finding sponsors—people who can help you find new opportunities and improve the visibility of your work.

economist and professor armenia ybarra

00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:07,729
says in mentorship the connection to

00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,890
actually getting promoted and actually

00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:12,680
getting developmental assignments gets

00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,510
kind of diluted sponsoring has to do

00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,430
with fighting for someone to get some to

00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,660
get a promotion and mentioning their

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,950
name and an appointments meeting and

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,440
making sure that the person you're

00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,970
sponsoring gets that next assignment and

00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,520
gets visible and developmental

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,070
assignments

00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,050
so while mentorship is really handy when

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,670
it comes to thinking through problems or

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,979
getting advice on how someone else has

00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,199
tackled an issue before sponsorship is

00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:40,069
more directly correlated to career

00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:42,409
trajectory as Kate Houston says mentors

00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:45,409
give perspective sponsors give

00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:47,600
opportunity this is because to sponsor

00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,089
someone is to feel on the hook to help

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,499
get someone promoted it is raising up

00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,120
their name of someone to help them get

00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:56,179
more opportunities to do visible

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,309
valuable work it can also include giving

00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:01,909
advice and mentorship but that's not why

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,889
it's the most effective we don't all

00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:06,200
have the networker opportunity that Jon

00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:07,910
or Courtney have as kate says in her

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,520
excellent blog post on the subject

00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,040
sponsorship can be super small too

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,230
giving someone a book giving them access

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,350
to your network making an intro for them

00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,940
getting them a job it is really likely

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,920
that you've had a sponsor already in

00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,780
your career and you've probably been a

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,960
sponsor to someone too even if you

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,850
didn't realize it anytime you suggest

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,260
that someone work on a cool project or

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,450
mention their name as someone who's

00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,280
doing really good work on a topic or

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,180
tell someone's boss that they're doing a

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,980
really great job

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,080
that's sponsorship and he is incredibly

00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,890
effective to weigh more than mentorship

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,840
the Center for talent innovation

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,780
measured the career benefits of

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,040
sponsorship for men and for women

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,159
apologies the study didn't include data

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,980
about non-binary people this study found

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,159
that without a sponsor behind them 43%

00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,470
of men and 36% of women will ask their

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,229
manager for a stretch of címon however

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:08,209
with sponsor support the numbers rise

00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:10,129
respectively to 56% and 44% this is huge

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,080
imagine how many more opportunities

00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:16,100
these folks will have just by asking

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,930
for more challenging and impactful work

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,210
having a sponsor has tangible monetary

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,010
impacts as well the majority of

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,530
unspotted men and women resist

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,880
confronting their boss about a raise but

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,520
with a sponsor in their corner

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,840
nearly half of men and 38% of women

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,040
summoned that courage to negotiate again

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,350
imagine the impact on your life that

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,000
just the act of having a sponsor can

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,830
have in your own confidence in

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,230
negotiating for more compensation this

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,210
study found in total that a sponsor

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,810
confers a statistical career benefit of

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,850
anything from 22 to 30 percent depending

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,310
upon what's requested an assignment or a

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,640
pay raise and who's asking men or women

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,110
this is enormous I'm surprised that more

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,880
people out in the world aren't yet

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,400
talking about finding sponsors for

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,380
themselves as humans we naturally think

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,880
through who can give us that helpful

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,800
advice that we're looking for

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,110
it's time for us to start thinking about

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,500
who can give us those opportunities that

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,500
