hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,980
velocity in York I'm here with Casey

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,210
West from Google Casey how you doing I'm

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,400
doing great it's a great day

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,500
so how has the event been for you so far

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,660
so far so good you know I spent a lot of

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,219
time on the show floor just talking to

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,379
people here at the event about what

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,750
they're trying to do what they're trying

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,640
to get out of it the events there the

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,230
talks they went to is pretty good is

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,590
anyone asking you what's driving Google

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,330
to go all in on the cloud or yeah I hear

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,250
a lot about that I hear a lot about you

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,289
know why why should we go with Google

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,870
cloud versus other competitors and the

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,460
answer is really there's a really great

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,280
suite of technologies you can choose

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,190
from many providers but we've been

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,260
building cloud native large-scale

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,760
software for a long time and trying to

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,140
make our platforms available to others

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,350
so that they can do the same thing and

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,170
what are the driving forces at Google

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,930
pushing you guys to offer cloud platform

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,579
cloud services cloud tools what's what's

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,609
driving all that yeah that's a great

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,969
question so I really feel like we have a

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,199
particular view on open cloud and api's

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,729
if you look at some of the open source

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,880
work we're involved in with kubernetes

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,869
and tensorflow we're trying to build

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,119
large-scale commodity tools that

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,680
everyone can take advantage of and then

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,689
we also happen to have a lot of

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,759
experience running those things so if

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,860
people want resiliency and reliability

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,390
we think we can offer them that the same

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,920
way we try to for our own engineers

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,979
internally so you have the Devon you

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,740
have the ops really we do we do and of

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,290
course we use sre as our model so your

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,640
liability engineering for how we try and

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,189
build a contract between those two

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,530
groups and what in your in the cloud

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,960
group that's right what are your users

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,970
adopting the most what's the the hottest

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,810
thing right now is it the kubernetes or

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,920
is it tensorflow or is it yeah that's a

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,240
good question I think it depends on the

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,890
audience there are a lot of people who

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,229
are just trying to manage their

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,640
operational scale so they're looking at

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,340
things like containers which are now a

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,719
large scale commodity and running those

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,799
things at scale can be quite challenging

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,920
so tools like Google container engine or

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,680
the gke we call it those are getting a

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,660
lot of popularity but I do see a great

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,250
uptick in machine learning and the

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,830
interest in taking advantage of that so

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,020
we have a suite of tools every

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,900
from the the components that you need to

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,100
put together yourself in order to do

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,220
large-scale machine learning on your own

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,710
to pre train models which a lot of folks

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,050
are taking advantage of very easy to do

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,090
with basic restful api so you guys work

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,150
with a lot of companies and have you

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,160
noticed any barriers for companies that

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,930
are trying to go in on the cloud and

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,320
have some cloud adoption that their

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,990
organization we have yeah so it's often

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,330
not a technological barrier and there

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,920
there's always an organization there's

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,840
always a group inside of an organization

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,460
that has a lot of experience or has a

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,800
lot of good ideas and insight about how

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,240
to move into the cloud successfully but

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,650
oftentimes its organizational and

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,050
cultural there are a lot of barriers

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,940
when you have inertia moving you in one

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,230
direction trying to make a big shift

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,930
into the cloud and really be successful

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,000
can be daunting it can be a little scary

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,890
sometimes so often times it's more about

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,900
people than it is technology so then

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,580
what's would take another angle at that

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,800
same question are there any best

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,050
practices that you see that allow

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,160
companies to move to a cloud strategy

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,560
much better there are you know DevOps is

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,420
almost ten years old now as a concept

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,600
and this concept is really about

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,800
collaboration and how we work together

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,080
having respect for one another trying to

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,959
share a common bigger picture goal and

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,700
the big best practice that I've seen be

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,200
successful is when you can really align

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,090
each of the groups in an organization

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,560
that are trying to be successful that

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,900
need each other in order to be

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,540
successful as successful and that takes

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,370
leadership to recognize the bigger

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,230
picture problems that everyone faces

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,780
it's not just an Operations problem and

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,250
management of technology it's not just a

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,790
building problem and software

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,930
engineering really we have a complete

00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,459
set of concerns when it comes to

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,160
building and delivering software so if

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,350
we can just get on the same page and try

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,480
to align ourselves that's the biggest

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,459
factor that I've seen is that was the

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,200
promise of DevOps from day one right

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,910
meeting the two tribes together it

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,890
really was and sometimes we get focused

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,940
on the specific tools techniques and

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,380
processes the the monitoring or Incident

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,140
Response and all of those things have to

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,240
be well managed but it's not the the

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,100
core of success from what I've seen so

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,170
at velocity this week and you know you

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,000
guys have been coming too

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,680
velocity for quite a while are you

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,610
focusing more on kubernetes and

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,160
stackdriver

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,020
velocity this year and why yeah we are

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,440
and there are a couple of reasons for

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,060
that

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,120
kubernetes has such widespread adoption

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,820
it's of course open source and we have

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,070
contributors for many many technology

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,900
companies not just Google Red Hat's

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,810
involved and a bunch of other big

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,150
players so really bringing out a team of

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,100
people who can talk to folks on at this

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,110
audience about kubernetes is pretty

00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,890
helpful stackdriver is also a multi

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,420
cloud it's a technology that does debug

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,820
everything from a lot of debugging in

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,220
the cloud do log analysis and monitoring

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,470
we're providing a suite of tools that

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,780
connects to many other technologies like

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,590
data dog or New Relic but also can work

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:18,140
on AWS or or Google Con so you guys have

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,690
a strategy with open source and you

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,700
Google has always been in different open

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,100
source communities what is the strategy

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,350
behind your multiple cloud offerings and

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,300
especially investing in open source

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,730
technologies for those cloud offerings

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,830
yeah we really believe in an open

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,420
ecosystem so we're trying to build an

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:40,070
open culture whether that's open source

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:42,170
or broad consumable api's things that

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,790
can really be reused so we try to bring

00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,920
that out into the world and if that

00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,320
means that we have an opportunity to

00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,820
build tools that work across clouds or

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,390
cross providers we're gonna we're gonna

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,600
go for it

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,400
excellent so I'm also seen a trend in

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,140
this world right now with most

00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,950
technology companies most businesses of

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,440
any kind

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,210
that there's either a transformation

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,950
happening and they're what I would call

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,500
the Transformers they're trying to get

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,820
someplace so they're not disrupted and

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,470
they're not losing their market share

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,030
but then there's the other side the

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,610
disruptors who are trying to disrupt

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,750
those large companies and take over

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,150
market share from them

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,370
what's Google are you a disrupter you

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,950
transformer because I see you in both

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,650
camps in a way I see us in both camps

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,780
too I feel like that depends on the

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,330
perspective of the of the organizations

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,280
that we might be either in competition

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,530
or collaboration with and that's sort of

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,280
how I see it if you want to participate

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,660
in an open ecosystem with open api's and

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,070
standards then I think you're gonna have

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,780
a better time transforming this industry

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,550
with Google and if you are less

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,490
interested in that then you might find

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,040
disruption coming to your door 7 okay

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,800
so if we were to look at that model of

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,470
what Google does today and everything

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,000
you guys offer in the cloud if we had

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,040
this conversation twelve months from now

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,320
in New York next year what would you

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,730
like to say changes for Google during

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,070
that 12 months and what would you like

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,610
to see changing in general for the

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:12,000
market hmm so for Google I of course

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,570
like to see more organizations moving

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
workloads to our cloud platform we think

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,820
that we've got something good to offer

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,680
in and and that's in conjunction with

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,280
potentially other clouds if you need a

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,480
hybrid solution for instance in terms of

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,910
the the industry and this audience the

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,340
people who come to velocity I'd like to

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,100
see folks be able to solve bigger

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,420
problems more efficiently so taking

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,130
advantage of technologies that are

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,470
provided whether it's Google or another

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,020
another company or another open-source

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,820
technology taking advantage of solutions

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,370
that can remove more and more of the

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,440
toil from our daily lives the the you

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,210
know redundant work that we often have

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,100
to do sometimes in technology it'd be

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,550
nice to continue to be able to remove

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,470
that we think that incorporating

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,930
technologies like machine learning into

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,700
things like Incident Response can get

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,770
you there and there are plenty of other

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,260
companies who are doing things along

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,060
similar lines so being able to increase

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,950
resiliency by being more efficient would

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,450
be nice excellent case we look forward

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,450
that conversation next year thank you

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,110
