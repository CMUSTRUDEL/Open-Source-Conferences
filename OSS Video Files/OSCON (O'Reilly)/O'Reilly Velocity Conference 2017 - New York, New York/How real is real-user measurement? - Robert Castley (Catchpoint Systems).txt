Publication date: 2017-10-04
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Some quarters of our market believe that real-user measurement (RUM) is the end-all and be-all of customer experience management. But with the advancement of ad blockers, RUM tags are often getting blocked. Robert Castley explores the relevancy of real-user data if real users are blocking RUM tags and shares some solutions.

good morning everybody my name is Robert

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,510
Kelly and I'd like to welcome you to my

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,740
little slot here and my little slot is

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,720
all about how real is real user and what

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,370
I mean by that is how real is the real

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,360
use of measurement data that you're

00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,449
collecting the reason I chose this topic

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:28,020
to talk about was that recently I was

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,770
trying to help out a customer with their

00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,500
real user monitoring solution and I just

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,880
couldn't see the tag firing and that it

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,079
turned out because I was working from

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,200
home I had been blocking all the adverts

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,690
all the malware sites all the tracking

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,489
tools all the tracking pixels and this

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,370
is why I couldn't see the tag firing and

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,899
this led me to think about this and do a

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,090
little bit of research and just try and

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,090
understand how many other people around

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,539
the world are also doing this on their

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,910
desktops and laptops and mobile devices

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:06,650
and we can see here that in 2016

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,500
there was 650 million devices that were

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,570
basically blocking adverts I mean in the

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,119
room can anybody would people put their

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,320
hand up if they block ads yeah so

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,590
looking around the room there's about I

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,840
would say that was about 50% so you if

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,840
anybody is like blocking ads and and

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,869
doing that you are potentially impacting

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
real user measurement data now there's

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,140
many ways that you can block ads for

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,299
those that the DIMM put their hand up

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,369
will teach you now how you can do it

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,500
um so you who I'm sorry for any advert

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,170
providers in the room and we're not

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,970
trying to do you have business here but

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,220
so you can install extensions in your

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,770
browser so all the popular browsers have

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,290
extensions that allow you to block ads

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,840
but it's not just about blocking ads

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,189
they can block all kinds of things you

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,049
know like the malware I talked about I

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,119
actually helped out a friend recently

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,860
third visited a site they probably

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,500
shouldn't have gone to and got malware

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,239
and you know sorted that all out and put

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,090
the ad blocker on and they can go back

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,309
to that site now and probably be safe um

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,920
there's also you can get them for all

00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:17,830
your mobile

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,290
vices and then my favorite one is an

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,930
open-source project called piehole net

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,780
and I have a little Raspberry Pi at home

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,450
and that was the root of my problem as

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,430
it was blocking absolutely everything it

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,650
blocks if you come to my house and get

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,730
my Wi-Fi you're not gonna see a single

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,130
advert you're not gonna get malware

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,780
you're not gonna get tracked because the

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,200
pie hole is just basically filtering

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,540
everything out and all these blocking

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,250
technologies use a lot of lists and

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,810
there's a hell of a lot of lists out

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,170
there you know you can get them on

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,420
filled lists github there's my favorite

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,810
one is easy list and you go through all

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,690
of these lists and it impacts a lot of

00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,370
real user monitoring companies when you

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,720
go through those lists you can see what

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,420
is being blocked and what's not being

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,410
blocked I didn't put the Trump blocker

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,620
on there because I couldn't find

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,989
anything that blocked Donald Trump but

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,950
if anybody knows that list can you can

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:18,220
you let me know please so how can you

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,650
get around this problem so if you are

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,600
obviously wanting to track real users

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,609
coming to your website there are a

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,859
couple of ways that I investigated that

00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:29,170
could potentially solve the problem the

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:31,570
easiest one is obviously to get in touch

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,400
with the list maintain errs and try and

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,920
get yourself whitelisted or get your run

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,100
provider whitelisted oftenly off off

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,810
those lists you obviously if you're

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,090
running an ad blocker you sometimes

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,680
visit sites for example like Forbes com

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,000
they know you're running an ad blocker

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,730
and they're not going to let you proceed

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
until you switch off your ad blocker but

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,239
there are ways to trick even those kinds

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,820
of tools that are encouraging you to

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,370
switch off your ad blocker but probably

00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,130
the best method is try and get you know

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,250
a cname to your run provider so make it

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,069
the rum tag appear as though it's coming

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,530
from your own domain rather than your

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,970
run providers domain because you know if

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,620
your site's getting blocked by these ad

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,130
blockers then you know you might as well

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,799
shut up business and go home but it's

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,780
it's it's like these are about the only

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,870
three ways I think we can get around it

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,539
and ad blocking and like I say it is

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,190
growing this is figures from 2016 you

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:28,330
know come the end of this year be

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,400
interesting to see

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,349
you know what the rise of ad blocking is

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,060
and I think when you sort like here all

00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:35,620
the scares about malware and everything

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,539
else people are looking to these tools

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,639
to try and protect their you know their

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,620
desktops because they just you know the

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,199
people that do this are getting cleverer

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,689
and cleverer and cleverer so with that I

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,789
was short and sweet that's what

00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,500
everybody calls me if anybody wants to

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,349
come and chat to me about that you can

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,909
find us in booth 405 in the sponsors

00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:56,289
pavilion and I'd like to thank you for

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:59,280
your time and enjoy the rest of the

00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:59,280
