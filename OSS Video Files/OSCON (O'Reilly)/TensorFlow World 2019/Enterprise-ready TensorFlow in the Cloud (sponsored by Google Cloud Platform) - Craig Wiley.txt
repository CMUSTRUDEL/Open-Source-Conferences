	00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,310
I just want to begin by saying I've been

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,100
dabbling in like cloud a I and cloud

00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:14,209
machine learning for a while and during

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,650
that time I it never occurred to me that

00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:17,510
we'd be able to come out with something

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,849
like we did today because this is only

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,939
possible because Google Cloud and

00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:25,869
tensorflow can collaborate unbelievably

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:28,189
closely together within within Google so

00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,199
to begin let's let's talk a little bit

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:33,170
about tensorflow

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,930
46 million downloads tensorflow has been

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,820
massive growth the last few years it's

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,980
expanded from from the forefront of

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,220
research which we've seen earlier this

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,530
morning to businesses taking it on as a

00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,220
dependency for their business to operate

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,530
on a day-in day-out basis it's a super

00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,630
exciting piece as someone who spends

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,850
most of their time most all of their

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,770
time thinking about how we can bring AI

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,350
and machine learning into businesses

00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:04,729
seeing tensor flows commitment and focus

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:08,420
on deploying actual ml in production is

00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:11,630
super exciting to me with this grouse

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,109
though comes growing pains and part of

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,850
that is things like support right when

00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:20,179
my model doesn't do what I expected it

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,539
to or or my training job fails you know

00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:25,609
what options do I have and you know how

00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:28,340
well does your boss respond when you say

00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:30,469
hey yes I've I don't know why my models

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,530
not training but not to worry I've put a

00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:37,280
question on slack and hopefully someone

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,409
will get back to me you know we

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,020
understand that businesses who are

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,939
taking a bet on tensorflow as a critical

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,369
piece of their hardware architecture or

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,369
their their stack need more than this

00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,580
second it can be a challenge to unlock

00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,960
the scale and performance of cloud for

00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,280
those of you who like me have gone

00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,990
through this journey over the last

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,660
couple of years you know for me it

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,940
started on my laptop right and then

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,610
eventually I outgrew my laptop and so I

00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,200
had a gaming rig under my desk right

00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,090
with a GPU and eventually there were

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,220
eight GP there were eight gaming rigs

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,960
under my desk and when you open the door

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,540
to my office the whole floor knew

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,260
because it sounded like Antoine right

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,480
and but now with today's cloud that

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,940
doesn't have to be the case you can go

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,819
from that single instance all the way up

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:33,530
to a massive scale you know seamlessly

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,530
so with that

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:42,269
today we bring you tensorflow enterprise

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,480
tensorflow enterprise is designed to do

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:51,940
three things one give you enterprise

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:55,420
grade support to cloud scale performance

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,460
and three managed services when and

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,330
where you want them at the abstraction

00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,330
level you want them

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,390
enterprise-grade support what does that

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,490
mean fundamentally what that means is

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,390
that as these businesses take a bet on

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,030
tensorflow

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,570
many of these business have businesses

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,580
have IT policies or or requirements that

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,350
the software have you know a certain

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,580
longevity before they're willing to

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:27,270
commit to it in production and so today

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:30,090
for certain versions of tensorflow when

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:33,900
used on Google cloud we will extend that

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,750
one year of Sur of support a full three

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,920
years that means that if you're building

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,780
models on 11.15 today you can know that

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,270
for the next three years you'll get bug

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,990
fixes and security patches when and

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,990
where you need them

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,500
simple and scalable

00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,150
scaling from an idea on a single node to

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,939
production at massive scale can be

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,829
daunting right you know saying to my to

00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,930
my boss hey I took a sample of the data

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,670
was something that previously seemed

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,829
totally reasonable but now we're asked

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:12,060
to train on the entire corpus of data

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:14,640
and that can take days weeks we can help

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,609
with all of that by deploying tensorflow

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,590
on Google Cloud a network that's been

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,560
running tensorflow successfully for

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,440
years and has been highly optimized for

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,660
this purpose so scalable across our

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,699
world-class architecture the products

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,100
are compatibility tested with the cloud

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,350
their performance optimized for the

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,250
cloud and for Google's world-class

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,990
infrastructure

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,220
what does this mean so if any of you

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,760
have ever had the opportunity to use

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:49,360
bigquery bigquery is Google clouds kind

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,700
of massively parallel cloud hosted data

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,620
warehouse and if by the way if you

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,320
haven't tried using bigquery highly

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,930
recommend going out and trying it it is

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,200
it returns results faster than than can

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,970
be imagined that speed in bigquery we

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,000
wanted to make sure we were taking full

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,130
advantage of that and so recent changes

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,340
and recent pieces included in tensor

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,620
flow Enterprise have increased the speed

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,710
of the connection between the data

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,860
warehouse and an tensor flow by three

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,630
times right now all of sudden those jobs

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,630
that were taking days take hours

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,730
Unity gaming a wonderful customer and

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,330
partner with us you can see the quote

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,700
here

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,710
unity leverages these aspects of

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,980
tensorflow enterprise in their business

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,100
their monetization products reach more

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,070
than three billion devices three billion

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,760
devices worldwide game developers rely

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,340
on a mix of scale and products to drive

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,730
installs and revenue and player

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,600
engagement and unity needs to be able to

00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:02,080
quickly test build scale deploy models

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120
all at massive scale

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,640
this allows them to serve up the best

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,360
results for their developers and their

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,360
advertisers

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,730
managed services as I said tensorflow

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,890
enterprise will be available on Google

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,070
cloud and will be available as part of

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,680
Google clouds AI platform will also be

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,870
available in in VMs if you'd prefer that

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,970
or in containers if you want to run them

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,150
on Google Cloud Cooper Nettie's engine

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,510
or using coop flow on Cooper Nettie's

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,510
engine

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,830
in submarine tender tensorflow

00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:44,229
Enterprise offers enterprise grade

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,939
support that continuation that full

00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,729
three years of support that IT

00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:51,340
departments are accustomed to cloud

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,360
scale performance so that you can run it

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,460
massive scale

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,969
works seamlessly with our managed

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,520
services and all of this is free in

00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:06,840
fully included for all Google cloud

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:10,129
users Google cloud becomes the best

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,129
place to run tensorflow

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:16,309
but there's one last piece which is for

00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,769
companies for whom AI is their business

00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:20,509
not companies for whom AI might help

00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:23,029
with this part of their business or that

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,099
or might help optimize this this

00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:27,110
campaign or this back-end system but for

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,969
for companies where AI is their business

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,879
right where they're training hundreds of

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:34,819
thousands of hours of training a year

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,789
petabytes of data right using

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,019
cutting-edge models to meet their unique

00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,069
requirements we are introducing

00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:42,019
tensorflow

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,629
Enterprise with white gloves support

00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:46,669
this is really for cutting-edge AI right

00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:49,459
engineering to engineering assistance

00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:51,830
when needed you know close collaboration

00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:55,029
across Google allows us to fix bugs

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,029
faster if needed

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,110
one of the great opportunities of

00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,820
working in cloud if you ask my kids

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,850
they'll tell you that the reason I

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,250
working in cloud AI and and in kind of

00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,110
machine learning is in an effort to keep

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,389
them ever from learning to drive their

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,130
eight and ten years old so I need people

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,560
to kind of hurry along this route if you

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,090
will but you know one of the partners

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,699
one of the customers and partners we

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,740
have is crews automotive and you can see

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,990
here they're a shining example of the

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,300
work we're doing on this on their quest

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,940
towards self-driving cars they've also

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,280
experienced hiccups and challenges and

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,950
scaling problems and we've been a

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,800
critical partner for them in helping

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,110
ensure that they can achieve the results

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,080
they need to to solve this kind of

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,260
generational defining problem of auto of

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,839
autonomous vehicles you can see not only

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,850
did we improve the accuracy of their

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,750
models but also reduce training times

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,240
from four days down to one day

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,129
this crate this allows them to iterate

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,129
at speeds previously unthinkable

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,550
so none of this as I said wouldn't would

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,290
have been possible without the close

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:14,019
collaboration between Google Cloud and

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:16,160
tensorflow you know I I look back on on

00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:19,610
Megan's recent announcement of tensor

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,290
board dev you know we will be looking at

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,839
bringing that that type of functionality

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,120
into an enterprise environment as well

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,949
in the coming months but we're really

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,459
really excited to get tensorflow

00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:33,350
Enterprise into your hands today to
