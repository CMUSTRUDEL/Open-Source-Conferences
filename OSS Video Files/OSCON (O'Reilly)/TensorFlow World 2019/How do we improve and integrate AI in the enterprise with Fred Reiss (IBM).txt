hi Roger here with Fred Ryce chief

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,770
architect at the Center for open source

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,820
data in AI technologies at IBM welcome

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,440
Thank You Roger

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,540
so tell us a little about what the

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,019
center is working on and how it came

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,389
about

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,640
so around 2015 we started what we called

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,740
then the spark Technology Center this

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,140
was to be an open source lab all around

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,990
Apache spark and we kind of worked at

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,519
the confluence of IBM's

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,900
products our customers and the open

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,359
source community and we had a lot of

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,640
conversations about Apache spark but

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,590
what we found was every time we started

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,690
a conversation about spark the

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,960
conversation ended up talking about the

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,700
end-to-end AI lifecycle and every time

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,649
we tried to work on a software problem

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,270
involving spark we ended up pulling in

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,120
other components because you need to

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,010
talk to an object store to get data you

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,379
need to talk to Jupiter notebooks to

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,289
analyze the data you need to work on

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,539
Kubb flow to be able to you know get

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,449
infrastructure from the cloud so we

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,640
turned gradually into a center that was

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,650
focused on a whole bunch of foundational

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,619
AI technologies that were open-source

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,810
that underpinned that entire lifecycle

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,760
from beginning to end we still work on

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,619
Apache spark but at the beginning of

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,290
last year we decided we would rename the

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,049
Center to more accurately reflect the

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,450
evolved mission so now we're the Center

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,509
for open source data and AI technologies

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,130
and we work on a collection of different

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,799
open source projects

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,590
part of our mission is to identify what

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,540
are the best debride projects to use as

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,579
tools in your open source life cycle

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,079
part of our mission is to develop on

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,110
those projects from our unique position

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,850
as IBM Rouge we can see problems that

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,560
may be members of the community might

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,909
not be able to see and we can be bring

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,759
in targeted solutions to those problems

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,460
and we also serve as a conduit for

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,040
communication so we can talk to

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,960
IBM's internal credit groups we can talk

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,110
to members of the community we can talk

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,700
to our clients and oftentimes when we

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,250
talk to one of those groups we can bring

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,320
in information from the other two that

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,000
they might have not been exposed to so

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,250
it's a really great position to be in -

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,640
and it's great to be helping the open

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,200
source community to move forward

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,760
so you've kind of covered some of the

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,430
responses and goals but how would you

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,900
look absolutely what you're trying to do

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,350
what we're trying to do is we are trying

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,680
to make AI in the enterprise on top of

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,230
open-source work better it's something

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,730
where today if you want to deploy AI in

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,950
the enterprise you kind of have to be an

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,620
AI company well most of the companies

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,690
out there are not AAA companies we want

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,400
to make AI more like like a telephone

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,990
right you can have a telephone and on

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,940
your desk you can use the telephone all

00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,920
the time and yet your company's not a

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,930
phone company it should be the same with

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,400
AI that's where we're trying to get to

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,010
we're trying to make these technologies

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,500
easier to use make them integrate with

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,780
enterprise systems that develop the best

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,900
practices for using them so that AI just

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,480
kind of slots into enterprises into

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,110
businesses in the future so how does

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,320
tensorflow fit into your system

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,260
tensorflow

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,870
is a key part of building AI solutions

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,320
today I personally started working on

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,760
tensorflow in early 2017 and since then

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,610
I've been gradually building up the

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,680
tensorflow group within my team and

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,230
we've been reaching out to other groups

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,600
within IBM that work with tensorflow

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,100
we ship tensorflow and about half a

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,730
dozen products now and we have

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,070
consultants working on building

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,840
tensorflow solutions we have researchers

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,480
working with tensorflow so there's a

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,630
broad community of tensorflow users and

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,340
developers within IBM and my group which

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,769
focuses on open source contributions

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,410
directly to tensorflow is like right in

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,019
the middle of that so given with your

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,640
great involvement with tensorflow

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,250
what do you see like in the future for

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,480
open source intensive flow I think what

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,239
you're going to see in the future with

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,430
tensorflow is move towards even greater

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,290
openness and in fact a lot of that has

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,440
happened is happening already with the

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,330
2.0 release with tensorflow 2.0 people

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,370
talk a lot publicly about the user

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,350
visible portions of that you know

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,459
there's there's eager execution there's

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,160
Kerris there's either gege execution but

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,650
behind the scenes writing the code

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,539
working on contributions to tensorflow

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,579
what's been happening most of the work

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,220
has gone into much

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,009
lera tea and now we're as tensorflow one

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,020
point X was one big monolithic system

00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,610
and packaged up in one big monolithic

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,090
package that was kind of take it or

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,759
leave it

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,590
tensorflow to and moving forward is much

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,659
more modular so you start with

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,639
tensorflow core soon you'll be able to

00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,740
start with tensorflow core without even

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,930
the Python bindings there splitting

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,360
those off and then you pick and choose

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,150
different other components to plug into

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,400
that to build the solution you need what

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,940
this means in terms of openness is that

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,560
we have a larger number of smaller more

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,810
cohesive communities that can move

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,090
faster on innovating they're part of the

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,099
ecosystem it also means that third

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,110
parties can more equally pluck easily

00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:07,509
plug into tensor flow that makes it more

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,729
of a foundation not only for building

00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,680
solutions if you're selling something to

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,409
a client but also for creating new

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,050
open-source projects that just talk to

00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:19,419
tensorflow so I think we're smooth

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,060
towards more of a modular ecosystem

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,490
which seems to be accelerating now is

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,840
going to lead towards more openness for

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,580
tensorflow and that's going to be great

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,250
for everyone involved it's going to move

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,629
a eye forward great well thanks again

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,629
