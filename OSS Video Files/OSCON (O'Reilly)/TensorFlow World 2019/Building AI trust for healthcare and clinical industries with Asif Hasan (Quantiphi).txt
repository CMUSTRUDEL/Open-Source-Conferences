hi Roger here with us if Hassan is the

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,300
co-founder of quantify welcome Thank You

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,400
Roger so economic viability of AI a big

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,620
topic what do you think this is going to

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,859
happen in terms of like health and just

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,289
the benefit of humanity yeah great

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,250
question Roger and so I think you know

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,920
there are two kind of broad areas of

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,349
progress that we need to make right so

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,840
the first is the the technology itself

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:35,550
right and we are seeing just an enormous

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,700
pace of innovation from a technology

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,940
standpoint within healthcare so there's

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,050
a whole variety of tasks from a clinical

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,989
standpoint at an administrative

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,739
standpoint which AI is able to do very

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:53,070
well like for example there's you know

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,370
radiology related scenarios where AI is

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,410
able to read radiological scans at near

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,920
human sometimes above human levels of

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,650
accuracy there are things like detecting

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,780
diabetic retinopathy things like

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,590
detecting early onset of Alzheimer's

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,840
using speech patterns and even

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:16,049
discovering new drug molecules and all

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,659
of these areas are where AI has proven

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,170
to be quite effective so the technology

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:26,009
itself is moving along in a way that it

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,680
can have widespread impact the headwinds

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,950
that we are seeing is in the actual

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,840
adoption of these technologies in the

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,210
clinical and administrative workflows

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,049
and there are two broad challenges there

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,180
its organizational and its regulatory so

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,360
from an organizational standpoint the

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,360
key issue is building trust in AI

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,280
systems so there's you know some

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,430
concerns around job security there's

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,619
concerns around bias explained ability

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,110
of models and all these things are

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,409
creating some level of nervousness in

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,200
terms of what is AI going to be able to

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,259
accomplish in this domain and so there

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,349
are some question marks there the from a

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,970
regulatory standpoint you have

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:16,060
challenges around data privacy

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,610
HIPAA compliance and and these issues as

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,830
well as the timeline and the costs of

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,280
getting an AI solution through the FDA

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:27,220
approval channels is also a pretty long

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,320
and expensive and so these are and these

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,450
are all justifiable areas where you

00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,920
would want a certain level of oversight

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,440
but that is slowing down the adoption of

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,800
Texas technology to the broad ecosystem

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,170
and the masses right what we are seeing

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,930
though is there is a small group of

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:51,160
clinicians and administrators who are as

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:54,180
excited if not more excited as we are on

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,410
the the transformative potential of AI

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,870
and this makes us very very optimistic

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,020
that in the not-so-distant future we

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,460
will see widespread adoption so so what

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,470
kind of problems in particular is

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:09,550
qualified working on in healthcare yeah

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:12,130
so there is the broad you know I mean a

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,140
macro sense what we have seen is that

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,540
over the last several years we have

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,930
gotten really really good at capturing

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:23,200
data within clinical workflows through

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:26,290
EHR systems and things like that what we

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,260
have not seen is the ability to make

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,360
meaningful use of this data apply a AI

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,820
techniques to improve clinical and

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,100
administrative workflows and there are

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,800
two areas in particular where the

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,560
challenge is particularly severe so

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,500
there's a large volume of imaging data

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,200
that exists in healthcare and then there

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,930
is a large volume of clinical notes

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,770
encounters etc which is freeform text

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,989
that is buried inside EHR systems now

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,080
because this data can't be neatly

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,480
organized in rows and columns it's very

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,190
hard for humans to analyze this right

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,310
and this is where machine learning

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,620
techniques come in and so we are in

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,950
particular focused around these two

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,989
areas right the ability to apply imaging

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,940
data and the ability to apply machine

00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:22,060
learning techniques to clinical notes to

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,740
be able to transform clinical and

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,050
administrative processes so as an

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,330
example

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:33,150
we've worked with a very prestigious

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:35,759
system in the Maryland area to develop a

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,740
model that takes in a CT image and it

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,380
can estimate the volume of blood clots

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,410
in a brain trauma situation at a level

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,380
of accuracy that is at or above human

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,770
level we've also worked with another

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,220
healthcare technology and pharmaceutical

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:55,410
company to detect lung diseases that are

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,300
very very hard to detect right so those

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,169
you know just the general area of

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,900
applying machine learning to images to

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,000
improve the speed and accuracy with

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,340
which clinicians can make their

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,610
inference is one that we are going after

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,970
in a big way the other area is of course

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:18,389
the unstructured clinical notes and

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:22,080
there we are working to be able to apply

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:25,020
that to curate data for the purposes of

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,960
outcomes research right so we are

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,389
actually giving a talk tomorrow

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,210
afternoon where we are going to

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,099
demonstrate that we work with a large

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,090
healthcare system in the Pacific

00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:42,389
Northwest and to take their clinical

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,360
notes data and then abstract from there

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,550
you know entirely automated way the

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,250
scenarios where cancer has recurred and

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,550
this typically takes human abstractors

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,280
in a manual process up to a year to do

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,159
this task and push that data into the

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,330
you know cancer registries and now this

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,310
is happening in minutes

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,500
so these are kind of two areas that we

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,169
are going after in a you know you know

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,240
significant way so how do you see the

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,409
future happening like what is your role

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,169
in creating that future yeah so I think

00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:19,259
there's I mean the given the pace at

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:23,219
which things are moving right it sort of

00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:26,069
makes the future you know somewhat

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:29,759
unpredictable in sort of a micro sense

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:32,520
but in a macro sense there is a research

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,590
that had read from a very

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,230
research institution that pegged the

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,510
economic impact of AI over the next

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,700
decade at about 15 trillion dollars

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:46,690
globally right what was interesting

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:51,030
there is that a third of that about five

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:53,890
trillion is what came from substitution

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,200
and automation so what I mean by that is

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,240
you know machines doing tasks that today

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,120
humans are doing and this is the area

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,910
that most people get quite concerned and

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,670
anxious about but what was even more

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,310
interesting is that two-thirds of the

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,470
impact about ten trillion was coming

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,290
from entirely new products and services

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:18,460
that we today can't even comprehend

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:20,650
right and so and this is the area that

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,230
will create new and interesting jobs

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,600
will spawn entirely new business models

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,000
and things like that and so this is what

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,910
makes us very very excited so the role

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:37,660
that we see for our organization is to

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:40,150
help organizations understand where a I

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,890
will make a transformative impact on

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,590
their business model right that's that's

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,720
number one and number two to actually

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,270
then go ahead and help them build out

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,180
these solutions so we see ourselves as

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,120
as advisors as architects and engineers

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,670
in helping clients transform their

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,940
business with AI so how do you see

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,680
tensorflow fitting into this yeah so I

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,730
mean tensorflow

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,610
has helped us address a class of

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,730
problems in a very practical and

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,030
cost-effective way that up until a few

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,920
years ago we could not even dream of

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,350
addressing right so this whole area of

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,250
applying deep learning algorithms at

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:26,230
scale to datasets that can't be neatly

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,930
organized into rows and columns and

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,630
doing interesting machine learning and

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,150
AI tasks with that is an area where

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,360
tensorflow has been instrumental so when

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,520
we first started using tensor flow this

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,490
was late November you know it's late

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,610
2015 timeframe when tensor flow was open

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,650
source we were a team of about 80 people

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,880
today we're a team of about thousand

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:55,740
people so we have grown twelve fold in

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,860
the last three and a half four ish years

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,750
largely through the application of deep

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,900
learning techniques to interesting

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:09,070
problems in computer vision speech

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,350
natural language etc helping businesses

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,960
build more intelligent products helping

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,020
them make their customer experience

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,420
frictionless helping them make their

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,340
processes automated and in some cases

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,340
autonomous as well as detecting

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,620
anomalies in risks in their business and

00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,220
make their businesses safer right so

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,460
these are the types of tasks that

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:35,050
tensorflow has allowed us to address and

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,240
and these were of course you can make

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,000
the case that pre tensorflow you could

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:43,380
have done the same things through

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,650
application of other you know software

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:52,620
but to do it in a cost-effective way

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,620
and to do it in a way that is

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,470
technologically feasible at scale is

00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,900
something that we just could not have

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,420
done right so in that sense on that
