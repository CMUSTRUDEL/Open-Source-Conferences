hi I'm Ted summary from Twitter before I

00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:10,250
get started my conversation today I want

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,110
to do a quick plug for Twitter what's

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,929
great about events like this is you get

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,789
to hear people like Jeff Dean talk and

00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:18,260
you also get to hear from colleagues and

00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,330
people in the industry that are facing

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,610
similar challenges is you and have

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,740
conversations around developments and

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,790
data science and machine learning but

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,010
what's great is that's actually

00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,780
available every day on Twitter Twitter's

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,580
phenomenal for conversation on data

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,930
science and machine learning people like

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,219
Jeff Dean and other thought leaders are

00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,840
constantly sharing their thoughts and

00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,180
their developments and you can follow

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,140
that conversation and engage in it and

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,970
only that but you can bring that

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,860
conversation back to your workplace and

00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,660
come off looking like a hero just

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:49,970
something to consider so without that

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,110
shameless plug my name's Ted Sammy I

00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,640
lead product for cortex

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,559
cortex is Twitter central machine

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
learning organization if you have any

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,649
questions for me or the team feel free

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,170
to connect with me on Twitter and we can

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,969
follow up later so before we get into

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,710
how we're accelerating ml at Twitter

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,049
let's talk a little bit about how are

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,060
you been using ml at Twitter Twitter's

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,010
largely organized against three customer

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,870
needs the first of which is our health

00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,340
initiative that might be a little bit

00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,680
confusing to you you might think of it

00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,330
as user safety but we think about it as

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,760
improving the health of conversations on

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,700
Twitter and machine learning is already

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,770
at use here we use it to detect spam we

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,190
can algorithm tickle you not scale to

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,690
tech spam and protect our users from

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,689
similarly in the abuse space we can

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,180
proactively flag content as potentially

00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:37,070
abuse toss it up for human reviews and

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,280
act on it before our users even get

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,810
impacted by it a third space where we're

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,210
using machine owning here is something

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,950
called NSFW not-safe-for-work I think

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,960
you're all familiar with the acronym so

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,630
how can we at scale identify this

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,740
content and handle it accordingly

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,810
another use of machine learning in this

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,890
space there's more that we want to do

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,049
here and there's more that we're already

00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,700
doing

00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,290
similarly the consumer organization this

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,509
is largely what you think of the big

00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,150
blue app of Twitter and here the

00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,680
customer job we're serving is helping

00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,030
connect our customers with the

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,489
conversations on Twitter that they're

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,050
interested in and one of the primary

00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,090
veins that wouldn't which we do this is

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,170
our time line our time line today is

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,450
ranked so if you're not familiar you

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,340
follow accounts content and tweets

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,860
associated with those accounts get

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,390
funneled into a central feed and we

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,160
ranked that based on your past

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,680
engagement an interest to make sure we

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,550
bring forth the most development and

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,450
most relevant conversations for you now

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,459
there's lots of conversations on Twitter

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,930
and you're not following everyone and so

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,819
there's also a job that we have to serve

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,660
about bringing forth all the

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,459
conversations that you're not

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,709
proactively following but are still

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,390
relevant to you this is surfaced in our

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,280
recommendations product which uses

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,410
machine learning to scan the corpus of

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,480
content on Twitter and identify what

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,950
conversations be mowing most interesting

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,790
to you and push it to you in a

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,530
notification the inverse of that is when

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,209
you cuz you know what the topics you

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,769
want to explore are but you're looking

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,630
for the conversations around that that's

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,040
where we use Twitter search this is

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,459
another surface area and the big blue

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,110
app that we're using machine learning

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,730
the third job to be done for our

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,130
customers is helping connect brands with

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,780
their customers you might think of this

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,850
as the ads product and this is actually

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,620
the og of machine learning at Twitter

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,510
the first team that implemented it and

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,430
here we use it for what you might expect

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,350
ads ranking that's kind of like the

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,900
timeline ranking but instead of tweets

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,049
its ads and identifying most relevant

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,570
ads for our users and as signals to go

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,040
into that we also do user targeting to

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,170
understand your past engagement ads

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,010
understand which ads or are in your

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,690
interest space and the third oh yeah

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,370
it's really good and the third is brand

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,329
safety you might not think about this

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,030
when you think about machine learning

00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,799
and advertising but if you're a company

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,510
like United and you wanna advertise on

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,670
Twitter you want to make sure that your

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,160
ad never shows up next to a tweet about

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,739
a plane crash so how do we at scale

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,870
protect our brands from those off-brand

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,600
conversations we use machine learning

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,489
for this as well so as you can tell

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,920
machine learning is a big part of all of

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,120
these organizations today and where we

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,890
have shared interests and shared

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,389
investment we want to make sure we have

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,280
a shared organization that serves that

00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:16,280
and that's the need for cortex

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,230
central machine-learning team and our

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,630
purpose is really quite simple to enable

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,180
Twitter with ethical and advanced AI and

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,610
to serve that purpose we've organized in

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,250
three ways the first is our applied

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,110
research group this group applies the

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,120
most advanced MLT techniques from

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,100
industry and research to our most

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,300
important surface areas whether they be

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,770
new initiatives or existing places this

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,900
team you can kind of think of as like an

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,460
internal task force or consultancy that

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,270
we can redeploy against the companies

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,270
top initiatives

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,990
can his signals when using machine

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,300
learning having shared data assets that

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,280
are broadly useful can provide as more

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,290
leverage examples of this would be our

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,300
language understanding team that looks

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,430
at tweets and identifies named entities

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,200
inside them those can then be offered up

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,910
as features for other teams to consume

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,550
in their own applications of machine

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,440
learning similarly our media

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,270
understanding team looks at images and

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,340
can create a fingerprint of any image

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,560
and therefore we can identify every use

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,120
of that image across the platform these

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,160
are examples shared signals that we're

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,730
producing that can be used for machine

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,470
learning at scale inside the company and

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,630
the third organization is our platform

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,970
team and this is really the origins of

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,220
cortex here we provide tools and

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,560
infrastructure to accelerate ml

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,510
development at Twitter we increase the

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,100
velocity of our ml practitioners and

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,349
this is really the focus of the

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,330
conversation today

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,550
when we set out to build this ML

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,069
platform we decided we wanted a shared

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,509
ml platform across all of Twitter and

00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,770
why is that important that it be shared

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,020
across all of Twitter well we want

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,539
transferability we want the great work

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,969
being done in the ads team to be where

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,369
possible transferable to the to benefit

00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:05,050
the health initiative where that's

00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:07,809
relevant and similarly if we have great

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,520
talent in the consumer team that's

00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:11,259
interested in moving to the ads team if

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,020
they're on the same platform they can

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:16,479
transfer without friction be able to

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,309
ramp up quickly so we set out with this

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,529
goal of having a shared ml platform

00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:21,699
across all of Twitter and when we did

00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:24,159
that we looked at a couple of product

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,719
requirements first it needs to be

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:28,719
scalable it needs to be able to operate

00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:31,119
a Twitter scale the second it needs to

00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:32,619
be adaptable this space is developing

00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:34,330
quickly so we need a platform that can

00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,969
evolve with data science and machine

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,319
learning developments third is the

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:39,699
talent pool we want to make sure that we

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,369
have a development environment Twitter

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,749
that appeals to the ml researchers and

00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:47,559
engineers that we're hiring and

00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:49,330
developing fourth is the ecosystem we

00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,439
want to be able to lean on the partners

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,539
that are built developing

00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,919
industry-leading tools so we can focus

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,249
on technologies that are Twitter

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,349
specific fourth is documentation that

00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,699
you want to understand that we want to

00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,159
be able to quickly unblock our

00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,069
practitioners as they hit issues which

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:07,539
was inevitable in any platform and

00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:09,699
finally usability we want to remove

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:12,309
friction and frustration from the lives

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,459
of our team so that they can focus on

00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:17,379
delivering value for our end customers

00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,999
so considering these product

00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,240
requirements let's see how tensorflow

00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:24,060
has done against them

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,560
first is scalability we validated this

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,509
by putting tensorflow

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,240
by way of our implementation we call

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,680
deep Bird against timeline ranking so

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,930
every tweet that's ranked in the

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,660
timeline today runs through tensorflow

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,660
so we can consider that test validated

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,820
second is adaptability the novel

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,170
architectures that tends to evoke and

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,170
support as well as the custom loss

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,640
functions allows us to react to the

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,920
latest research and I'm employed that

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,350
inside the company an example that we

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,000
published on this publicly is our use of

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,190
a split net architecture and adds

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,250
ranking so tense flow has been great

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,630
very adaptable for us

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,800
third is the talent pool and we think

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,430
about the talent pool in kind of two

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,290
types

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,950
there's the mo engineer and the ml

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,420
researcher and as a proxy of these

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,580
audiences we looked at the github data

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,850
on these and clearly tensorflow is

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,800
widely adopted amongst ml engineers and

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,450
similarly the archive community shows

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,600
strong evidence of light adoption in the

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,490
academic community on top of this proxy

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,470
data we've also have anecdotal evidence

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,140
of the speed of ramp up for our male

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,120
researchers and ml engineers inside the

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,950
company

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,920
and fourth is the ecosystem whether it's

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,670
tensor board T of data validation TF

00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,230
model analysis TF meta story of hub TFT

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,610
effects pipelines there's a slew of

00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,130
these products out there and they're

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,320
phenomenal they allow us to focus on

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,480
developing tools and infrastructure that

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,370
is specific to Twitter's needs and lead

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,720
on the great work of others so we're

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,640
really grateful for this intense fluid

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,890
is great here v being documentation now

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,490
this is what you would go to when you go

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,470
to tensorflow

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,390
and you see that phenomenal

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,250
documentation as well as great education

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,750
resources but what you might not

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,700
appreciate we've come to really

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,080
appreciate is the value of the

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,240
user-generated content

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,440
what Stack Overflow and other platforms

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,810
can provide in terms of user-generated

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,190
content is almost as valuable as

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,870
anything tensorflow itself can create

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,700
and so tensorflow

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,830
giving it's a widespread adoption and

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,810
it's great tensorflow website has

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,440
provided phenomenal documentation for ml

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,440
practitioners

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:35,600
finally usability and this is why we're

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,699
really excited about tensorflow 2.0 the

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,740
orientation around the Charis api makes

00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,509
it more user friendly it also still

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,360
continues to allow for flexibility for

00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,009
more advanced users the eager execution

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,230
enables more rapid and intuitive

00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:51,110
debugging and it closes the gap between

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,839
mo engineers and modelers so clearly

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,279
from this checklist we're pretty happy

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,649
with our engagement with tensorflow

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,449
we're excited about continuing developed

00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,389
a platform with them and push the limits

00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:03,410
on what it can do

00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:04,730
gratitude to the community for their

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,560
participation their involvement in the

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,880
product and appreciate their

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,940
conversation on Twitter and as we

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,319
advance it so if you have any questions

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,089
for me as I said before you can connect

00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,889
with me but I'm not alone here today a

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,269
bunch of my colleagues are here as well

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:19,790
so if you see them roaming the halls

00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:21,620
feel free to engage with them or as I

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,509
shared before you can continue the

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,160
conversation on Twitter here are their

00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,160
