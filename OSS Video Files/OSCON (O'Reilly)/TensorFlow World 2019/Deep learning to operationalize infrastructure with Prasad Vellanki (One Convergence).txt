hi Roger McGough is here with Prasad

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,600
malenky he's the CEO of one convergence

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,290
welcome Oh Thank You Roger

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,590
so what are the kind of made obstacles

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,379
and gaps for people deploying AI but how

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,260
does one convergence work with that so

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,590
our our product and the company is

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,420
focused on mostly on the deep learning

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,420
but we do cover generic area ml too but

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,650
where we are focusing on is

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,070
operationalizing the infrastructure so

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,230
what that means is taking a data as data

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,239
scientist gets on board how do you kind

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,360
of make that whole process a very

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,950
efficient so if I look at the the and we

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,910
are very much focused on the enterprise

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,129
and on pram

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,850
if I look at where they are there are

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,430
there are a few gaps one is on Prem as a

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,079
has been kind of the area

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,690
operationalizing that is been it is a

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,390
major gap particularly around this whole

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,059
machine learning area the cloud hyper

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,189
scalars have done a very good job at

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,420
operationalizing we have like hundreds

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,580
of people maybe thousands of people

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,600
looking at the infrastructure making

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,090
very efficient and making it very easy

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,920
but on an enterprise side it's not there

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,159
yet and now you combine that with deep

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,259
learning where it requires a lot more

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,560
okay I mean it has more features more

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,320
capacity more hardware it's it

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,460
significantly increases the whole

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,159
complexity of it

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,500
so those are the two gaps what we see

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,450
what we very we kind of look at it and

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,250
then say how do you kind of take the and

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,869
wire might where Enterprise are used to

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,000
making it more like a CI CD process

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,530
they're used to and then and then make

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,149
it like efficient that way so that's

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,860
that's basically where we will look at

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,780
the gaps are so this is your D cube and

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,890
so where's your vision of weird kind of

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,500
ml OPS's is going and what's so we are

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,149
looking at a where the product where we

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,399
are looking at is this kind of kind of

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,799
solving it into end as opposed to kind

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,250
of taking a point and of a particular

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,170
operation

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,640
in all things and then solving that so

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,270
what I mean by that is if I look at it

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,300
you know in a operationalize deep

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,220
learning or m/l the three parts one is

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,780
the rapid prototyping where the data

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,330
scientist comes on board and then kind

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,459
of rapidly kind of creates a model then

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,470
the model once it kind of we satisfied

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,390
it he wants to run through the whole

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,890
training process which is called what

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,470
what I call production ization of the

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,120
model so that is that that's that's all

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,620
the person different piece of running

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,670
across the whole infrastructure it could

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,950
involve sometimes 1 to 15 has many GPUs

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,810
with like a lot of storage access and

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,670
all of that and the third one is once

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,140
you are done with the satisfied in the

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,020
model now you need to put it into

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,060
production with one of the things of hi

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,070
is that at least in this process is a

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,020
continuous process it's not like once

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,090
you kind of go into production your data

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,470
might not be exactly the same thing as

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,420
you do what you trained with therefore

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,250
you need to recognize is my model going

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,480
to be decaying in which case they need

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,970
to come back and then say I need a

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,770
retrain again so this happens in some

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,230
industries it's pretty much continuous

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,090
it's like happens like on a daily basis

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,190
because new objects come in so you have

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,080
to retrain and all of that so now how do

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,850
you make this whole thing efficient how

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,190
do you make that so that it can take the

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,040
whole operations I take from the data

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,299
scientist right so that's basically what

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,280
we're trying to do so we're trying to

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,910
address the whole into end of this whole

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,650
process okay so how does DQ compared to

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,100
your competitors and in this open source

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,019
world some of them are probably free

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,720
absolutely so d cube in terms of their

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,790
one is we are kind of built it right

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,370
from the get-go we participate heavily

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,440
in the community so there's a open

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,140
source project called cube flow which is

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,549
basically we are built on top of it and

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,410
the second part of it is there are other

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,269
open sources we can incorporate mine is

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,610
a tensor flow we are very kind of the

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,320
highly optimized for tensor flow while

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,790
we support other information learning

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,680
infrastructures what tensorflow has been

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,829
our prime focus because that's where a

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,260
lot of distributed kind of deep learning

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,930
is is very high implemented very well

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,660
and the third part of that is

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,420
and we are built for we're built on top

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,690
of communities so that means right from

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,830
the get-go we looked at it and said we

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,690
want to build on a cloud native

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,180
infrastructure so that it's kind of

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,160
mobile it can kind of suit the hybrid

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,540
environment well while on Prem is highly

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,810
optimized you should be able to move

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,669
between the clouds and things like that

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,870
and those are the few and then most of

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,850
the ML infrastructures have been

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,800
developed before these open-sourcing

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,110
have happened or kind of build the

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,360
infrastructure so we kind of built it on

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,980
top of the existing what the community

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,200
is been going towards right so that's

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,390
the big advantage already and then we

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,790
are hardening so from open source

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,669
perspective open source solves very well

00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,290
in terms of like 80% of the way what but

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,760
enterprises especially in the deep

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,770
learning area I need to integrate with

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,150
their security infrastructure their

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,130
storage infrastructure you need to

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,980
optimize for that and then these are

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,419
like I mean large expensive machines so

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,400
how do you kind of deal with that and

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,680
operationalize that so that's where we

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,780
kind of differentiated and also kind of

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,340
gonna compete with various products in

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,120
them which are there in the market

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:25,450
mm-hmm so you mostly focus on Prem and

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,720
given how much the public cloud has

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:32,290
become a thing the last few years why

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,240
the focus on trend and with public lot

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,640
is great right so some people the way we

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,290
see it is a lot of people kind of start

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,500
off with public cloud they go to public

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,180
cloud very quickly get it up and going

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,040
there are few reasons there one is there

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,860
is a compliance regulatory reasons where

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,540
your data cannot leave the unpromising

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,060
do you need your computer where the data

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,890
is so our notion is take your compete

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,870
where in the data is whether it's on

00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,729
Prem cloud doesn't matter just kind of

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,550
execute the compute environment where

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,350
the data is so so from that point of

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,880
view then a second part of it is can it

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,280
kind of gets expensive as a data

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,169
increases so your storage requirements

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,240
your computer acquirements and all of

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,610
that become very expensive so between

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,200
those two things what we feel that's

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,550
where we are kind of trying to focus on

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,310
and then make

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,750
so why don't you sectors do you focus on

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,930
them I can make some guesses given

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:27,230
beyond crab right so one big area is of

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,790
course healthcare and pharma and all of

00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,410
those where there's a lot of drug

00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,050
discovery going on there's a lot of

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,030
images data the second one is

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,100
manufacturing so people are looking at

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,500
like video data can I use the video data

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,660
can I make it really efficient can I

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,490
discover new things they defects and

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,020
things like that so those are the two

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,450
kind of areas but there are other areas

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,440
which are kind of security and Lanier's

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,840
which come into play too

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,670
so but but the focus for us is on the

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,930
health one is of course the pharma

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,570
health care and the second one the

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,520
manufacturing side great well thanks for

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,700
your time today thank you thank you very

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,700
