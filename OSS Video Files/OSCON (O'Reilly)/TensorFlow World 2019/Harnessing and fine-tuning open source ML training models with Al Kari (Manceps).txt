hi I'm Roger Margolis and I'm with Al

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,050
Kerry the CEO of mance EPS welcome thank

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,240
you it's nice meeting you so here at the

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,309
tensorflow conference we're seeing a lot

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,859
going on what he think is behind the AI

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,510
revolution were seeing here oh god a lot

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,070
of things are happening and I think I

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,630
want to start with a little story

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,340
if anybody read Dilbert and the initial

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,130
stories that started scott adams in

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,750
writing was about how humanity started

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,399
and how there were some monkeys and then

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,320
somebody started writing and then

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,790
somebody invented the printing press and

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,390
when someone invented that printing

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,610
press a lot of people got smarter and

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,559
then one day someone invented the

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,809
internet and that's when things got so

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,200
good because we got a lot more smarter

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,059
and with AI things are accelerating so

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,579
much but if you think about the

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,030
components of AI how I came about today

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,649
how did we get to see all these

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,460
technologies if you think about break it

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,199
down to the core parts of it think about

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,080
all the data we've been collecting that

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,549
has been a phenomenal wealth that we did

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,200
not know how to use in the past and

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,979
today we're actually doing so much

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,240
better at understanding data and

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,040
processing it properly and feature

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,009
engineering to actually get meaningful

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,590
insights out of it in addition to the

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,900
data revolution of course there was the

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,310
hardware expansion the ability the new

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,080
abilities were seeing with better

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,909
hardware every day the better

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,659
algorithms are being developed every day

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,820
but if you think about this the cloud

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,610
made for something phenomenal to happen

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,700
the cloud made everyone able to take

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,860
that data with a credit card and process

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,049
massive jobs of training and learning

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,950
from that data with with just a little

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,899
bit of money and that really helped a

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,020
whole new breed of startups that use

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,579
that those new technologies to start new

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,740
services and offer new offerings and

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,689
products that helped really with all the

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,369
stuff that is happening all around us

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,740
which we are accepting slowly and

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,050
gradually but if you think about it if

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,300
you tell someone who was at the time

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,680
when scott adams wrote his first Dilbert

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,310
book

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,980
would think of as science fiction in

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,140
addition to all that the community

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,269
developed this new concept over time

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,370
called open source an open source made

00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:28,010
things so much better we started

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,109
building incremental incrementally on

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,480
top of the shoulders of giants so we

00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:34,280
learned from the past we open source our

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,750
products we open source our code the

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,420
open source our technologies and

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,159
somebody else improves a little bit on

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,450
top of it and makes it a little bit

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,650
better and someone else makes it a

00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,720
little bit better incremental

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,970
improvement and we are progressing so

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,120
much faster than the past almost

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,730
exponentially and finally I think what's

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,099
enabling this really is all the great

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,170
work that is available for free by

00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,030
trainers that are helping millions of

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,980
people learn the technology and get

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,139
passionate about it and understand it

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,840
better a new generation is starting to

00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,720
learn about things that have that are

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
significantly complex by just watching

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,500
YouTube videos or watching online

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,959
training and building some amazing

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,120
products some high schoolers are now

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,680
coming out with products right off of

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,180
their high school before they even get

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,859
to college because they're able to learn

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,510
all these technologies super quick

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:25,250
yeah just for what it's worth a rally

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,040
has a learning platform to that a lot of

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,720
people use to get that knowledge yeah so

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,900
a lot of companies are under a lot of

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,180
pressure to automate but it's behind all

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,329
that well think about that Roger if

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,669
you're if you're that company that's

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,669
selling products and you're not

00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:47,209
implementing AI today well Jeff Bezos is

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:49,729
and if you're not worried about losing

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,790
your customers because you can't even

00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,709
keep up with their new requirements

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,879
their needs and address their demands on

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,669
a one-on-one basis

00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,159
somebody else is doing that if you're

00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:03,199
into content delivery and you're not

00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,389
thinking about how to tailor to the

00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,000
tastes of your of your customers or your

00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:10,699
viewers when Netflix is thinking about

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,569
that and if you are if you're into

00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:17,389
logistics or supply channels supply

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,459
chain channels if you haven't started

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,500
thinking about ways to optimize that

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,280
they I when Walmart have done that and

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,110
you know we are seeing a number of

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,440
companies go out of business very

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,240
quickly just with other companies using

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,470
techniques or technologies that allow

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,270
them to learn better about their

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:39,319
customers in fact if you think about

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:43,580
this 52 percent of the fortune 500 list

00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:45,620
from the year 2010 is gone 52 percent of

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,259
those companies and guess what who would

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,020
have thunk a company with an app like

00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,570
uber would unseat an established taxi

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,610
industry and become the 60 billion giant

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,550
company that it is today it would have

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,680
thunk that something that disruptive

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,270
could happen to an industry that existed

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,400
for thousands of years who could have

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,729
thunk that a company like Sears that

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,039
owned almost a database of every

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:14,810
individual on the face of this continent

00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:17,180
and failed to use that data for actually

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,270
learning from it and delivering results

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:24,130
through it is on the verge of bankruptcy

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,300
it's it's it's very disruptive and that

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,880
disrupting disruption is all over the

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,440
place it's across the board every

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,930
industry is going to be touched and it's

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,900
going to be all around us we either

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,849
adapt and those companies that are smart

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,639
enough to actually adapt and jump on it

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,250
are really maintaining their competitive

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,900
advantage over others so that kind of

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,300
leads to so there's this great need for

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,820
AI and a lot of businesses probably that

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,560
aren't ready for it needed to be

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,620
how does man steps fit in what does even

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:59,750
man steps mean and yeah max is actually

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:03,440
Latin for customers it actually is a it

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:06,650
it represents our focus and commitment

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,509
to our customers and we are a research

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,870
and engineering company headquartered in

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:14,060
Portland Oregon we work specifically on

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,639
the AI machine learning space we help

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,430
develop solutions and scale those

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,009
solutions out for our customers and we

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:26,900
take AI to the next level we not only

00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:28,820
take data and help drive insights from

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,209
it but we also help take that data and

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,699
serve it

00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,799
in a scale-out fashion to customers all

00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,969
around the world so where companies

00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,469
might be interested in what you're doing

00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:40,559
how would they get a hold of you or find

00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:43,829
out more well we are headquartered in

00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:45,299
Portland like I said but we work across

00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,829
the country and the United States in

00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:48,839
North America and we're starting to

00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,119
operate globally we can be reached at

00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,309
Manchester I and there's a lot of

00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,839
details there on how to engage and we

00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:56,279
look forward to working with you we

00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,289
really look forward to hearing what

00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,269
problems our customers have and what

00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:03,059
issues we could solve for them we have a

00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:04,949
significant significant deep brilliant

00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:07,199
team of data scientists and machine

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,599
learning engineers that are hungry to

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,299
solve problems and are really excited

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,869
about all these applications that are on

00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:17,009
the world that we can help solve so you

00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,959
can't describe someone how you're

00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,519
helping customers but in particular what

00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,489
kind of things are you helping them with

00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,469
him think about think about the

00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:27,209
technologies we're building things think

00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:29,069
about all of these solutions that are

00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:31,079
coming out so fast everything is

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,449
evolving very quickly when you talk

00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,309
about tensorflow for example a major

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,860
framework that's being used for building

00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:39,509
AI systems today tensorflow had a major

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,029
release every two months for the past

00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:45,059
two years it's moving so fast and it's

00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:48,659
it's really building to deliver

00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:50,459
significant value by by adapting some of

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:53,729
the libraries that are already built and

00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:56,129
a lot of that is moving much faster than

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,489
a lot of companies can adapt to and the

00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,809
way we operate we help customers by

00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:03,449
initially introducing them to AI

00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:05,099
concepts and how that could work if they

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,999
are in a green field and they haven't

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:11,129
gotten any AI yet we start by optimizing

00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:13,769
some of their systems with some AI

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:19,319
systems that could work with some of

00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:22,379
their data we also put that into a

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,989
learning mode and start slowly moving

00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,889
them and to an optimizer optimize an

00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:32,039
Augmented fashion so as they as they as

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,529
they're new systems are optimized they

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,279
start learning from their operator the

00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,660
human operators they get to

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,110
incrementally start

00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,940
augmenting and one day when we have

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,820
enough training data and and when the

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,400
systems are delivering enough confidence

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,860
we flip the switch when we flip that

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,080
switch the human operator stays it

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,050
continue the person continues to

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,500
actually operate the system but only for

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,840
anomalies and for exceptions and the AI

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,550
system handles the the majority of the

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,530
workload and that allows the human

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,090
operator to go on to doing better and

00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,010
bigger things and more important things

00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:15,330
and things that require more creativity

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,980
and more thought-out processes so as

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,900
anyone who plays in the data space knows

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,700
data is really important data quality is

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,470
really important what about customers

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,240
who don't have enough or the right kind

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,830
of data that's that that's a really good

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
question right I think it's it's very

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,490
important to realize there are so many

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
ways to actually acquiring data you

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,110
don't need to have data yourself there

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,650
are massive repositories of data sets

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,960
that could fit your use case we for just

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,240
that initial learning before we actually

00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,880
start with full-on automation as we

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,920
start get into the augmentation space we

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,270
could use other resources data there but

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,040
big data says there are data sets that

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,590
you could buy but there's also one more

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,550
important thing that is so amazing with

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:59,400
the open source movement we are actually

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,860
seeing large companies take massive

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,200
datasets and train models with them and

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,730
open sourcing them like take birth for

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,920
example a language model that was

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,590
trained with all the knowledge of the

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,390
internet with Wikipedia and the New York

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,510
Times and everything to understand

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,010
language it takes about it cost about

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,230
two hundred fifty thousand dollars in

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,790
GPU time costs in the cloud

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,610
only to train that model with that kind

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,260
of data and Google just took on that

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,240
cost and trained it and made it

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,230
available publicly so you could actually

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,540
take that model use it for a starting

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,500
point and then train it or fine-tune it

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,730
with a specific problem data and use it

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,920
to actually make better and better

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,100
reference as it rains more that is

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,770
specific to a problem a few of our

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,200
students and the local school district

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,879
in the high school students through our

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,600
internship Summer of Code program

00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:59,410
took that model and used it to

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,300
unredacted documents they were very

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,569
successful at actually producing an

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,910
redactor comm a app that will allow you

00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:09,009
to write text redacted and then let the

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,050
model predict what is what has been

00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:15,459
redacted I think we all know why we need

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,259
that and the the other thing is that

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,329
those models can be trained with a

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,949
specific type of data for example they

00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:23,649
could be trained on legal documents they

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:27,850
could be trained on medical documents so

00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:31,089
we're able to take things like a domain

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,429
that has a lot of a lot of content a lot

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,379
of documents digitized that those

00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:37,329
documents and then use models and

00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:40,300
fine-tune those models with those

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:43,420
documents and summarize if you're an

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:46,629
attorney who is still reading hundreds

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,759
of pages before you do discovery or you

00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,980
have hundreds of paralegals sitting just

00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,889
browsing through thousands of pages to

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,949
get the main aspects of a case that you

00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:59,079
could go and and and litigate you're

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,999
really wasting a lot of time and effort

00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:02,799
an AI system could actually take

00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:06,279
multiple thousand documents and in

00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,129
minutes only generate a summary of the

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,230
most critical part of that case and help

00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,029
you really get to the key points that

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,100
you need to you need to pay attention to

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,679
not only you can do that you can also

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,499
correlate elements of that case between

00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,449
timelines other cases some of the

00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:26,949
information that are available publicly

00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:30,339
and and and that is adding superhuman

00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:32,679
capabilities to our law firms and in

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:34,779
customers in that space same thing can

00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,679
be applied to legal I'm sorry to medical

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,720
records so things like the all the

00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,269
information that providers exchanged

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,379
with insurers with suppliers and all

00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:49,629
that and doctors it's it's a lot of

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:53,410
documents a lot of text and all of that

00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:56,589
is takes a lot of time from someone with

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,720
an an MBA to just go through or some

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:01,480
some doctor to actually read a whole lot

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,940
of text just to make to come up with a

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:09,880
simple determination of a case being

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:13,060
this or that all of that is in the

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,590
language processing space is advancing

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,700
so quickly we now not only know the

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:22,030
sentiment behind the text we also

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,550
understand the meaning and the concepts

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,880
that are driving the intentions behind

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,160
the text that we're we're reading we see

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,010
computer vision advancing in so many

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,980
different ways and at our session here

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,650
at tensorflow world this year we

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:44,050
explored explored a an adversary attack

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:45,190
on neural networks problem where neural

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,260
networks could be potentially

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,030
manipulated with an adversary that's

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,600
also a neural network learning from all

00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:54,430
of them and attempting to break them we

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,890
demonstrated that life and we open

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,090
sourced it so we're gonna be happy to

00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,680
see what people think of that

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,040
we're hoping people will not use it

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,960
maliciously right so you talk about some

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,250
great examples of things that work if

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,690
you can do a little like separate the

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,940
hype from the reality in this space

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,540
which is like filled with oh yeah that's

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,500
actually fun that's my favorite topic so

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,420
so a lot of the hype around AI is around

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,160
but but Hollywood show this we're not

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,260
building the Terminator anymore

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,210
but are we close to self-driving cars

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,490
probably we are but not that close yet

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,530
but when you take that same concept and

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,590
apply to specific domains like the

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,730
agriculture for example agricultural

00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,050
automation is so much easier than

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,630
self-driving cars you don't run over

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,610
people when you're out in the fields you

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,930
don't have that risk or that that is

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,640
inherent with a self-driving option some

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,800
of the applications we keep hearing

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,570
about are advancing so fast and we're

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,380
seeing some amazing technologies coming

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:55,840
out of them but but a lot of the hype is

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,310
around things that could be done that we

00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,310
read in the science-fiction books

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:05,679
one of the things that I think are

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:08,649
really important to notice here machine

00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:12,039
learning and AI are systems that are

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:14,289
able to learn from its large number of

00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:16,089
dimensions if you're talking about a

00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:19,089
problem that has so many different

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:22,209
features to it that we in our limitation

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:27,129
are unable to understand because of our

00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:28,899
ability to handle that when you when you

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,119
train a machine with the

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:34,209
multidimensionality algorithms that we

00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:36,609
have today on something that is simple

00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:38,229
like take for example the weather you

00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:42,399
train it on what the weather patterns

00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:45,239
were and say the 2010 and you take

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,159
simple features like temperature clouds

00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:49,720
wind speed and so on I trained that

00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,429
network with it and then you take that

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,529
model each at you trained and you come

00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:55,989
and apply to today and try to predict

00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:57,759
the weather tomorrow it is actually able

00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,769
to predict the weather tomorrow much

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,599
better than the weatherman without

00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,139
knowing anything about the weather and

00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:06,909
that in itself is very powerful and

00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,519
actually helping us understand well

00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:10,539
maybe we were missing the the

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,859
dimensionality of the world around us

00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:16,629
and maybe that is something that as as

00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:18,459
its that the machines are gonna be

00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:20,499
capable of analyzing better than we do

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:22,059
and provide us with some insights we

00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:22,720
wouldn't we never were privy to in the

00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,209
first place

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,399
so I think there's a lot of hype around

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,220
what we see as as applications that

00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,470
there is also the flip side to that that

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,299
in some way machines could actually turn

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:38,889
out to be a lot more intelligent than we

00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:40,720
are in that aspect machines go into

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,029
general artificial intelligence is a

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,309
nice dream it's a beautiful plot for a

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:47,079
science-fiction movie but I don't think

00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:48,879
we should be driving that that's really

00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,829
not it should not be our ultimate goal

00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,989
our ultimate goal should be to utilize

00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:55,899
these new capabilities to have those

00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:57,039
superhuman skills right well thanks a

00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:01,049
lot for your time today thank you so

00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,049
