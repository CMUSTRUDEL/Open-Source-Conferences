hi my name is Kemal I'm the project

00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,220
director for tensorflow so earlier you

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,950
heard from Jeff and Megan about the prog

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,710
direction now what I'd like to talk

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,080
about is the most important part of what

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,100
we're building and that's the community

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,100
that's you

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,060
sorry we're just like thank you so as

00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:34,480
you've seen in the video we've had a

00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:37,629
great Roadshow 11 events spanning five

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,269
continents to connect the community with

00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:41,949
the tensorflow team I personally was

00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:45,760
very lucky to summer because I got to

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:48,040
travel some Rocco and Ghana and Shanghai

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,350
amongst other places just to meet the

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,860
community and to listen to your feedback

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,350
and we heard a lot of great things so as

00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,269
we were thinking about you know how can

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:02,199
we best help the community it really

00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:05,740
came down to three things first we would

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,930
like you to help you to connect with the

00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,520
larger community and to share the latest

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,750
and greatest of what you've been

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,939
building then we also would like you you

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,430
know we want to help you learn learn

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:20,890
about m/l learn about tensorflow and

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:24,100
then we want to help you contribute and

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,610
give back to the community so let's

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,009
start with connect so why connect well

00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,170
first the community the 10th floor

00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:36,719
community has really grown a lot it's

00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:40,659
huge it's 46 million downloads 2,100

00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,850
commuters and again I know that we've

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:44,770
been saying that all along but I really

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,109
want to say a huge thank you on behalf

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,560
of the tensorflow team for making the

00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:52,240
community what it is today another

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,659
aspect of the community that we're very

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,530
proud of is that it's truly global you

00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,780
know this is a revised map of our of our

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,909
getup stars and as you can see we're

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,999
covering all timezone and keep growing

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:09,250
so the community is huge it's truly

00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:11,950
global and I really want to think about

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,890
how can we bring the community closer

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,550
together and this is really what

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:22,000
initiated the idea of tensorflow world

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,520
we wanted to create an event for you we

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,720
want an event where you could come up

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,670
and connect with the rest of the

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,610
community and share what you've been

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,040
working on

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,890
and this has actually started

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,230
organically seven months ago the

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,900
tensorflow user group started and I

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,980
think now we have close to 50 the

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:48,090
largest one is in Korea has 46,000

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,770
members we have 15 in China so if you're

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,940
in the audience or in a live stream and

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,980
you're looking into this map and you're

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,320
thinking wait I don't see you know I

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,600
don't I don't see a dot where I live and

00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,220
you have tensorflow member that you're

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,110
connecting with and you want to start a

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,720
tensorflow user group well we'd like to

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,370
help you so please go to tents for gosh

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,500
community and we'll help you get it

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,570
started so that next year when we look

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
at this map we have dots all over the

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,260
place

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,670
so what about businesses we talk about

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,490
developer what about businesses one

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,560
thing we heard from businesses is you

00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,450
know they have this this business

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
problem they think I'm L can help them

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,130
but they're not sure how and that's a

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,340
huge missed opportunity when we look at

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:33,610
the staggering 13 trillion dollars that

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,140
AI will bring to the global economy over

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,130
the next decade so you have those

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,530
businesses on one side and then you have

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,790
partners on the other side you know who

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,400
know about ml they know how to use

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,580
tensorflow so how do we connect those

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,070
two well this was the inspiration for

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,380
launching our trusted partner pilot

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,350
program which helps you as a business

00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:00,520
connect to a partner will help you solve

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,740
your ml problem so if you go intense

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,860
further or you'll find more about our

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,360
trusted partner program just a couple

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,850
examples of cool things that they've

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,740
been working on one partner helped a

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,980
conference company shorten the insurance

00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,530
claim processing time using image

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,989
processing techniques another partner

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,549
helped a global med tech company by

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,340
automating the shipping labeling process

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,960
using object recognition technique and

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,729
you'll hear more from this partner later

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,250
today I encourage you to go check out

00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:32,470
the talks another aspect is that if

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,540
you're a partner and you're interested

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,590
in in in in getting in this program we

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,590
also would like to hear from you

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,910
talk about learn we've invested a lot in

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,690
producing quality material to help you

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,950
learn about ml and about tensorflow

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,470
one thing that we did over the summers

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,540
what was really exciting is for the

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,440
first time we were part of the google

00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,990
Summer of Code we had a lot of interest

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,300
we were able to select 20 very talented

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,190
student and they got to work the whole

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,090
summer with amazing mentors on a

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,340
tensorflow

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,030
engineering team and they worked on very

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:16,950
inspiring projects going from 2.0 to

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,720
swift's UJS to TF agents so we were so

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,180
excited with you know the success of

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,160
this program that we decided to

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,560
participate for the first time in the

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,410
Google coding program so this is the

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,320
same program but for pre-university

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:35,130
students from 1317 it's a global online

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,780
contest and introduces teenagers to the

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,500
world of you know contributing to open

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,970
source development so as i mentioned

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,580
we've invested a lot this year on ml

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,050
education material but one thing we

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,320
heard is that there's a lot of different

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,630
things and you know what you want is to

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,030
be guided through pathways of learning

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,990
so we're we've worked hard on that I'm

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,180
excited to announce the new learn ml

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,390
page on Center for org and what this is

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,170
is Learning Path curated for you by the

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:12,540
10th of 13 and organized by level so you

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,780
have from beginners to advanced you can

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,130
explore books courses and videos help

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,800
you improve your knowledge of machine

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,430
learning and use that knowledge and use

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,450
tensorflow

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,860
to solve your real world problem and for

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,170
more exciting news that will be

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:33,389
available on the website I'd like to

00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:35,550
play a brief video by a friend and rank

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,139
hi everyone I'm in New York right now

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,150
and wish I could be there to enjoy the

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,210
conference but I want to share with you

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,039
some exciting updates deep lines of AI

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,930
started a partnership with the

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,330
tensorflow team with the goal of making

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,060
world-class education available for

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,110
developers on the Coursera platform

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,330
since releasing the deep learning

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,009
specialization I've seen so many of you

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,599
hundreds of thousands learned the

00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,550
fundamental skills of deep learning

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,349
I'm delighted we've been able to

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,509
complement that with the tens of throw

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:05,580
in practice specialization to help

00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:07,680
developers learn how to build MMO

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,949
applications for computer vision and LP

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,629
sequence models and more today I want to

00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:14,940
share of you an exciting new project

00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,210
that the deep learning intensive flow

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,889
teams have been working on together

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,599
being able to use your models in the

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,240
real world scenario is when machine

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,979
learning gets physically exciting so

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,560
we're producing a new fork or

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,539
specialization called tensor flow data

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,129
and deployment that will actually take

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,650
your ML skills to the real world

00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,599
deploy models to the web mobile devices

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,449
and more it will be available on

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,830
Coursera in early December I'm excited

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,240
to see what you do with these new

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,240
resources keep learning

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,360
all right this is really cool we you

00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,929
know since we started working on these

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,300
programs it's been pretty amazing to see

00:07:53,929 --> 00:08:00,860
hundreds of thousands of people take

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,020
those courses and the goal of these

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,860
educational resources is to let everyone

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,029
participate in the ML revolution

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,809
regardless of what your experience with

00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,809
machine learning is

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:21,560
so great way to get involved is to

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:24,140
connect with your GE we now have 126

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,270
machine learning GT e--'s globally we

00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,090
love our G DS they're amazing they do

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:33,130
amazing things for the community this

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:37,040
year alone they gave over 400 tech talks

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,770
250 workshops they wrote 221 articles

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,940
reaching tens of thousands of developers

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,580
and one thing that was new this year is

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,200
that they helped with doc sprints so

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,180
Doc's are really important they're

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,940
critical right you really need good

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,780
quality Doc's to work on machine

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,460
learning and often the documentation is

00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,970
not available in people's native

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,830
languages and so this is why we went

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,100
partially with our DS we launched the

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,170
doc Sprint's over 9,000 API Doc's were

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,560
updated by members of the tensorflow

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,810
community in over 15 countries we heard

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,270
amazing stories of you know the power

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,370
power outage and power running out and

people you know coming back later to

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,480

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,090
writing Doc's on their phones so if

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,610
you've been helping with Doc's and thank

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,410
you if you're in the room of over

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,410
livestream thank you so much

if you're interested in helping

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,180
translate documentation in your native

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,600
language please reach out and we'll help

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,980
you organize a Doc's brain

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,510
another thing that the GD is help with

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,940
is experimenting with the latest

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,300
features so I want to call out samvit

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,970
even an MLG de from Singapore who's

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,070
already experimenting with 2 point X and

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,760
GPUs and you can hear him talk later

00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,440
today to hear about his experience so if

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,730
you want to get involved please reach

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:08,350
out through gde and and start working on

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:12,380
sense flow another really great way to

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,350
help is to join sa a sig is a special

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,060
interest group and it helps you work on

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,450
the things that you're the most excited

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,160
about on tensorflow we have now 11 6

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,680
available

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,290
addons yo and networking in particular

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,070
really supported the transition to 2.0

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,160
by embracing the parts of contributing

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,430
them into 2.0 and sig build ensures that

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,920
TF runs well everywhere on any us any

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,890
architecture and plays well with the

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,990
Python with the Python library and we

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,660
have many other really exciting SIG's so

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,300
I really encourage you to join one

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,790
you

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,790
another really great way to contribute

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,370
is through competition and for those of

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,980
you who were there the dev summit back

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,850
in March we launched our 2.0 challenge

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:07,250
on Def Post and the grand prize was an

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,520
invitation to this event since the flow

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:13,520
world and so we would like to honor our

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,060
2.0 challenge winners and I think we are

00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:22,270
lucky to have two of them in the room of

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,270
Victor and Kyle if you're here

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,830
so Victor worked on handtruck ideas a

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,950
library for prototyping hand gesture in

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:40,730
the browser and then a Kyle worked on a

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:44,270
Python 3 package to assimilate n body to

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:47,240
generate n body simulations so one thing

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:50,720
we heard too during our travels is oh

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,980
that that that hackathon was great but I

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,610
totally missed it can we have another

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,990
one

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,630
well yes let's do another one so if you

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:03,590
go on tier 4 despots calm we're

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:06,650
launching a new challenge you can apply

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,870
your 2.0 skills and share the latest and

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,120
greatest and win cool prizes and so

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:15,020
really excited to see what you're going

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,700
to build another great community that

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,420
we're very excited to partner with is

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,760
Kaggle so we're alone we've launched the

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,010
context on cargo to challenge you with a

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,770
question answering model based on

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,080
Wikipedia article you can put your

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:35,240
natural language processing skills to

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,730
the test and earn $50,000 in prizes it's

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,640
open for entry until January 20 seconds

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:45,260
so best of luck so we have a few action

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,440
items for you and they're listed on the

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:52,190
slide but remember we created tents of

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,730
the world for you to help you connect

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:59,030
and share what you've been working on so

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,160
our main action item for you in the next

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,130
