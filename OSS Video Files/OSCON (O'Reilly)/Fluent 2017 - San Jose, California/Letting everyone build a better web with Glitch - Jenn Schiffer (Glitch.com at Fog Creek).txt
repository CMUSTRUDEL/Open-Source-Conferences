Description: 
	At a time when it's more critical than ever to support and nurture underrepresented coders and help current coders thrive, what does it look like to create a community where everyone can make the app of their dreams? Jenn Schiffer offers an overview of Glitch, a brand-new creative community that enables coders to collaborate in ways that past generations of programmers could only dream of.

the problem with fake ideas is that they

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,570
create barriers of entry to the web

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,880
development industry which is a huge

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,430
problem because with those barriers come

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,349
a lack of diversity inclusivity which

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,460
then leads to a lack of products that

00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,650
work for everyone

00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,210
that's why I like VR makes most women

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,859
sick and voice recognition doesn't

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,249
really work for women are people of

00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:27,470
accents it also leads to a lack of

00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:30,169
products that are created to solve

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,899
actual problems like that we have like

00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:36,079
we don't need a ride-sharing bus we have

00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,760
buses so all these fake ideas turn our

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,890
focus away from things that we should be

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,929
created to help society and really just

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,170
to better ourselves as individuals or

00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:47,629
people in power which is not chill and I

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,879
feel like we can fix this by having a

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:54,289
real conversation about real ideas like

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,499
building for the web is actually kind of

00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,690
hard it's okay to admit that we don't

00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,280
learn alone you can say you're

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,960
self-taught but really you're guiding

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,420
you're teaching you don't just learn

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,370
from out of thin air how to build for

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,400
the web you need support whether it's in

00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:13,310
the form of books courses or people

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,020
helping you it's okay to ask for help so

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,240
by saying that we're self-taught and and

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,280
boasting that just makes other people

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,490
who need that extra support feel like

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,100
they don't belong when they do our tools

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,480
are far from perfect which is why we

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,590
feel like building for the web is

00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,530
getting harder and it is getting harder

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:36,560
but also we are human it's okay to get

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,330
frustrated when we hit a problem whether

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,710
it's a problem from something we don't

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,450
know or it's something that's

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,760
constraining us because the way that

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,320
technology works today again building

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,850
for the web is very hard we have a lot

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,770
of constraints that stop us from doing

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,450
all the things that we want to do and

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,070
when you hit that wall it's really

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,780
technically challenging and it's

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,510
emotionally challenging that's what I

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,110
love about the industry but sometimes I

00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,510
have to showed a few tears along the way

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,250
so glitch comm is a new product where

00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,530
we're taking a unique approach at

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,690
building something where we can enforce

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,820
those real ideas and really make

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,950
building for web something that everyone

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,760
can do and can continue doing because

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,900
inclusivity

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,709
all those

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,989
importance so that's by sort of shifting

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:23,269
our focus from what we individually need

00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:26,620
as engineers and looking to the bigger

00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:30,079
picture of what is best for all of us

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:34,400
and that's by focusing on both the tools

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:37,480
but most importantly the community the

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,400
tools are easy it's just software right

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,470
but any level of developer whether they

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,049
are thinking of maybe learning to code

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,389
or they're experienced or experts and

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:49,129
want to continue to learn the first

00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:53,209
thing they want to do is actually build

00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:56,389
something with glitch we've built an

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:59,359
editor that allows you to build code

00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:02,359
write code on the web whether it's

00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:05,329
static or full page full stack web apps

00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:07,069
and it's really cute it kind of looks

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,239
like a toy sometimes so that's fine

00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,769
because if you're going to be in front

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,510
of a computer all day you want to like

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,359
have a pleasant aesthetic experience

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:17,359
with what you're building with and we

00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:19,760
don't learn alone so our editor allows

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,819
multiple users at once to collaborate so

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,419
you can pair I'm really good at signing

00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:30,169
free stock images so this is the team as

00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:34,280
is caption so we all want to work on a

00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:35,900
cool team preferably of fuzzy dogs and a

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,169
lot of software that's being built today

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,340
allows us to work as teams via the

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:44,989
products last means putting out code pen

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,129
Jaspan all these other tools that allow

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,419
you to work together and I think it's

00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,090
really important that we continue doing

00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:52,159
that because we want to learn with other

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,540
people be it our co-workers or just

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,720
random on the internet that want to help

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,720
