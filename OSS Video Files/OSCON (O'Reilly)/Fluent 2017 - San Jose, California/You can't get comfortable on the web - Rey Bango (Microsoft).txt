Title: You can't get comfortable on the web - Rey Bango (Microsoft)
Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: Fluent 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	It used to be that as a web developer, you could hang your hat on a technology and feel confident that it would be updated at a manageable pace. That's no longer the case. The web is evolving, and tools are evolving in tandem to meet the needs of modern developers and applications. Rey Bango explains why now is the time to embrace being uncomfortable and consider how you'll evolve as well.

Thomas Fuchs is one of the best

00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,810
JavaScript developers in the world in my

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,360
opinion

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,880
he wrote script oculus which was a an

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,019
animation framework for prototype many

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,599
years ago and then eventually wrote

00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,940
depth ojs but his his javascript skills

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,609
are top-notch and if you look at it it

00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,789
was true in 1997 hey you wanted to

00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,960
create a website you had HTML and spark

00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:28,720
the BI and guess what you build a

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,199
website a beautiful and in 2007 no

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,070
problem

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,990
you want to do a little bit more

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,809
functionality add jQuery into the mix

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:39,100
well done 17 seems a little bit

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:41,110
different yeah so you want to start up a

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,750
library there you go I mean our frame

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,570
website you got it then you factor in

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,030
something like node and NPM NPM alone

00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,430
which has something like half a million

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,690
packages and you start to what you start

00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,610
to bless you you start to understand why

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,070
developers are frustrated why developers

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,400
are concerned you understand their

00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,799
discontent with how things are evolving

00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,710
because it's a radical change to have to

00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,890
go from a very simplistic process to

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:15,340
scaffold up a website to now bundle in

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,899
all these things and learning the api's

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,969
that go with all these different

00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:21,579
frameworks and tools to make things

00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:23,409
happen you couple that with the learning

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:24,700
curve that we all have when we're

00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,170
learning something if you really think

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,880
about it when we learn a new library we

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,469
have this great up ramp time where we're

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,630
feeling like man we are the kings of the

00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:33,700
world and in all sudden you start boom

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,079
you go down because you realize oh crap

00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,320
this is much more complicated than I

00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,969
thought and it takes time anywhere from

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
weeks to months to become really

00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,320
proficient on a tool and if you multiply

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,299
that times five or ten different tools

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,210
you can understand why people are

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,670
getting concerned totally makes sense

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,509
but it's not a bad thing remember we are

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,679
trying to build feature-rich

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,869
applications we are trying to leverage

00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,759
the web platform to build these great

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,299
experiences and in order for us to do

00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,609
that we have to evolve we have to

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:09,250
innovate there's nothing wrong with more

00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:12,610
tools that those tools actually solve a

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,230
real-world problem and that's what we're

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,910
all trying to do everybody in this

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,100
audience is here to solve real world

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,750
problems and we want to take it to the

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,420
next level whether it's app like

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,150
experiences or connecting to a

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,000
third-party third-party service all

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,830
these things are meant to make the user

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,130
experience for your sites that much

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,130
