Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: Fluent 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Is it better or easier to work on the web today, 20+ years after its creation? What lessons have we learnedâ€”and what are we still doing wrong? Max Firtman explains why, after years of adding layers of complexity to the frontend, especially in relation to layout, compatibility, and performance issues, it makes sense to go back to the roots of the web.

but frustrations are not just for the

00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,309
user we as developers or designers of

00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,309
producers of the web we have been

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:15,670
dealing with frustration a lot

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:19,270
starting with tools and techniques so

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,970
for example at the beginning okay I was

00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,590
designing websites using frame sets you

00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,149
even know what it that is right I'm not

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,239
talking about iframes frame sets and

00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:30,399
after that after why like two years that

00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,860
was on the way to design websites okay

00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,440
we need to use tables okay to layout

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,859
everything and then of course tables is

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,989
all the way in the meantime we have

00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,899
flexible salt version and new versions

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:46,719
we have semantic containers and then now

00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,370
we have table a yahoo in CSS again yeah

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,980
I know it's something different okay

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,170
but anyways it's interesting to see ok

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,899
how things are changing over the years

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:59,079
and then we have us other speakers

00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,640
mentioned today ok some issues like for

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,339
example prototype and it's cryptic loose

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,950
then it was replaced by jQuery and then

00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:07,210
we have jQuery Mobile okay but take away

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,820
mobile it wasn't really the mobile

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,970
version of jQuery okay by the way that

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,979
was another book I offer for Riley and

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,960
now we will open a parenthesis I really

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,560
like the Korean version of that book

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,930
okay

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,579
isn't that they're really cool O'Reilly

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:27,310
cover ok closing parenthesis so now we

00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:28,840
have angular ok so you have to spend a

00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,329
lot of time learning angularjs for

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,880
example and you know ok even if you

00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,950
became a senior there but now we sang we

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,409
are not angularjs and you need to

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,320
probably learn again some things and of

00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,899
course we have the react universe with

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,670
different versions there and that means

00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,859
that everything is changing all the time

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,350
it's not about the tools and techniques

00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:53,799
it's also about browsers are changing

00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,570
devices are changing also techniques are

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,420
changing remember that thing okay you

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,539
see prefixes or compatibility is

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:06,429
changing all the time and that basically

00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:09,039
ends with this guy ok Socrates that said

00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:11,620
this thing ok that's Latin

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,330
I don't know that in any way but that

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,780
means basically I only know that I know

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,760
nothing I think that's the feeling that

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,370
we have been having for a while here in

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
the web field right that you will learn

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,770
something and then you know nothing

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,080
you'll learn something that you know

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,480
nothing so it's like a current feeling

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,400
that we have in the web space and again

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm not the only one saying this today

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,030
