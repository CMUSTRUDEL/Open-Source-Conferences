Playlist: Fluent 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	While most conversations around DevOps revolve around tool X or tool Y or the automation of X and Y, the reality is that DevOps requires high-performing people and teams.

	00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,339
alright so we just heard about a bunch

00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,930
of tools there's selenium testing

00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,640
there's tracing there's application

00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,110
monitoring there's no sequel databases

00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,510
they're all in that room back there

00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,280
there'll be plenty of time to talk about

00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,320
tools and even though I'm with the tools

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,500
vendor I'm not going to talk about tools

00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,050
I'm going to talk about people being on

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,400
a dysfunctional team is no fun and it

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,039
will be it into your personal life and

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,420
it will bleed into your products and so

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,789
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,220
take you through something that we do at

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,690
Atlassian we've open sourced these we're

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,670
going to take you through how we help

00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,840
build our teams and our people so that

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,059
they can do the best work of their lives

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,000
but that's our goal with the teams we

00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,910
manage so my name is Sean I started my

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,219
career in IT and I ticked off dr. Dre he

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,840
sued me as did Metallica I had too many

00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,579
files that was a traumatic experience

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,090
but that was part of my time as a

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,820
sysadmin I then moved into

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,730
infrastructure roles worked on VR teams

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,350
Security Response Teams and I've now

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,719
moved on to the dev side with Atlassian

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,790
so I've been able to be a part of teams

00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,320
on all sides of this and one experience

00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,470
that stuck out for me when I'm not

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,290
working I'd prefer to be skiing in Tahoe

00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,610
on a vacation and it was with the

00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,830
previous company but I was in the middle

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,770
of a very long incident I was over a

00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,320
48-hour incident everybody was in the

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,360
hot rooms doing the chat offs for 48

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,130
hours plus and then it stopped and it

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,650
snowed and it was beautiful and I wanted

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,259
to go skiing but it started again and I

00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,180
got so frustrated that I landed a

00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,000
backflip for the first time in my life

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,740
that's dangerous don't do that but it

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,540
was this moment of release for me

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,400
because I was so frustrated with the way

00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,470
the incident was going and I thought

00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,770
there has to be a better way to help the

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,820
people in this DevOps transformation

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,740
handle their jobs better because they're

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,780
stressful people rely on the things we

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,729
build and so that's part of what

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,350
underpins our entire company's product

00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,049
strategy but also how we think about

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,680
DevOps practices start with culture and

00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,759
collaboration build on the tools and

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,829
from there you can do some really great

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,420
things and so today we're going to run

00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:10,419
probably the largest team health monitor

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,010
we've ever done I don't know to 3,000

00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,140
people it's called our DevOps health

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,520
monitor and what we're going to do is we

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,370
open sources you can get them on our

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,069
website if you google Atlassian DevOps

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,480
playbook you'll find these and I'm going

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,340
to bring out the bitbucket product team

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,959
here and they're going to be our happy

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,450
volunteers but I'd love all of you to

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,620
volunteer use your thumbs that's it not

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,290
going to ask for anything more difficult

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,730
no cheesy applause do it in your head do

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,730
it in real life you're going to do

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,260
thumbs up neutral or thumbs down for

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,780
your own team you don't have to tell us

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,060
to do it share it so I have the big

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,890
bucket team here let's bring them out so

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,390
let's start here Angie tell us about

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,489
what you do hi everyone my name is

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,400
Angela and I'm on the budget development

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:54,560
team my name is Logan and I'm on the big

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,080
bucket operations team my name is Jim

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm Alon D bitbucket support team

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,350
alright and this is something we

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,090
actually do quite regularly internally

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,380
at Atlassian and it's something that i

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,970
hope you can take home from this event

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,010
right well I'll take home a USB cord

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,019
well I'll take um some stickers and some

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,730
koozies but if your boss asks you what

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,110
did you get out of fluent you can run a

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,380
team health monitor and in the next

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,030
SEC's six minutes you'll be a pro so

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,739
first of all we've published a bunch of

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,180
these plays if you're on the site a

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,709
service team health monitor or the

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,700
DevOps team health monitor will get you

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:27,470
started and it looks like this each one

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,120
of these categories will run through

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,829
with the thumbs up thumbs down and then

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,750
we repeat this on the cycle that makes

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,489
sense for our team it could be at the

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,060
end of every sprint it could be at the

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,980
end of the month

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,360
or the quarter but it's how we assess

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,070
how the team is doing so we're going to

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,390
run through it pretty quick we're going

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,250
to use some fake examples with the

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,420
bitbucket team but hey team you just

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,060
shipped a massive new feature

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,110
it's called semantic search for code

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,790
search for bitbucket

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,040
and it sort of does four code search

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,660
what Google did for web search makes a

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,549
big difference a lot of stress on the

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,769
team building and shipping this feature

00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,720
so how did we do on team leadership that

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:03,920
bucket team thumbs up thumbs down or

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,170
neutral okay we got a yellow in the

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,970
middle we might come back to that how

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,650
did we do in terms of a balanced team

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,829
did we have the right skills in the

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,120
right roles where we gapping anymore did

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:15,140
we force someone to take on a role that

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,570
maybe they didn't have the right

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,900
training for give us give us the measure

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,100
team three two one go all right so for

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,950
the most part we were pretty strong

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,900
there on the next category service

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,550
mandate did we understand the service we

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,880
were providing and the expectations of

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,740
that

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,960
service when we ship this product and

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,520
released it big bucket team okay it's a

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,560
neutral across the board we might come

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,840
back to it service levels did we

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,460
understand the expectations did we

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,830
communicate those to the other

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,150
organizations internally about what we

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:52,430
were shipping and what the customer

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,320
expectations would be go oh a red we're

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,180
going to dig into this one you you want

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,290
to find a red because that's where you

00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,750
can make improvements there's a red

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,280
somewhere in all of your team's customer

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,720
centricity did we understand what the

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,640
customer wanted we have information

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,070
about customer needs about customer

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,780
requests about customer feedback did the

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,220
team did you feel like you had a clear

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,160
enough picture of the customer needs in

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,400
this situation good

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,990
all right tools and process did we give

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,940
you the right tools did we offer

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,950
operationalize the usage of those tools

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,390
in the right way do you have access to

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:29,120
them could you communicate effectively

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:31,010
how did we do another read so I'm going

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,900
to skip through the last two and we're

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,220
going to go into mitigation here so

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,660
we've completed our first team health

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,520
monitor usually we'll spend about an

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,350
hour on these and in each section we'll

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,140
talk in more detail about what worked

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,420
and what didn't in this case I want to

00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,670
start with service levels and tools and

00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,080
process we'll ask the team for some more

00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,150
information about what worked and what

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,000
didn't so I noticed service levels was

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,390
red bitbucket team what what happened

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,950
there why did you give it a read if

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,740
you're going to ship a feature you need

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,090
to tell support ahead of time we were

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,560
not prepared for the volume of tickets

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,240
we received we weren't prepared for some

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,800
the questions we've gotten and that's

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,960
really slowed everything down we can't

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,440
get people taken care of as quickly as

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,210
we can

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,200
yeah this never happens right someone

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,990
shipped a feature and didn't tell

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,450
support of course we're just doing this

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,860
for the play here right so you didn't

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,120
know the feature was coming you didn't

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,230
have time to prep your team and now

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,550
they're on the phone with customers and

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,290
not able to give answers basically

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,760
basically we have to wait for developers

00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,050
to come online to ask them questions

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,940
that we should have been able to answer

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,470
upfront that feels like a breakdown in

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,850
process we're going to diagnose that a

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,320
little bit more how about on the ops

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,730
side what what happened with this

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,380
release that caused you to give us a

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,060
read I think Logan you gave us a read I

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,240
think it's around service levels yeah I

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,210
felt that the ops team in general didn't

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,740
have enough input in

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,120
the development of the products and as a

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,009
result the product doesn't scale well

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,020
it's not as performance we like to see

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,509
in general is kind of giving us

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,919
headaches in performance where's the

00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,240
problem what's what's happening here is

00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,860
it that we rolled it out to too many

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,750
people at once the performance issues

00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,699
well we used our monitoring and

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,099
analytics to drill down and we noticed

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,880
that it has a bottleneck on the database

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:07,919
particularly got it so Angela on the dev

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,830
team I know our CEO promised this

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,380
feature we wanted to get it out why did

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,000
you give us a read on tools and process

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,650
and service levels I think what's going

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,150
on in your world yeah so we've been

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,090
getting a lot of pressure to get coach

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,130
Cosette shift we've been working day and

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,539
night on this but the code is just kind

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,900
of sitting with ups and we don't really

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:29,970
know why we've all dealt with that in

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,470
some part of our lives so we have

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,300
stressed-out developers trying to code

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,310
really fast we have operations teams

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,870
that take the brunt of a failure when it

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,729
goes out in front of customers and we

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,009
have a support team that wants to be

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,139
better when it comes to the customers

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,400
they're talking to left unsolved these

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,990
problems are what caused your employees

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,150
to go work somewhere else

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,699
but if we can do this at the end of the

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,169
Sprint and check it next next week or

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,750
next month and check in with the team

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,729
I'm going to put some steps in place to

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,800
improve have we improved we run the

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,830
measures have we improved again we run

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,969
the measures except something's read now

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,639
I've been able to discover through this

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:07,949
process that something is getting worse

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,840
within the team on effective

00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,490
partnerships maybe we have a large agile

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,659
organization with cross-functional teams

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,280
that depend on each other

00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,870
we need to diagnose that and make it

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,280
better and so the health monitor gives

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,370
you a view of how your team is

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,289
performing over a period of time and

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,659
then the playbooks will actually give

00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,310
you ways to address that diagnosis and

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,650
get the team healthy there are over 20

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,539
different plays that you can run and on

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,099
the sidebar here you can see pick the

00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,380
type of team or project that you're

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,240
working on and then pick the pain points

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,890
that were identified and this will take

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,079
you through a process to help your team

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,839
improve you can see there's a large

00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:44,459
number of plays here in this case for

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,020
the DevOps health monitor we're going to

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,180
recommend the dasie decision-making

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,760
framework this is about bringing in the

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,920
right person at the right time to make

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,740
the right decision so Logan you may have

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,460
had concerns about database performance

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,870
Angela you had concerns

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,390
about shipping by the date that you

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,620
wanted to ship it perhaps someone needs

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,020
to make that decision and we need to

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,760
know who that decision-maker is JC will

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,660
help you do that

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,280
pre-mortem is something we do that's a

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,560
lot of fun it helps us figure out what's

00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,600
going to go wrong before we release

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,430
something so essentially a good

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,110
collaboration on what could go wrong and

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,940
lastly roles and responsibilities

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,070
somebody had the job to make sure

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,080
support was aware except they didn't and

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,550
we missed it and that will help us

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,700
identify that problem and make it better

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,320
so a couple of things there's a party

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,670
tonight we like to work hard play hard

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,650
at six-thirty

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,180
DevOps after dark we have a session

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,970
tomorrow with our head of infrastructure

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,910
at 9:50 and lastly you can get these

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,590
play books as PDFs you can get them as

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,510
confluence templates and you can bring

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,760
them back to your team and execute them

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,280
tomorrow you have the 10 minute overview

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,240
spend an hour spend 30 minutes but you

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,220
might be surprised about the

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,420
improvements you can make thank you

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,420
