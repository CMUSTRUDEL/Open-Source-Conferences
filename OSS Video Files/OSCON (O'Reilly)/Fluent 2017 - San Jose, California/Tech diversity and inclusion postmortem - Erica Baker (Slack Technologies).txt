	00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:08,160
in 2013

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,230
Tracy Chiu decided that she was going to

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,150
ask where are the women

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,980
and she made a medium post that asked

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,360
just that and then she started tracking

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,790
that and that's how we got our first

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,340
detection of what was going on in the

00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,040
tech industry and shortly after she did

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,160
that tech company started releasing

00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,430
diversity ports that came in 2014 and we

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,829
started to see that we had some really

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,600
poor outcomes in the industry

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,269
there was no representation well a

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,059
little like across the board you saw 2%

00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:45,620
3% representation of black people 1 to

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,870
2% representation of Latin X people

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,600
roughly 20 to 30 percent representation

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,960
of women and like that doesn't reflect

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,109
the world we live in at all and so

00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,920
pretty indicative of a problem so what

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,640
went wrong in our work on diversity

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,380
inclusion we have failed to define what

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,270
a good outcome looks like we have been

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,550
doing so much work working working

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,530
working but nobody said this is what

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,110
we're working toward this is what a good

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,930
outcome looks like right we have not

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,850
created any methods of accountability we

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,270
don't say or very few companies have

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,830
those where they say oh well if you

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,900
don't meet this diversity goal this

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,190
thing will happen that just doesn't

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,950
happen there's no accountability for

00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,110
what we're trying to do we're not

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,330
measuring and reporting on indicators of

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,880
inclusion like retentions like

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,360
promotions like Pay Equity we're just

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,160
reporting on diversity who is in the

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,610
building but not saying how they're

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,730
doing when they get there and we're not

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,680
monitoring across all intersections we

00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,840
are only right now except for I think

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,460
recently a slack where I used to work

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,090
release their diversity port which

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,680
included people with disabilities mostly

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,960
we're just tracking gender and race and

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,360
there are very many other sexier

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,019
intersections that we should be tracking

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,750
along we have too much reliance on

00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:18,320
unconscious bias

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,970
as a cure-all every time this discussion

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,710
comes up people say oh we have

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,790
unconscious bias training we're done

00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:29,060
goody and that's just the unconscious

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:34,060
bias training I say is probably the

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,060
pre-k of diversity inclusion training

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,620
companies have not responded well to

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,420
reports of harassment right we see what

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,070
happened recently susan fowler when

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,770
she's you know wrote her thing about

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,450
uber she said yeah I told everybody I

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,040
was supposed to tell at uber I did

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,520
everything I was supposed to do and

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,610
still nothing happened and so people

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,140
have to basically publicize what's going

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,760
on instead of companies showing up and

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,760
