Description: 
	As developers and web professionals we've built a community like no other. We have our own culture, our own jokes and stories, and our own ideas. The story of our community's growth is the story of the internetâ€”and the story of a big piece of our modern world. Aria Stewart talks about the role of community in our profession, what that really means, and some of the things that implies.
