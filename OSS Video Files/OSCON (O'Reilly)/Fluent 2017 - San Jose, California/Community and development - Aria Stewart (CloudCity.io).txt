Title: Community and development - Aria Stewart (CloudCity.io)
Publication date: 2017-06-27
Playlist: Fluent 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	As developers and web professionals we've built a community like no other. We have our own culture, our own jokes and stories, and our own ideas. The story of our community's growth is the story of the internetâ€”and the story of a big piece of our modern world. Aria Stewart talks about the role of community in our profession, what that really means, and some of the things that implies.

	00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,010
when we talk about online communities

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,210
now a lot of us think of Facebook and

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,420
this is where I get to tell you a bit of

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,890
a bummer story everybody has to have one

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,260
of those in their talk right the low

00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,840
point so we can get to the climax at the

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,050
end I didn't go to school as a teenager

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,679
I'm what they call unschooled

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:27,329
self-educated mostly self-taught and so

00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,069
I had a bit of an odd upbringing but

00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,229
part of my upbringing was that I went to

00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:35,310
a summer camp every year for unschooled

00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:36,540
teenagers we it's about as close as I

00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,340
have to a high school graduating class

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,570
those people are some of my closest

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,260
friends and we're still on still in

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,380
touch today we started this really

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,500
amazing online community back in 1996

00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,780
wiki's were becoming popular and we set

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,230
a wiki up we customized the heck out of

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,750
it we knew borders and CSS when it came

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,980
out and animations the kinds of things

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,800
you would expect teenagers to do with

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,210
new technology and it had his own set of

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,250
in jokes and it had some really

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,810
heartfelt late-night communication and

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,829
conversations between teenagers who are

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,560
just getting to know themselves in the

00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,939
world some of the most intimate

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,829
conversations I've ever had where I

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,119
write they're out in the open on on a

00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,819
wiki they didn't even have a login

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,859
system not all of us are even that tech

00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:23,399
savvy those of us were taught who were

00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,929
tech savvy savvy did not even dominate

00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:29,069
the group but those of us who were tech

00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:31,679
savvy taught the others and then came

00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:34,380
the spammers pages would get overwritten

00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:35,670
by random messages about Viagra spammers

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,159
have no connection at all to community

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,959
that's the reason it has persisted so

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,319
long they permeate what would otherwise

00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,700
be empty space with an elaborate izing

00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,560
they really do just fill the empty space

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,600
so we locked it down a bit we carry on

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,689
for a couple of years and then comes

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,969
facebook it's this really kind of a neat

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,729
site I'm not sure if you've heard of it

00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:59,039
so you can upload pictures and I have

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,569
these kind of forums they're a little

00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,649
bit different and they started letting

00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,779
people who are into colleges use it

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,799
finally well anyway you know what

00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:07,709
communities are going to do they're

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,599
going to adopt a new technology so for

00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,370
awhile the wiki community is fine things

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,720
slowed down a little bit new folks don't

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,640
find it quite as easily as they used to

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,050
and then they get there they don't

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,710
actually understand it the way that they

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,210
used to

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,480
they don't engage with the technology

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,160
because they have some new expectations

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,530
the creativity slows down and it

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,420
eventually stops people post a Facebook

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,830
but it gets redesigned a bunch of times

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,110
and it's never quite right and it never

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,520
quite suits our community and it's

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,110
definitely not as intimate nobody can go

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,330
translate the user interface into one of

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,740
the other campers made-up languages you

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,410
can't do you can't take over the

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,330
platform I wish I could say that the

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,130
bomber stops their Facebook absorbing

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,790
the community and all in it but it

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,290
doesn't so over the years we grow up we

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,090
go our own ways some of my friends are

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,320
real back-to-the-land types and don't

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,020
get on the internet very much and the

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,480
community I know and love faded away or

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,340
does it it turns out that Facebook had

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,620
started optimizing for locality and for

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,210
attention and at this point I lived in

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,890
Colorado and most of my own schooler

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,300
friends lived on the west coast my

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,980
social graph has this gigantic split

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,750
down the middle on one side I have the

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,950
Townies from the town around me and on

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,710
the other side I have these unschoolers

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,380
at a distance up up and down the west

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,750
coast and since there's not much overlap

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,040
and because I live in Colorado Facebook

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,810
decides that those are the people I want

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,540
to see and it shows me only the post

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,670
from the Townies it turns out that I had

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,320
missed out on hundreds of connections

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,840
with friends from man schooler community

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,970
the community was still there births and

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,920
deaths weddings divorces comings out and

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,480
transitions all of those things were

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,650
there and I had just been missing out

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,870
because Facebook had decided that I

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,460
didn't need to see those posts the

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,290
people that Facebook saw is more close

00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,030
connected with each other we're still

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,710
happily sharing with each other they saw

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,450
they attended each other's weddings they

00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,970
attended and they should share pictures

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,620
with each other Facebook just stopped

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,940
showing me any of those and I wonder how

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,710
many other people have been alienated

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,040
from community by a technological

00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,040
decision

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,200
