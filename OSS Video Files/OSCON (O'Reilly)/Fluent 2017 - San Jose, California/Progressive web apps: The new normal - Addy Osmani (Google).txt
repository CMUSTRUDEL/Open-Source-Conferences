now some folks might be wondering well

00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,089
our progressive web apps just like a

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,719
chrome only thing are they a google only

00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:13,730
thing and the answer is absolutely not

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,139
progressive web apps work on you know

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,610
they're increasingly working well in

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,210
Firefox and edge

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:22,460
opera Samsung internet browser this the

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,840
API that I mentioned enabling some of

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,570
these experiences are getting better and

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,430
better support and even if a browser

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,950
that you care about isn't on this list

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,570
just yet progressive web apps give

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,710
better experiences to folks even if

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,960
their platform of choice doesn't

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,969
necessarily support all of the features

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,379
that's what the progressive part in

00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:42,339
there is about it's about progressive

00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:45,469
enhancement to give you one example

00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:47,690
let's take Lancome there are luxury

00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,460
cosmetics brands they built an engaging

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,589
immersive progressive web app that works

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,170
really great on all browsers and they've

00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:56,899
seen some solid results but there was a

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,199
slight difference here most of their

00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:03,139
mobile users over 65% are on iPhones

00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:06,590
they're on higher-end phones and as we

00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:08,630
know you know Safari on iPhones doesn't

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,920
necessarily support all the exact set of

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,860
features that a progressive web app

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,800
might need like service workers just yet

00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,350
however well Lancome discovered was the

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,180
session length for iOS users actually

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,160
increased after shipping their

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,960
progressive web app some of the same

00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,030
concepts around trying to ship something

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,430
that enables a better user experience

00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,830
that's granularly served down it's fast

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,870
it's reliable benefit people even if

00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,150
they don't necessarily support all the

00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,220
same reengagement features or the same

00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,340
benefits for repeat visits with respect

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,750
to caching so even if you care about a

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,640
slightly different browser support

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,270
matrix progressive web apps can still be

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,270
a win for you

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,340
