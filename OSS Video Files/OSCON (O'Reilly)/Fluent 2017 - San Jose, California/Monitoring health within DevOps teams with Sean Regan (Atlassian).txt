hi this is Mike Hendrickson from fluent

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,790
in velocity in San Jose I'm here with

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,569
Sean Sean how you doing awesome Mike how

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,570
are you good

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,790
so you with that last hand that's it and

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,099
what are you guys up to today so we just

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,289
had a lot of fun we we had a keynote on

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,119
the main stage and stuff talking about

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,560
tools and speeds and feeds and

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,240
automation and all the things they

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,470
should have in the vendor pavilion we

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,449
tried to throw a curveball at everybody

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,869
and not talk about tools even though

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,670
we're a tools vendor and my goal was to

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,870
get 3,000 people to give a thumbs-up

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,610
thumbs-down or neutral kind of together

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,170
and that's part of this thing musical

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,940
films not a Twitter's achill yeah not a

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,140
Twitter that would be great for some

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,379
sort of marketing metric I guess yeah

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,829
but no a physical thumbs up and it's

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,360
this idea of a team health monitor we

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,489
focus so much on sort of the technology

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,370
that we forget sometimes with people and

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,559
this whole DevOps building and shipping

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,840
softer software faster thing kind of

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,129
Grimes people up sometimes if you've

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,170
ever been in an incident or night you

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,300
might have a million people on Twitter

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,500
ping you going when is this thing going

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,810
to be on what is this thing gonna be on

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,510
meanwhile and your kids soccer games

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,860
going on or something right so this

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,990
health monitor is sort of about making

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,040
sure that your team is healthy because

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,860
if they aren't they're going to go do

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,630
something else so a tools vendor I mean

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,610
I kind of think you guys as a tools

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,729
company yeah we're known for the demo

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,740
measure is that another tool it's a it's

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,810
a process I guess I'd call it so it's

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,280
you can download it as a PDF you could

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,700
get it as a confluence template or you

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,960
can just print it out at Kinkos in a 36

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,329
inch piece of paper stick it on the wall

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,909
and run it with a marker and some

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,009
post-it notes and so we we grew from

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,170
about a thousand employees to 2,000 in

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,119
the last 12 months and one of the ways

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,350
we're able to do that I think is to make

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,840
sure we're really really tight on

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,009
developing the people we kind of always

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,560
say we want the people to do the best

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,909
work of their lives and that doesn't

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,740
always mean giving them the next tool

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,060
sometimes it means actually equipping

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,009
them to maybe manage a team for the

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,610
first time so this health monitor

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,930
basically allows you to use your thumb

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,250
very quickly and say you know how are we

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,119
doing on team leadership and the team

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,420
and so it's this this

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,580
good man yeah bad I call that Montessori

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,530
right yeah I play golf like that exactly

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,150
so once you do that right you have a

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,590
list you have essentially red green and

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,420
yellows and when you have those you know

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,519
where to diagnose and then we have a

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,690
series of plays that you can run that

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,580
may help let's say it's a leadership

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,610
deficiency or a lack of shared

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,870
understanding or unclear decision-making

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,910
which happens all the time especially

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,030
when you have these two pizza teams kind

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,110
of software highly agile teams knowing

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,360
who's the right person to make the

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,890
decision so our play books basically

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,810
diagnosed with a thumb and then we give

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,120
you a play and you can run that play

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,230
with your team to see if you can improve

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,150
it and then you run the health monitor

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,650
again maybe at the end of the Sprint so

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,590
this is something you guys use for

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,750
yourself and you're now giving back to

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,489
other people who want to use it yeah I

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,590
mean it's it's it's part of our culture

00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:00,799
and when we talk to our customers

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,180
especially with this microservices agile

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,190
devops transformation that everyone is

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,890
going through you now have more small

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:10,370
autonomous teams with dependencies and

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,530
so it takes some organizational talent

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,910
in companies to start to make sure

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,310
everyone knows how to work with such a

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,690
kind of an agile environment and so our

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,760
play books help companies make that

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,380
transition maybe from waterfall where

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,079
it's you know one team one date one

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,609
project to a lot of independent teams

00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,760
working quickly and do a lot of the

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:31,970
tools that you guys deliver also work

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,660
with this mindset yeah I mean it's like

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,430
it's a mindset

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,019
yeah there's certainly a mindset so

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,620
right we're known pretty well for the

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:42,049
JIRA tools or confluence or bitbucket

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,540
but we also have tools like HipChat you

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,430
have Trello and so I think that kind of

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,380
leads us to maybe a little bit of where

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,660
the future of this DevOps thing goes I

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,280
think it's a convenient word right we we

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,930
took the speed limiter off of this whole

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,370
industry when you didn't have to wait

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,470
for a server to show up at the loading

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,319
dock and so that put all the pressure on

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,609
the people that work together now and I

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,220
think that pressure is making its way

00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:07,609
all the way through the business in a

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,950
way that it hasn't before think about if

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:11,000
you used to make a physical product

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,579
right at your company

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,840
there were assembly lines capital

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,329
expenses

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,700
Machinery molds that you would have to

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,950
build we made physical breasts yeah look

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,510
you have a great example yes and if we

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,600
move to the digital world that everybody

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,910
is moving through that book does not

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,889
depend on a dead tree you do not have to

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,260
wait for the logger to bring the tree to

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:36,020
the mill to print the book and so

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,419
because we've essentially vaporized that

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,400
lead time the pressure is on people to

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,660
collaborate faster and Devon ops were

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,970
forced to figure it out

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,950
it started in software this sort of dark

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,479
art of technical teams is actually going

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,520
mainstream I don't know if will be

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,139
called DevOps you know when it brings in

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,419
everyone in the company but you can

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,270
imagine we've heard data ops we've heard

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,770
SEC all product daya it's going all the

00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,770
way up and we see it with development

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,639
teams operation teams IT teams obviously

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,740
security comes in but we're seeing

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,660
designers we're seeing marketers we're

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,729
seeing product managers data analysts

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,919
and business owners start to come into

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,330
these smaller teams because the

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,550
decisions that you make when there is

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,930
essentially no physical limit to how

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,790
fast are frequently you can change your

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,070
product means that those people need to

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,160
be interlocked and so we started moving

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,710
from this phase maybe where

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,500
predictability was respectability of the

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,990
great companies of the past ge is a

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,150
great company they were lauded for their

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,550
organizational structure I would say

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,500
that that's transforming now and it's

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,450
about how agile and how quick you can

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,880
adapt and so it's not synchronized

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,169
planning it's actually planning really

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,120
quickly with the right people how

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,910
quickly you can adapt but that almost

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,710
sounds like it's a point in time this is

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,720
a continual adaption that we're going to

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,789
be going through is that a fair

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,470
description of the future yeah I mean

00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,479
there is no done right there not an

00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,479
invention as soon as you're done

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,900
evolving or done reformed as practice

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,690
right

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,970
someone will lap you and so I think

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,070
software as a technical practice has

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:10,190
started to build that mindset amongst

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,110
any part of the business and so maybe

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,169
your release cycle was six months or a

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,639
year or two years in the past and

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,680
everybody would plan on a calendar

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,840
around that planning now is driven by

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,780
the customer the competition events in

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,810
the market and it's incredibly faster

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,040
and so you know it's sad to say but the

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,530
launch party is dead

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,140
is actually I think a good thing but

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,840
it's not fun so we have maybe success

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,730
parties or metric party so it's not

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,130
about shipping and then having a party

00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,690
actually shipping is the beginning so

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,100
you can imagine if you ship a software

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,100
product and then everyone goes out and

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:49,340
hits the bar and it goes down that is do

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,950
not know not the other great so we're

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,420
seeing this almost evolution where it's

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,150
continuously variable technology so it's

00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,560
never done you release a bit of code and

00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,630
you change it and tweak it based on

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,270
performance based on usage so the launch

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,520
party isn't we shipped it we're done the

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,260
launch party is the thing that we wanted

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,810
to deliver to customers is actually

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,460
being used by customers or it's helping

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,290
that the problem that we had and I guess

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,630
it's a mindset shift almost a feedback

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,830
loop party or something yeah feedbacks

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,460
getting faster right I think all of

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:22,760
that's been delivered by and I think

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,100
when I was about 15 or 12 I had ICQ an

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,220
AOL Instant Messenger and that was

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,350
really fast and I never thought that

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,920
faster than email right faster than

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,590
snail mail

00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,520
I never thought that in a professional

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:40,190
sense my entire team lives inside of the

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,570
chat tool not only do alerts and

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,190
monitoring tools come into that chat

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,750
tool but they get work done in that tool

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,600
faster and so something that was

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,640
consumer has come into the enterprise

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,340
and actually become part of that fast

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,380
feedback loop so if a products not

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,210
hitting that that goal will get a

00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,010
monitor monitoring alert that will ping

00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,960
the room and will actually ping the

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,460
right people to say hey we have an issue

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,350
Shawn Angela and Bill go and it'll tag

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,950
us and so that feedback loop is almost

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,950
instant so instant loop but if you look

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,720
forward like 12 months from now because

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,670
things are changing as you say really

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,740
quick yeah and this continual

00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,100
transformation is going to go on and on

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,150
and on if you were to say let's stop the

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,320
clock twelve months from now

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:30,100
what would you like to say you're doing

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,200
differently at that time so I had last

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,539
seen not to shoo yeah yeah me I'll be

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,330
let's see how that personal goals aside

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,820
but I think at Atlassian you know

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,169
sometimes we we joke that we build

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,270
software for people who build software

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,880
but actually I would say over the next

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,279
12 months you will see us move from

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,290
thinking about software teams to

00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,089
thinking about all of the teams within a

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,250
company because it takes all of the

00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,810
teams now within a company to really

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,470
build and ship a product right it's not

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,700
just software taking orders building

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,230
something over a 12 month period the

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,060
whole team collaborates on it and so

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,390
designers have been left out of that

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,540
process historically data analysts

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,890
didn't exist or we had business analysts

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,140
right but data science data engine

00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,610
artists management product managers a

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,190
lot of times they've been left out of

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,050
this software development process and so

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,240
we see all of them coming in and it's

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,279
something behind this product that we

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,920
recently acquired called Trello Trello

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,560
is a way for teams to organize their

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,140
work across groups in a very visual way

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,080
and so software teams have for years

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,120
used scrum and Kanban to organize their

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,800
work those practices I think are

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,600
expanding out so non-technical people

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,940
and so we'll see designers business

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,620
leaders data scientists getting more

00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,550
closely involved and I think Trello is

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,470
something that's going to drive them

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,970
excellent we look forward to 12 months

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,050
from now on all right which option

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,920
Thanks you don't up to do the conference

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,920
Cheers

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,760
