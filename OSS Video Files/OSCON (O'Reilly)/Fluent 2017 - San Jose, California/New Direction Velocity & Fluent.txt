	00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:08,549
we're out here to talk about change 2016

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,049
has been a year of significant change on

00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:14,999
many fronts on our front James came on

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,210
board as a co-chair when John all spa

00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:20,100
decided to write off into the sunset oh

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,820
no he rose to a position of illustrious

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,380
leadership of CTO at it see also that we

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,660
have a few more announcements to make

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,590
today and i'm going to start these by

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,140
reflecting on how pivotal Steve Souders

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,050
has been in this whole thing we call

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,839
velocity this started because of steve

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,719
Steven Jesse Robbins back in two

00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:44,760
thousand seven got together and said hey

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,059
we should do a thing we we have some

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,729
shared interests and issues and and that

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,190
became velocity and steve was pivotal in

00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,260
rallying people behind the importance of

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,059
web performance and helping spark what

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,449
really became DevOps and he's also the

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,500
longest-running external co-chair for

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,890
any O'Reilly event ever at nine years

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,990
which is yeah that's amazing to think of

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,460
that's a nice way of saying I'm the

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:21,560
oldest one to you look right for your

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,020
right thank you very well put I look me

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,090
so yeah so we're all really sad that

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,170
this is going to be Steve's last year as

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,680
a velocity co-chair um yeah so can we

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:43,430
please have a big big round of applause

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:45,630
these powders um we're not done yet so

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,360
some of you may know that Steve is a

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,180
dedicated swimmer have you been on in

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,670
the pool on this trip after wednesday i

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,530
will be back in the fall yeah it's been

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,440
busy the last little a little busy

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,400
yesterday and yeah some of you may know

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,710
that steve is also an aspiring surfer

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:09,690
yeah what is aspiring the right word

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:12,750
poser but we thought that there would

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,680
that the best parting gift we could give

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,719
you is

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,519
some incentive because we like to talk

00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,930
about incentives a lot so you become a

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:26,719
better faster surfer so with that we got

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:30,480
you a little gift okay coming out hahaha

00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:33,030
this is just a prop I didn't want to be

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,650
a good idea to ship the actual surfboard

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,810
all the way to Amsterdam and then force

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,840
you I'm not to get that know so it's oh

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,340
my gosh on the way to your house while

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,709
you're here wow my friends who is a very

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,930
big time surfer in Hawaii I gave him the

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,760
best of your specs that I could and he

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,900
told me the best board I could get you

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,129
for an aspiring non poser surfer so we

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,510
hope you felt like it might be too

00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:03,000
advanced for me it'll look really good

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,400
in the condo well it's it's an

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,930
opportunity right it's uh yeah something

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,480
to inspire don't work on learning

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,400
opportunity but we figured you needed a

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,980
new way to go fast I'm really glad you

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,819
didn't forget here to yesterday but the

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,190
record let me carry this on really

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,159
really bad logistics um oh that's

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,859
fantastic from us from O'Reilly from the

00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:29,819
whole velocity community we wanted to

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:33,030
just thank you and it's not going to be

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,359
the same well the you mentioned about

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:40,829
Jesse and I you know helping to create

00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:43,379
this and the thing that got it off the

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,989
ground was all riley publishing high

00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,000
performance websites and so certainly in

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,810
the o'reilly runs velocity and so

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,459
o'reilly really you know laid the

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,829
foundation and the opportunity for this

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,959
for the book and for velocity to come

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,870
about so you know Jesse and I went to

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,819
o'reilly and said we'd like to create a

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,129
environment for this community to get

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,780
together and that was nine years ago and

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,689
a rather you said okay let's try it and

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,549
it's been fantastic yeah it's been a

00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,979
wild ride for sure so thank you to all

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:19,500
riley to make it up some more okay so

00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:20,880
for the time i do should i go we're not

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,079
going yet so hoping for the couple of

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,500
times we've done this we haven't changed

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,970
chairs very much we usually that other

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,410
person usually comes out

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,790
that's kind of what we did when you know

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:35,640
but she's not here so our new co-chair

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,320
has a conflicting engagement so we're

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,840
going to get to meet her here sort of

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,120
virtually so Steven James and I are

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,560
going to surf off stage and I would like

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:53,340
to introduce our new velocity co-chair

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:59,490
in as zambra hello everybody hey you're

00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:01,080
my feet high high velocity I'm so

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,090
thrilled to join this amazing group of

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,820
organizers sorry we couldn't be there in

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,890
person gordo and I are getting ready to

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,780
go snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,750
and we decided to make a video to

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,310
introduce ourselves Americanos right So

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,410
La Mina sobre and I'm a distributed

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,930
systems engineer at fastly and a

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,120
longtime fan of velocity this is Gordon

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,340
my trusty sidekick who is as passionate

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,800
as systems assistance engineering as I

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:30,330
am and he also loves chicken and cheese

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,250
we all want our systems to be resilient

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,140
performance and we deeply care about the

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,910
web being accessible for everybody in

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,650
the world this is a goal that bellassa

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,450
teams to achieve with our conferences in

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,760
Amsterdam San Francisco New York City

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,430
James Courtney and I have very exciting

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:50,580
things planned for 2017 are we hope to

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:52,800
see you there in person cheers so um

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,479
some of you probably know when John

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
Osborne Paul Hammond first spoke about

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,500
continuous deployment and now i'll call

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,050
the infamous 10 plus deploys per day

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,340
talk was one of the threads that sort of

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,930
really spawned a whole new way of

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,910
thinking about building and operating

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,040
systems on the web i know for a lot of

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,260
us i remember watching the video and

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,060
remember thinking you know oh crap this

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,790
is the iron why didn't I think of this

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,140
and why don't I build build around this

00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,180
sort of stuff and all of a sudden you

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,150
started to see people but appear with

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,470
tools and infrastructure and ideas and

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,540
for the next sort of eight years or so

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,370
nine years or so you all attended

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,900
velocity to sort of see how the to learn

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,520
how the cake was made in the web

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,260
operations of performance world and for

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
a lot of us who came from I spent a lot

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,560
of years in enterprise it was a shock to

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,750
the system it was like this is amazing

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,280
technology in this amazing this amazing

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,409
way of doing business that

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,300
revolutionized our industry

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,860
so at the same time sort of intertwining

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,559
connected with that we saw the rise of

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,439
DevOps the cloud became significant

00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:51,479
important to us tools like configuration

00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,279
management containers and orchestration

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,409
a bunch of other disciplines and

00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,789
technologies our last speaker talked

00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,749
about emergency preparedness and

00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,459
obviously those of you know Jesse

00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:01,499
Robbins was an EMT and a volunteer

00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,769
firefighter and a lot of that sort of

00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:07,019
world has entered into our community and

00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:08,459
in our current world that methodology of

00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,559
the wave ops community it's no longer

00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,239
the domain of a few handful of shops

00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:14,969
like you know we still get amazing talks

00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:17,099
from folks like like Etsy and people out

00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:18,239
of the silicon valley community and we

00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,099
saw Astrid this morning talk about

00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:21,419
Google and the recent sre book and

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,949
things like that have come out but it is

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,479
no longer the domain of those groups

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,599
we're seeing more and more organizations

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,399
adopt this and it's become a building

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,399
block upon with how we've built our

00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,589
systems how we built these new highly

00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,110
complex highly distributed systems and

00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:39,919
architectures and we want to respond to

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,209
the construction of these systems with

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,769
anup you know a new paradigm new

00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:46,529
training and content that will help you

00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:48,809
get your arms around this as we move in

00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:51,300
that direction this explosion of new

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:53,579
approaches and tools and technologies

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,679
that James mentioned means that along

00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,709
with all the ops considerations caring

00:07:55,679 --> 00:08:00,749
about performance as a lot of us do as

00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,779
sort of as the end user experiences it

00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:05,309
means we we kind of have to go back if

00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,239
you go back down into the land of

00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:10,739
databases and hardware and the network

00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:13,319
careening through containers and

00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:18,089
navigating multitudes of micro services

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:20,099
and I'm done with that but as a result

00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,809
of that we're going to be changing the

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,459
scope of velocity and what we're

00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,289
focusing on and we're going to be

00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,449
including more distributed systems and

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:29,759
systems performance we're actually

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,519
opening the San Jose San Jose I would

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,620
get that in a minute 2017 velocity call

00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,339
for proposals today if you go to

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,769
o'reilly calm velocity call calm you'll

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,899
find it there and we're soliciting talks

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:46,079
on topics ranging from our traditional

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:49,050
domains of operations sree to new areas

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,839
including distributed systems networking

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,300
databases hardware orchestrations think

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,149
you know scheduling tracy said

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,820
wing things that topics that have

00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,890
started to appear at velocity it's not

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,420
like we're suddenly you know pulling the

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,100
covers off on something that that that

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,839
we haven't seen but we've been watching

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,760
this over the last couple of years and

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,339
realizing that the industry has been

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,450
sort of pulling these pieces apart and

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,079
now we're trying to figure out how do we

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,980
how do we stitch this all together and

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,630
we feel like this sort of still

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,850
interweaves and complements the

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:24,120
interests and passions of velocities

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:27,149
existing community but it's a change and

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,589
it also means that the very vibrant you

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,440
know sort of web performance community

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:34,440
that grew with velocity we're going to

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,120
take that show to fluent and we really

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,459
have been getting a lot of demand for

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,350
that kind of web performance content

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,820
every time Steve talks it fluent or we

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,279
inject like a little bit of that there

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,079
everybody there says we more of this we

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,910
need more of this and that's our very

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:52,620
web focused conference and so velocity

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,920
topics are going to be front and center

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,959
at fluent next year and I'm really

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,550
thrilled to announce that as a part of

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,500
that the new fluent co-chairs will be

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,320
Kyle Simpson which some of you may know

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,160
and someone many more of you likely know

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,779
which is Tammy Everts who is passionate

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,550
I don't I don't know very many people

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,399
other than Steve her as passionate and

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,740
knowledgeable about performance so it's

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,020
very exciting to have tammy coming on

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,209
board for that they're joining o'reilly

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,279
sort of internal chairs Rachel Remy

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,740
leotis and Allison McDonald I believe

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,660
they're calling themselves a table a

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,790
table yeah we're just a tripod yeah

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,339
we're notice are we more stable or less

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,700
stable I pie I don't know your grasp of

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,949
physics I guess um so but on top of all

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,660
of that news the thing that I really am

00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:42,690
excited about the most is we're going to

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,640
be co-located with fluent which is

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,470
something we've never done before so not

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,459
co-located in a sense of like after this

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,570
there's gonna be a security conference

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,730
but these are going to be running at the

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,740
same time on the exhibition hall will be

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,560
shared we will all still be there

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,089
networking sharing ideas are continues

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,890
or communities continue to grow together

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,390
so it's a lot of news to take in I'll be

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,040
around where I'll you know be hanging

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,310
out people have questions for me this is

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,920
the very TL DR version of

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,080
bigger story obviously but ultimately we

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,300
want to develop a new practice for when

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,000
you cannot fully comprehend or control

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,290
the systems you are creating how do you

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,270
architect build run em and have the best

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,190
most performant user experience possible

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,070
but still be able to react quickly and

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:31,000
confidently when things go sideways

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,000
