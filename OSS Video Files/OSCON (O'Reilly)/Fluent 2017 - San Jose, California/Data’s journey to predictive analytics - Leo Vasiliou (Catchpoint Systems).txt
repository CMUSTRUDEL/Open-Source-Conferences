	00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:08,809
alright alright uh my name is Leo vassal

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,840
ooh but you can call me Leo vassal ooh

00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:15,660
now at one of the talks this morning I

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,509
heard somebody drop a couple of f-bombs

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,039
and I said oh we can do that here so you

00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:25,529
guys are in trouble just kidding so

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,800
we've got a couple of minutes talk about

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,800
a couple of key concepts leading into a

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,180
talk that dawn and I are giving here in

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,850
a couple hours about observability

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,130
designing observable systems which I

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,860
won't spoil too much but it's going to

00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,770
be going to be pretty cool as far as

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,510
this talk though the two concepts I want

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,940
to load kind of load in if you will

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,950
change and Simpsons paradox so the first

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,530
question I have for everyone in the room

00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:05,250
is very simply please give me the length

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,700
width and height dimensions of the ice

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,810
cube from which this puddle of water

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,579
came so maybe somebody's visioning a

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,979
tray of ice cubes somebody stairs one by

00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,789
one by one you know maybe you start

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,240
thinking about some of those thoughts

00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:24,479
but but the idea here is that you you

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,359
you really can't write because it's

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,600
changed from what it was before it

00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:34,259
actually came from a big ass glacial

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:39,479
size IQ Ice Cube and ah this beautiful

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:45,049
lake island in Russia right to reinforce

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:50,159
though please now tell me how much milk

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:53,329
did it take to make this cake it's a

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,319
trick question because I use cream right

00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,149
then I mean if you guys remember from

00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,639
your physical science classes physical

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,770
change chemical change things like that

00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:03,090
no it's all one good but but the idea is

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,469
that it's changed from what it was

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,109
before you know you took some inputs

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,030
applied some magical process and we got

00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:14,220
some type of output and now we think

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,800
about data and how it changes into

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,230
information different full

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,880
most types things like that what I'd

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,650
like for you to retain at this point is

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,750
that data irreversibly irrevocably

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,500
changes into information there's no

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,330
going back

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,070
so unless you keep the raw data you

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,700
cannot turn it into new information

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,370
right

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,770
zoomy favor remember that the next one

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:42,500
here Simpsons paradox which pedia for

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,750
the text also credit for the images on

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,100
the right there but the top left you

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,620
know so I wanted to add this one and

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,090
when when subsets of data give different

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,070
conclusions then they're super set so

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,360
two lines look like they're going up and

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,640
to the right but when you look at them

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,940
in aggregate trends actually going down

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,470
all right so now making it a little

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,530
let's kind of apply this a little bit

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,240
we've got some awesome rum data from

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,330
from a user base here we're looking at a

00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,530
global view hour of day 24 hours so

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,360
midnight on the left there all the way

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,000
to 11 p.m. on the right Nunes in the

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,880
middle looks like peak starts about 3:00

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,650
for folks are waking up start use your

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,900
property they do whatever there it is a

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,760
do about five six seven they wind down

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,040
they go home that because people only

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,750
buy thing at work right a lot of things

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,880
that work and then they go to sleep in

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,209
the pattern rinse and repeats but now

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,780
what we're going to do is if we look at

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,610
say North America versus EU we see that

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,590
the conclusion that we may have drawn

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:44,300
about what speak is actually different

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,739
so slow down here a little bit because

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,360
here's how I'd like for everyone to

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,700
think about this internalize this so

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,500
pick up pick a dimension pick an

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,630
attribute so we'll start with geography

00:03:51,500 --> 00:04:00,110
so United States now pick a click a

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:02,720
platform operating system so iOS versus

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,290
Android so you know Android pick now

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,670
pick now a browser you know as a chrome

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:14,030
is built in Safari so pick chrome so

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,920
what are we three three levels deep and

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,160
think about all the different levels all

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,980
the different dimensions that come with

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,640
the internet and you could start to see

00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,490
how complex it is and when you think

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,300
about now predictive analytics and talk

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,180
about bringing it back

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,440
to data one second there we go instead

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,240
of having to know about all those

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,039
different levels all those different

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,680
dimensions all predictive analytics is

00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,900
is the idea that your tool will surface

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,360
what you need to know for you without

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,590
you having to go in all those different

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,110
levels and all those different

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:52,909
dimensions but to really hit the point

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:55,840
home my question is what did I look like

00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:58,340
before this picture was taken and the

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,419
answer is is you really don't know

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,190
because I changed from what I was before

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,599
and the night did not get much better

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,520
than that thank you very much everyone

00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:12,440
enjoy the rest of time at the show

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,440
[Applause]

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,650
