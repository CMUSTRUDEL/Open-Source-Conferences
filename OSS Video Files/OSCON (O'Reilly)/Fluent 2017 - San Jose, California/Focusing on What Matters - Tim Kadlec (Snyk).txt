Title: Focusing on What Matters - Tim Kadlec (Snyk)
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: Fluent 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	We work and live in a bubble. Our limited perspective of what it means to use technology influences the way we build, the tools we use, and the tasks we prioritize. In the process, we risk losing the most powerful thing about the internet: its ubiquity.

	00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,160
this is Bree she Borden in 2014 she and

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,690
a friend were walking down the street

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,969
and they saw a bicycle and a scooter

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,559
sitting alongside the road they hopped

00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:16,539
on them and they rode them off on the

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,740
street lady came running out of the

00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,050
house screaming at them that they were

00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,369
her kids toys so they stopped they

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,349
ditched the bike in the scooter and they

00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:24,460
quickly walked away later they were

00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,499
picked up and they were charged with

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,939
petty theft and burglary now it's

00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:29,829
important to note that Bree she had four

00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:34,000
prior offenses each one of them were

00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:34,540
juvenile misdemeanors this is Vernon

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,780
Prater

00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,850
in 2013 at the age of 41 he was picked

00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,400
up for stealing $80 worth of goods at

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,140
Home Depot now Vernon also had priors

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,020
but they were not juvenile misdemeanors

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,020
he had two armed robberies in one

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,580
attempted armed robbery now at the time

00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,440
the courts were experimenting with a

00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,330
program that would do some data analysis

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,910
run some algorithms and tried to

00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,580
determine if somebody was high risk of

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,080
being a repeat offender or not now the

00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,940
algorithm looked at Bree she looked at

00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,989
her for prior juvenile misdemeanors and

00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,539
it determined that Brisa

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,729
was a high risk they gave her a score of

00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:11,409
8 they looked at Vernon they looked at

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,210
Vernon's two armed robberies one

00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,649
attempted armed robbery and the

00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,119
algorithm determined that he was low

00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:20,020
risk of being a repeat offender and they

00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,729
gave him a score of 3 hindsight being

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,670
20/20 we can look at this and we know

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,740
that they was absolutely wrong she has

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,619
had no subsequent offenses he is serving

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,310
eight years for grand theft now in

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:35,170
isolation this is disturbing enough but

00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,389
it gets worse when you look at the

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,310
actual aggregate data so ProPublica dug

00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:41,409
in and they wanted to see how often does

00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,729
this sort of thing happen and so they

00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,530
looked at all the times that the

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:47,200
algorithm got something wrong and what

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,880
they found was very disturbing they

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,859
discovered that if you were white the

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,420
most likely mistake that the algorithm

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,920
would make was in assuming that you were

00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,929
low-risk that you were not going to be a

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,499
repeat offender when in fact you ended

00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:02,139
up repeat offending if you were black it

00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:04,240
made the opposite mistake it assumed

00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:05,799
that you were high-risk when in fact you

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,789
ended up not having any subsequent

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,489
offenses the algorithm that was in parts

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,250
built to AB pollo a human bias was

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:17,110
itself biased

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,610
there's a lot of talk right now about

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,920
whether or not technology is political

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,080
whether or not technology is biased but

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,000
of course it is it can't help but be

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,590
political and biased because we the

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,569
people building it our political and

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,040
biased and we infuse those biases into

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,739
the technology we build whether or not

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,370
we realize it and sometimes in

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:38,830
retrospect at least it's obvious but

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,049
here's the thing we don't build

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,450
algorithms like this I'm willing to bet

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:44,560
most of you in here do not do things

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,239
like this where it's fluent we're

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,970
front-end developers or designers we

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,040
write HTML CSS JavaScript we work on

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,079
retail sites on social media sites for

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,690
startups for financial institutions we

00:02:53,079 --> 00:03:00,310
don't impact people's lives in the same

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,260
way but our limited perspectives and our

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,760
biases end up influencing the way that

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,959
we build each and every day and even if

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,450
the impact isn't quite as obvious

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,450
obvious at first glance it's still there

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,200
