Title: The end of "personal" computing... - John Allsopp (Web Directions)
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: Fluent 2017 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	The era of so-called "personal" computing (as we've known it for 40 years) is coming to a close. John Allsopp explores the ways in which personal computing has become deeply impersonal and how the modern age of apps, screens, and devices that bring personal computing to us on the go is evolving and impacting human interaction.

if you think about our visions of the

00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:10,040
future of computing right they often

00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,360
come from sci-fi and and you know we

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,340
think of things like Terminator and

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,170
Robocop and these heads-up displays and

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,210
the kind of glasses that we wear that

00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,910
somehow allow us to get these stuff

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,789
overlaid on our life right Google glass

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,680
is a real-world example of that what we

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,720
call augmented reality or AR and there's

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,670
enormous about a mount of hype around

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,250
this I mean only a couple of weeks ago

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,840
in this very room one of most exciting

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,930
things that Apple announced with a our

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,670
kids and AR but the challenge in AR is

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,700
that it's still really heavily relies on

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,590
our visual cortex and as our experience

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,530
with Google glass and the term glass

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,090
Hall proved that it still very much gets

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,090
in the way of human to human interaction

00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,969
but you know humans have been using our

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,070
ears and our voice to communicate

00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:57,410
complex ideas far longer than we've been

00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,840
using our visual cortex on our site and

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,930
I'm really interested in where that

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,699
might take us these are probably the

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,920
most well known but certainly not the

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,869
only kinds of devices and I like to

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,270
think of the kind of Apple one or the

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,420
terrorist 80 or the the early

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,760
microcomputers of our age not just

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,040
wireless headsets they are really

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,740
computers that we are already embedding

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,200
in our body and if you can imagine with

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,090
Moore's law and kumys law of battery

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,130
life in the next year or two and out

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,600
into the next few years how much smaller

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,280
and more powerful they're going to be

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,159
we're literally going to be wearing them

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
every everywhere we go every day as part

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,960
of our life I'd like to think of

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,280
cochlear implants now at the intensive

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,140
nine hundreds of thousands of people get

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,479
these implanted into their lives every

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,520
year and I think that's a model of where

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,520
these devices may well be going

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,060
