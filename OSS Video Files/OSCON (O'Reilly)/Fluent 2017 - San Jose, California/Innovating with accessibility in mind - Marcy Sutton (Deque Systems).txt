Description: 
	Building a better web means removing barriers for users and helping them live more productive lives.

so you might be thinking oh this

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
accessibility thing that means that

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,780
websites are boring and they all look

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,420
the same

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,740
well that is not true websites don't

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,230
have to be boring to be accessible

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,480
there's so many examples one of my

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,700
favorites is from simply accessible

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,590
which is an accessibility company they

00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,020
rebranded a few years ago and their

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,180
website is just beautiful it's well

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,300
architected so all the content is really

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,399
easy to digest their brand is really

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,460
memorable and recognizable it's

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,350
accessible and they have these really

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,539
cute illustrations that sort of tie it

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,600
all together and so they are doing

00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:45,690
something really well there another

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,579
example is a few iterations ago of the

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,280
target corporate website that I got to

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,289
work on working on this site was really

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,350
cool because targets brand is so

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,649
recognizable and fun to work with and

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,570
this site I got to prototype

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,789
accessibility and responsive design

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,280
together early in the process and it

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,470
made it really successful because every

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,479
interaction I got to play with the

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,790
ramifications of accessibility and

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,759
responsive design together so that then

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,710
it could be highly interactive and so it

00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,890
doesn't have to be boring at all but the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,049
earlier you start the better so

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,090
accessibility can be super cutting edge

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,090
at the same time like it doesn't have to

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,280
be a static website in the traditional

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,740
sense with full page refreshes and

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,979
things so I'm going to play a video for

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,189
you of an education platform by

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,740
blackboard where it's a super modern

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,079
JavaScript heavy application with layers

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,030
and they've managed accessibility really

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,909
well so I want to show you what that

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,240
looks like and sounds like because it's

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,649
for education in particular people with

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,659
disabilities need to get an education

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,609
just like everyone else they need to get

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,649
jobs just like everyone else and have

00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,539
those opportunities so for these

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,159
platforms it's critical that they be

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:07,140
accessible HTML content to enter the

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,720

selected all right so that's a screen

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,579
reader he's never seen one operating

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,709
before that is voiceover which if you

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,510
have a Mac or an iPhone you have a

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,890
screen reader if you have an Android

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,079
device you have a screen reader in your

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,329
pocket and what I really like about

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,950
blackboards application is that even

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,750
though they have these layers opening on

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,600
top they send your focus to that new

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,760
layer for a few reasons one so it's

00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,470
announced in a screen reader and two so

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,209
that your keyboard focus is in the right

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,730
part of the app you're not stuck on a

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,709
previous layer they also did a really

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,630
good job of labeling their icon buttons

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,850
although admittedly they could probably

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,980
benefit from some text labels under

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,780
those icons at the very least for a

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,639
screen reader user an icon button

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,220
explained what it was for like a

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,200
calendar and then further they had

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,630
similar icon buttons where they had

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,069
multiple instances of the same icon but

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,380
they did different things and they were

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,389
all labeled uniquely so that a screen

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,579
reader user would be able to tell one

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,560
settings button from another and when I

00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,320
added new content there was a little

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,229
plus button and it told you where you

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,479
were in the hierarchy of documents it

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,950
would say add new content above new

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,930
document so it sort of spatially away

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,120
when they use template into create this

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,460
application they're actually looking at

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,650
the content around it to make it usable

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,100
and actually intuitive to someone with a

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,100
