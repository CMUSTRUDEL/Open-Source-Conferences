Title: Data orchestration for AI, big data, and the cloud - Haoyuan Li (Alluxio)
Publication date: 2019-06-28
Playlist: The O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2019, Beijing, China
Description: 
	The data ecosystem has heavily evolved over the past two decades. Thereâ€™s been an explosion of data-driven frameworks, such as Presto, Hive, and Spark to run analytics and ETL queries and TensorFlow and PyTorch to train and serve models. On the data side, the approach to managing and storing data has evolved from HDFS to cheaper, more scalable and separated services typified by cloud stores like AWS S3. As a result, data engineering has become increasingly complex, inefficient, and hard, particularly in hybrid and cloud environments.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,020
so the third approach which is what

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,639
we're proposing is that you abstract and

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,519
off-street the data that's the solution

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,830
that we are proposing and essentially

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,379
this will create a new layer for that

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,670
for the whole IT industry and hopefully

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,810
this will solve the issue and it will

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,430
prove how how it does so so we talked

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,740
about the trend of the industry in the

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,800
society and let's see let's take a

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,019
single organization view how their data

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,660
journey over the past 10 years has been

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,180
through and then we use the same example

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,550
where the data extraction data

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,489
extraction system to showcase how they

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,399
work differently so at the beginning you

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,370
have a hive with HDFS to do sequel query

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,649
very slow and and gradually you find a

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,020
faster system house Park you do another

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,180
way you build another system and another

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,800
HDFS and now you want to do machine

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,590
learning you do what do you do you do a

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,480
tons of flow with NFS you have to

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,520
migrate the data have to have

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,460
duplication the data all over these

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,340
different places and that now was even

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,869
fun you have the cloud and then you

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,700
migrate some of your data into the cloud

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,040
you have the data security issue for

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,530
sure at the same time you have spark

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,840
there you say oh I'm cloud company and

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,119
the next one you wanna write oh this

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,369
faster query engine called presto and

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,259
want to live stat and you want to go

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,840
across the run because now object store

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,610
is popular and the other thing is you

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,500
want to use another cloud you have multi

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,810
cloud strategy and you want to query

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,799
HDFS data which is on your in your own

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,200
primary environment

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,350
that is the status quo this is how the

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,329
leading companies over the past 10 to 15

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,630
years how their journey went through

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,500
that's that's side that's cool so then

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,630
let's see

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,850
wait they stay the execution system

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,130
what's the difference so you build a

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,079
hive and hive on top of this data

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,390
actuation system only interact with that

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,219
and data abstraction system will

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,560
interact with all the storage systems

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,170
and then you have a spark you do not in

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,409
tribute another HDFS anymore you save

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,509
lots of cycle from the IT invited

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,879
department and your base is much more

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,920
agile a much more effective efficient

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,680
and similarly now you have tons

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,870
floo never to worry about how to access

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,330
the data again I talk to this data

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,540
actually orchestration system and which

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,090
will talk to you both HDFS and an NFS

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,880
like a local laptop very simple and then

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,950
you have sparks similar story your

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,989
presto and moving forward

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,360
it is about any it's about any

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:39,239
data-driven application which you will

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,420
see more in five years you see another

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,750
wave innovation beyond whatever it is

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,209
popular today so that's the the what's

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,959
that's how the world will evolve with

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:55,560
this new layer new system new concept in

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,750
the stack in the IT industry so then

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,840
they stay the oxidation system for the

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,330
craft it provides three major function

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,370
three major major values from the

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,860
technical perspective you have the data

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,519
locality you have a data accessibility

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,100
and you have the data elasticity for the

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,170
AI and big data workloads and any data

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,720
workers we any data were close moving

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,900
forward that's the technical side and

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,450
then from the business perspective from

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,609
the from what's the impact from business

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,549
perspective is that you have far more

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:32,670
effective far more effective data

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:36,150
platform so that enable your business to

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,269
grow to be several times more efficient

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,239
than before of leveraging the data so

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:45,030
you can say if your say there are two

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,709
companies a and B they're competing and

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,170
one company may have this type of

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,780
platform improve their internal

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,000
efficiency for the data people like

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,280
machine learning a I people for four

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,750
times and over the time three years

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,000
later competing with another

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,310
organization be you know what will

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,140
happen and that's the number one

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,630
importance and you have the data

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,700
strategy a a strategy and you have the

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,950
platform and number a much more

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,959
effective and on top of that you know

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,930
it's faster it's cheaper it's called

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,500
saving but in the end of the day is its

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,900
will embrace it will enable much more

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,020
application being based on the data and

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,860
the whole company the whole organization

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,860
will be more effective

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,820
