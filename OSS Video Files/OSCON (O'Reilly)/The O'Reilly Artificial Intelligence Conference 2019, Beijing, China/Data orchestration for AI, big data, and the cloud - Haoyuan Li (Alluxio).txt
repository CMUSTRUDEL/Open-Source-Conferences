Description: 
	The data ecosystem has heavily evolved over the past two decades. Thereâ€™s been an explosion of data-driven frameworks, such as Presto, Hive, and Spark to run analytics and ETL queries and TensorFlow and PyTorch to train and serve models. On the data side, the approach to managing and storing data has evolved from HDFS to cheaper, more scalable and separated services typified by cloud stores like AWS S3. As a result, data engineering has become increasingly complex, inefficient, and hard, particularly in hybrid and cloud environments.
