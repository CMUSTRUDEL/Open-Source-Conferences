	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
so we wanted to take a few minutes to

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,200
highlight the results some of some

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,260
recent surveys and along the way

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,910
describe some trends in AI and highlight

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,000
some of the upcoming talks at the

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,279
conference so first as many of you are

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,850
aware a AI and machine learning are

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,130
extremely active research areas and for

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,590
the most part that research is being

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,000
done out in the open the website

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,750
archive.org a very popular online

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
website for preprints had an average

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,809
daily upload of a hundred machine

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,329
learning papers in 2018 and all that

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,000
research is being translated to patent

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,160
filings I was fortunate enough to take

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,860
part in a recent study by the World

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,110
Intellectual Patent Office and I say you

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,809
can see the rate of patent filings is

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,789
also growing very fast and this

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,340
reinforces the notion that we have

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,699
entered the implementation phase for AI

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,339
technologies in fact there was a

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,680
six-fold increase in annual patent

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,920
filings over the 12-year period spanning

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,200
from 20 from 2006 to 2017 and in fact

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,700
53% of all the patents in AI were filed

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,880
after 2013 drilling down into specific

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,970
areas computer vision as many of you are

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,909
aware there are many startups and many

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,280
commercial use cases to have computer

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,070
vision and we will have a lot of

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,159
sessions about computer vision at this

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,780
conference now it's been a extremely

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,570
productive year for researchers in

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,310
natural language every few months it

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,290
seems like there seem to be new deep

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,689
learning models that established records

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,270
in many different natural language tasks

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,500
and benchmarks much of this research was

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,720
done in the open

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,189
accompanied by open source code of pre

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,259
trained models which is great for the

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,030
entire community and we are already

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,979
seeing companies begin to tune these

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,469
models for their specific domains and

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,450
applications there are many sessions on

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,819
text speech and natural language at this

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,250
conference including a talk on transfer

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,830
learning today by David Lowe of panned

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,210
AI we continue to see

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,090
treatments and tools for deep learning

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,160
as well our surveys show that pencil and

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,260
pad Taurus remain in the most popular

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,410
libraries now what framework are

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,240
practitioners and companies using a

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,850
recent study by UC Berkeley Ryze lab

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,500
shed some light on this question for

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,230
each monk they looked at the number of

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,180
questions posted on Stack Overflow

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,220
tagged with each framework Stack

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,980
Overflow if you recall is a question and

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,410
answer site for programmers tensorflow

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,170
is clearly the more popular framework

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,110
from January 2017 through the end of

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,110
April of this year of 2019 in this

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,940
afternoon quezon Wang of Google will

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,480
give a talk outlining what's new for

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,540
tensorflow 2.0 now what framework are

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,790
researchers using the same study by used

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,740
to burglarize lab shed some light on

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,680
this question so for each month they

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,180
looked at the number of papers now post

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,209
on our archive that mention each

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,570
framework and from January 2017 through

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:19,230
December 2018 tensorflow was the most

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,709
cited work among researchers but things

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:26,310
are beginning to shift by April 2019 a

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,050
PI torched surpassed tensor flow to the

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,090
extent that researchers are early

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,420
indicators look for PI to also gain

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,830
users among practitioners and companies

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,239
joseph is AK of Facebook will be joining

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,100
us and he will give an update on the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,500
current state of Pi torch tomorrow

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,550
morning so in our recent survey that

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,130
drew over 1300 respondents about 22%

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,560
signaled that they are beginning to use

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,019
reinforcement learning so there are many

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,940
reasons for this but one of the main

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,610
reasons it's that we just have more

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,000
tools open source for Prai Terry and

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,980
cloud services for doing RL so we have a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,950
couple of keynote speakers over the next

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,850
few days and we'll talk about

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,260
reinforcement learning including

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,840
professor Yan steiker

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,870
from UC Berkeley Rice lab and Professor

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,760
Tim Kroshka of MIT last year we began

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,530
tracking many startups building

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,410
specialized hardware for deep learning

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,500
and AI both for training and inference

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,169
and both for use in edge devices as well

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,820
as data centers towards the latter part

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,400
of this year we expect some of these

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,290
company

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,030
to began releasing hardware that would

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,400
greatly accelerate both training and

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,350
inference while being much more energy

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,240
efficient at this conference we have a

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,550
few talks on next-generation hardware

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,750
including keynotes by a Tom Medina

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,790
Habana and micro James a cerebral now

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,610
this is all in the beginning to

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,460
translate into actual investments now in

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,650
our past recent survey we found out over

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,830
60% of companies were planning to invest

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,660
at least some of their IT budget into AI

00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,970
but the level of investment depends on

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,150
how much experience a company already

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,530
has with AI technology as you can see

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,280
from this slide those two mature

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,320
practices plan to invest a small sizable

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,940
portion of their IT budget into AI and

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,190
as a result there's a strong likelihood

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,370
that the gap between leaders and

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:22,060
laggards were widen in the space so what

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,220
is holding back adoption of AI so

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,160
according to our survey the answer

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,840
depends also on the level of maturity

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,110
those who are getting started still

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,580
struggle with finding use cases or

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,940
explaining the importance of AI and

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,760
machine learning to their fellow

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,430
employees on the other hand those with

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,830
mature practices struggle with things

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:48,430
like lack of data and lack of skilled

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,110
people as the use of AI technologies

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,430
grows within companies we will need

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,860
better tools for machine learning

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,720
development and tools that can automate

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,060
many stages of a machine learning

00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,160
pipeline at this conference we have many

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,580
talks on automation and data platforms

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,039
including a talk on Auto ml by cui sway

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,410
of Microsoft this afternoon and a talk

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,360
from racket and tomorrow on best

00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,810
practices for building a data science

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,610
team now with this shift towards the

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,520
implementation of machine learning it's

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,070
natural to expect that tools targeted

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,039
helping companies with with ml practices

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,690
will start to improve as well as you can

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,520
see we are beginning to track the many

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,190
companies and open source projects for

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,470
model development governance and

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,699
operations and these are all active

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,669
areas for researchers and entrepreneurs

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:40,210
so expect rapid progress in the next 12

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,960
months now companies are realizing that

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,100
machine learn

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,389
a I involve much more than optimizing

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,819
individual business or statistical

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,090
metrics and we have many speakers or

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:54,490
over the next two days who will explain

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:58,780
various techniques that are being used

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,759
to develop responsible AI in one recent

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,340
survey we found many companies are

00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,139
beginning to check for things like

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,960
explained ability fairness and bias

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,000
security and privacy safety and

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,280
reliability in fact many of these topics

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,780
are very active areas of research and

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,000
much of that research is being

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,520
translated into new tools and best

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,810
practices we have a few talks on these

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,509
topics including a session this

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,509
afternoon on federated learning by Alex

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:28,030
Ingram in of Google so check that out we

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,220
are also seeing companies begin to

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,889
retrain their workforce on topics

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,710
pertaining to AI and machine learning so

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:38,979
here are some high-level results from a

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,080
recent analysis we did of content usage

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,659
and O'Reilly learning platform so for

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,250
those of you are not familiar

00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,919
subscribers to O'Reilly learning have

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,039
access to books live online training and

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,710
video so let's examine the largest

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,400
topics on all Riley learning in terms of

00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:00,340
content usage from January to May 2019

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,789
in this chart the size of a square is a

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,860
proxy for the popularity of a topic the

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,289
color of square reflects the rate of

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,509
growth where green means the topic is

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,320
growing and red means the topic smaller

00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:16,719
in 2019 compared to what it was in 2018

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,719
and as you can see there are many topics

00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:24,219
related to AI machine learning and data

00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:26,650
among the most popular topics now among

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:28,630
the trending topics which we also see

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,360
quite a few that are related to AI

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,070
machine learning and data so all of

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,320
these are early science that companies

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,120
and employees are beginning to update

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,200
their skills for the AI and machine

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,390
learning era to summarize we are in the

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,060
implementation phase for AI machine

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,529
learning tools are improving use cases

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,839
and case studies are being shared more

00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,990
widely and companies and employees are

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,490
beginning to update their skills as we

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,020
noted earlier

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,420
once ina companies are taking AI

00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,209
seriously is to look at the growth and

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,250
patents computer vision which is the

00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,529
topic of several keynotes and such as

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,810
here over the next two days is by far

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,779
the most popular application area for

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,580
current AI technologies many companies

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,680
have long collected text as well and

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,620
many have experienced we have using MLP

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,029
NLP and text mining tools recent

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,100
progress and deepening for language

00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,630
models will also surely result in many

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,149
new and interesting applications within

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,250
that space and don't forget that we are

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:30,040
still in the early days for speech

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,720
applications but even at this stage we

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,610
are already seeing many interesting

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,130
consumer and enterprise applications

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,860
emerge so we are still in the early

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,709
stages of machine learning and AI within

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,899
companies tools to trap and manage

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:46,720
experiments and ant and machine learning

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:49,330
pipelines are beginning to appear we

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,970
look forward to tools for building the

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,830
AI applications of tomorrow and I

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,350
encourage you to walk around the expo

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,589
hall as many of our sponsors might

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,649
already have what you need and in fact

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:05,200
we have an academic project here at the

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,050
conference from MIT called Northstar

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,910
it's located near the O'Reilly booth so

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,540
I encourage you to check out this MIT

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,339
project so we have another outstanding

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,770
program for you over the next few days

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:20,110
there will be many sessions on topics

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:24,550
that are critical to sustaining the use

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,260
of AI within your organization's as much

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,230
as we love the programís conference

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,000
organizers we encourage you to network

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,240
with other people at the conference so

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,100
so with speakers with the companies in

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,270
the expo hall as well as with your

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,920
fellow attendees and just to highlight

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,230
the importance of networking we've

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,149
arranged so that many of our keynote

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,450
speakers will make themselves available

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:51,279
at lunch for informal discussions so for

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,940
the next few days this is your AI

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,940
community

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,890
