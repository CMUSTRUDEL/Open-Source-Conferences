Title: Designing computer hardware for artificial intelligence - Michael James (Cerebras)
Publication date: 2019-06-28
Playlist: The O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2019, Beijing, China
Description: 
	Artificial intelligence is defining a new generation of computer technology with applications that blur the boundaries between intuition, art, and science. These technologies are powered by a new paradigm: instead of handcrafting algorithms as long instruction codes, AI algorithms result automatically from applying data to models. This has direct implications on how computer hardware is designed for the new technology frontier.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,460
in our field we've been building

00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:08,010
computers for about 80 years think about

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,519
that this is the ENIAC is the first

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,219
electronic computer and even in its day

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,400
it was described as a gigantic brain and

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,720
since then computers have gotten faster

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,449
and faster a year after year basis

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,910
exponentially today each one of you has

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,660
the equivalent power of more than 50

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,119
million

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,820
Eenie acts in your pocket as a mobile

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,160
phone and despite all of this our

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,930
machines today still are not intelligent

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,590
in many ways modern computing is pretty

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,200
much the same as it was in 1945 this is

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,090
a modern data center and look at it it

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,559
even looks the same their cables

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,300
everywhere what I want to focus on is

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,460
not how they look the same but how in

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,070
some sense machines are still operating

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,050
the same way so our paradigm of

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,840
computing was invented by Alan Turing

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,360
and the way it works is a computer

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,549
programmer can specify a sequence of

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,090
instructions and this is a computer

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,680
program we do this all the time and what

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,900
was special about it he called it a

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,750
universal computer because he was able

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,240
to prove that for any algorithm whatever

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,520
you might imagine you can specify some

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,610
sequence of instructions that carries

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,920
out that task and so we thought if we

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,049
can just keep making computers faster

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,400
maybe eventually someone will discover

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,710
an algorithm for intelligence now with

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,270
AI what we're seeing today is that

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,939
that's not quite the way it works

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,000
instead somebody shows up our AI

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,040
practitioners come with a model maybe a

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,200
neural network and you specified this

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,659
hypothesis that's the input to the

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,820
machine you then pour a bunch of data

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,369
over this and as data fluxes through

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,130
this model it acts on the parameters of

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,530
that model to create trained weights and

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,049
these weights the output of the machine

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,180
is the equivalent of the computer

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,799
program so we're using data and

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,819
experience to generate the program

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,800
instead of specifying it by hand and you

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,260
can see how this works if we consider

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,970
computers have been used to solve the

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:24,600
games of chess and go this is Garry

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:28,400
Kasparov playing IBM's deep blue in 1997

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,270
and when IBM solved this game they

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,270
solved in the same way that you might

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:38,430
solve tic-tac-toe I so what they did is

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,070
they searched the game tree and they had

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,710
a group of software and hardware

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,540
engineers and even go masters on their

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,120
team perfecting some rules to say is

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,010
this board configuration better or worse

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,020
than some other board configuration and

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,150
then they let it go at the greatest

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,280
scale they could build at that time but

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,500
when they won the match that machine did

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,350
little else other than play the game of

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,880
chess and in fact IBM dismantled that

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,660
machine afterwards because it didn't

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,140
have any other uses if you compare this

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,470
to the recent match of google's deepmind

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,760
tim against lisa doll playing go they

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,860
did something very different

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,170
they used a convolutional neural network

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,209
and a reinforcement learning setup and

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,420
they didn't have a single go master

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,030
anywhere on their team instead their

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,670
software played the game of go millions

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:34,050
of times against itself and had learned

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,510
the art of playing go and convolutional

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,610
neural networks i they don't have a

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,590
single if-then-else statement anywhere

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,080
in them it's just a bunch of mathematics

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,209
and what what I think is most special

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,130
about this is it generalizes so that

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,470
team before they demonstrated go to the

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,120
world showed us convolutional nets in

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,630
reinforcement learning playing Atari

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,560
video games like a child might and

00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,090
convolutional neural networks are also

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,300
used in image captioning systems this is

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,180
what a CNN had to say about about Lisa

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,620
dolls match a man is studying a board

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,750
game okay so that this breadth of

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,140
applicability brings back Alan Turing's

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,690
original question is it possible that a

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,790
machine built of parts could have the

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,000
same general intelligence that a person

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,680
does and we clearly in our field have a

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,780
long way to go before this might be

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,570
achieved

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,180
but today the vehicle to explore this

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,710
question is the graphics processing unit

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,790
and this is what most people are using

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,400
and so as hardware designers we step

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,130
back and ask the question is it possible

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,340
that a device designed to put pixels on

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,220
a monitor is the ideal vehicle to

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,610
explore artificial intelligence is this

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,490
the path we should be on and in truth it

00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:00,800
turns out that a GPU is just less bad

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:03,860
than a CPU and today there are over 50

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,350
projects in AI hardware and they're from

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,370
universities they're from startups like

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,480
mine and from the largest established

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:17,330
companies in the industry Google

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Facebook Amazon Intel Alibaba $0.10 all

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,979
of these companies have AI hard work

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:28,610
plays and what none of them are doing no

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:30,680
one is reinventing a GPO here's why no

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,260
matter what retrofits you make to this

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,690
car no matter how many exhaust pipes you

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,640
add to it or how many engines you pile

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,310
on it is never going to be able to do

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,830
the job of driving me from California my

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,520
home here to Beijing is just not up to

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,979
the task

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,320
and so it's true with AI as well you

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,120
need to fundamentally think of all parts

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,600
of what you're trying to do and design

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,570
that into the computer solution so what

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,720
might the hardware appliances of

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,570
tomorrow look like with a bunch of

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,510
really cool and exotic technologies on

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,960
the hardware horizon and all of these

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,760
technologies incorporate some new law of

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,919
physics into the way that actual

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,440
computation is performed and because of

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,210
that they're doing some fundamental

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,710
research we can expect these things to

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:24,229
be on maybe a 10 plus your time frame so

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,020
optical computers use the interference

00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:29,000
patterns of laser light to perform

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,390
matrix multiplication directly with

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,870
photons quantum computers put particles

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,979
into a state of superposition to solve

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,060
combinatorial problems is in quantum

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,920
physics

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,010
in neuromorphic designs burrowed

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,290
straight from biology they use analog

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,060
circuits and even crystallization in

00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,830
their manufacture process making every

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,980
manufactured device have a unique

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,680
fingerprint our community should act

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,510
should be absolutely excited that people

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,770
are investing in this and one day this

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,820
can become a reality

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:06,040
but as AI practitioners we must not wait

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,040
because AI is happening right now

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,139
