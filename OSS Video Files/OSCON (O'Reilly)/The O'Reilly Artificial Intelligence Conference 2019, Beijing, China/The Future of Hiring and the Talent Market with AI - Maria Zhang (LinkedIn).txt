Title: The Future of Hiring and the Talent Market with AI - Maria Zhang (LinkedIn)
Publication date: 2019-06-28
Playlist: The O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2019, Beijing, China
Description: 
	If the most dramatic headlines were true, we’d all be preparing for robots to take over our jobs, our lives, and, eventually, the world. But the truth is, automation and AI are doing more to improve the quality of our work than they are to replace us. Today, more companies—including LinkedIn—are focusing on human-AI interaction. LinkedIn believes that the combination of AI and human decision making achieves a better outcome than AI alone. We all know that AI is able to more efficiently handle processes that are repetitive or laborious, but AI can also help turn intuition into action at scale.

there are some core elements that

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:13,880
defines talent first is empathy our

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:17,539
ability to relate to each other and

00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:22,859
understand each other's feelings

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:27,439
second is create creativity our ability

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:34,980
to originate new ideas expressions

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:40,290
algorithms even robots last and in a way

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:45,090
most important moral and ethics our

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:51,120
sense of right and wrong and our desire

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:57,000
to be good these are the three core

00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:02,640
pillars that define talent today but why

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,420
are these qualities not replaceable by

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:14,130
AI as advanced it's AI algorithm is

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,340
today a wins chess masters at playing

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:21,869
chess defeats eSports champions at

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:25,020
playing video games AI does not have the

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:29,189
ability to understand the feeling of

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,530
another human being let me give you an

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,140
example

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,650
Lincoln's recruiter product automated a

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,829
lot of the repetitive tasks a recruiter

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,710
need to do every day such as going

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,100
through thousands of resumes to find

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,060
qualified candidates or going back and

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:56,520
forth to schedule a phone interview

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:59,570
however it will never replace getting to

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,060
know the candidate by shaking hands

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:07,439
looking at their smiles and hearing

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:11,069
their stories not only AI it's not there

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,709
to replace a recruiter a freeze a

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:17,609
recruiter from repetitive

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:20,790
mundane tasks to spend more time talking

00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:24,269
to a qualified candidate getting to know

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:28,340
one another an offer a personal

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:32,310
experience in the hiring process

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,799
another example is Zillow it's about 10

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,700
years ago actually 13 years ago time

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:42,180
flies I was on the original team that

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,790
build Zillow's flagship product called

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,319
zestimates for those of you who are not

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,409
familiar estimates can tell you on every

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,799
single day to all the homes that's in

00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:59,730
United States how much your house is

00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:03,000
worth and it is a very classic AIA

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,700
solution how the algorithm is build is

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,859
by collecting a massive amount of data

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,389
from public records from transactions

00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,810
for mortgage companies and so on and so

00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,750
forth

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,849
it has training data because houses are

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,220
being sold on a daily basis and he

00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:23,069
understands all the attributes about

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,290
these houses therefore they can predict

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:29,669
if you sell your house today how much

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,590
would you get and I set a goal when I

00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,620
was actually leading the data team there

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,449
at Zillow and we set the goal to be

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,680
pretty high percentage let's just say

00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:42,780
somewhere around 90% and you know after

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,439
years of working there I felt that

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,280
mission accomplished this is as good as

00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:52,290
it gets because I know it would never

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,989
get to a hundred percent accurate

00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:02,639
because how a house looks feels even

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,699
smells determines the last 10 percent of

00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,519
how much this house will be sold at and

00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,669
that last 10 percent is through empathy

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,090
and is something AI will never be able

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,090
to replicate

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,579
