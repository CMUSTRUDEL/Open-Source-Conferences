	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
so how do you bring AI technology into

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,519
production how do we build a product

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,170
around AI and usually you might think

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,019
okay you're just looking for the latest

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,599
paper on the sort of the greatest

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,430
advances in deep learning and then you

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,260
take that and build a product but

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,640
actually often it's quite different so

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,800
in the case of the I work in fashion

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,230
companion when we thought about the

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,119
problem our first thought was actually

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,519
we need to figure out how to actually

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,289
how the feature has to look like on the

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
website so how do we do we communicate

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,090
to the customer that this is something

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,520
that the computer has created right if

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,960
if the wording is right maybe the

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,059
customer would try it out but if the

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,070
wording is wrong there might also be a

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,629
lot of mistrust about it right so they

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,219
think like ooh this can't really fit

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,379
because it's just a computer and so on

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,120
and also how does the interface look

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,160
like is it on the side is on the other

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,170
side do we want people to be able to

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,440
select similar a single address and so

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,350
on

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,090
so that was the first thing that we did

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,239
was actually just to focus on the user

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,070
interface and interestingly so like

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,659
there are three parts the product the

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,729
machine learning method we used and the

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,409
data we used for that and for the first

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,570
step actually there was no machine

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,240
learning right so the data we had was

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,530
just hand curated so somebody sat down

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,890
with somebody who knows something about

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,799
fashion and they just sort of typed in a

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,960
few hundred outfits and then they used

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,000
that actually to try that on the custom

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,420
and see what works and then after they

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,610
iterated that they got like an MVP and

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,840
now the next step is so now they wanted

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,909
to also generalize these outfits over

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,650
the whole assortment but we still didn't

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,000
have any click data right normally when

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,750
you have something like that you're

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,460
using the click data to figure out like

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,920
what to learn sort of from customer

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,750
behavior but what we had was from

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,149
zhalong which is a part of the londo

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,579
where you you actually you talked with

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,290
the human stylist and he collects and

00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,579
puts outfits together and sent them to

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,649
you and if you like you can keep them in

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,219
our I sent them back so we had a few

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,659
years of that right which is made for a

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,000
few thousand one hundred thousand

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,890
outfits and then we used that

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,830
essentially to compute similarities

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,110
between outfit

00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,840
and we used that as an MVP and then only

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,910
sort of in the third step finally we got

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,040
to click data and we could start to do

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,190
like the usual machine learning so I

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,640
think that the message here right so so

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,260
once you go to the end consumer you

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,170
actually have to have a very iterative

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,180
way of building products and it's not

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,660
always just about the best machine

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,660
learning method

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,760
