From robotics to smart cities, one of the toughest challenges in AI today is keeping pace with all of the latest advancements and best methods to accomplish your specific business goal; and things are changing incredibly fast. The power of AI today is knowing what’s coming tomorrow.

Abigail Hing Wen catches you up on some of the most exciting recent breakthroughs in the industry, including natural language processing strong enough to generate sentences indistinguishable from a human’s, highly accurate 3D protein structure prediction to fight debilitating disease, and leaps forward in reinforcement learning, a more natural but very complex alternative to other forms of machine learning.

so let's turn to the first one and let

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,029
me first set up the problem a scientists

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,740
have been trying to solve what is known

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,500
as the protein folding problem since the

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,540
1960s this is a long-standing research

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,980
question concerned with accurately

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,900
predicting the three-dimensional

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,840
structure of a protein based on a

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,460
sequence of amino acids this structure

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,039
governs our proteins abilities to

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,109
perform its functions miss foldings can

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,699
cause in some cases diseases and

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,439
allergies including Alzheimer's

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,309
Parkinson's and cystic fibrosis

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,960
understanding how a 3-dimensional

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,239
structure is determined can help us

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,160
better predict harm to patients design

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,340
better drugs and design synthetic

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,020
proteins to fight diseases but the

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,450
possible shapes that a string of

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,010
thousands of amino acids can take is far

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,800
beyond the capacity of even the most

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,050
powerful computers to model this is a

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,090
significant factor and why the protein

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,850
folding problem has remained unsolved

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,600
for so many years but deep learning

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,149
tools are changing this google deepmind

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,280
has trained a neural network on a data

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,369
set of 30,000 known protein structures

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,780
to develop alpha fold alpha fold can

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,130
predict the three-dimensional shape of

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,610
protein structures with much more

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,770
accuracy than previously possible in

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,960
December in a competition it defeated 98

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,200
entrants predicting the most accurate

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,030
structure for 25 out of 43 proteins and

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,210
catapulting ahead of the second place

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,820
team which only predicted three as the

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,740
co-founder of deepmind said alpha fold

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,659
is really the first proof of concept

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,460
that this could work in a really

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,700
important area of science that will have

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,020
a lot of impact synthetic proteins can

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,549
even be designed to perform other

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,189
functions such as breaking down

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,229
environmental pollutants much more

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,479
research remains to be done but alpha

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,579
fold is a critical breakthrough the lays

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,590
a foundation for future ones and it's a

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,890
great example of how AI is accelerating

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,890
research

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,549
