hi Roger Margolis here vice-president of

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,569
radar at O'Reilly and it's the software

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,830
architecture conference in New York City

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,260
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,929
I'm here with Luc Brandt's the CTO of

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,839
sij welcome Luc thank you thanks for

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,740
having to introduce yourself and a

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,500
little about what the software

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,730
improvement group does as you said my

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,740
name is Luke Braun so I'm the chief

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,529
technology officer software improvement

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,990
group or short srg and maybe to

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,240
introduce the software will proof and

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,579
groove a little bit more we just opened

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,800
up our New York office which is one of

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,200
the reasons we're here and also

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,899
presenting here at the at O'Reilly

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,329
conference and what we're all about is

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,480
we help clients improve their software

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,120
quality so what we do is first of all we

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,440
first measure their maintainability and

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,960
let me explain you why because that's

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,340
very important whatever happens there's

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,809
always a reason to change there is

00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,539
regulatory change there might be a

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,190
business need there might be a

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,110
technology change as always reasons to

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,360
change and that's why your software also

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,170
needs to be easy to change now our

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,270
scientific research shows that in our

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,710
Fast Five star system that we've

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:20,759
developed that's been certified by ISO

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:24,450
that a two-star rating takes three times

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,640
more in changing your software than the

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,470
four-star system if you compare a

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,409
one-star to a five-star that's even a

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,710
factor of 10 or more so that's enormous

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,450
change so imagine that people always

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,290
want to change their software want to

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,450
make things better for their clients but

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,159
if you can't make those change so we get

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,890
also so question about performance

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,750
reliability and all the aspects that you

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,940
can imagine around

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,220
around software but we've always first

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,890
start by measuring how easy is it to

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,340
make those changes for that we implement

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,910
our platform called secret well asaji is

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,280
a part of course and we deliver our

00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,960
platform with the service so we provide

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,880
that platform that starts by measuring

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,440
the maintainability to see how quickly

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,790
you can make those changes and on top of

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,180
that we would provide additional

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,580
analysis like on reliability or

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,160
architectural analysis or performance

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,430
related etc and consultants then come in

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,209
to help you make those changes over time

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:29,130
maybe in short summary of SLG sure is

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,709
there is there something that you can

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,240
help the developers ahead of time

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,400
there's something they have access to so

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,950
that they can write better code from the

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,310
start so actually our platform is not

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,580
just for a say to monitor your portfolio

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,500
as a CIO or a portfolio manager it's

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,630
also for an architect it's also for a

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,520
developer and we have developed a number

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,540
of guidelines and for that we've

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,900
actually a book published by O'Reilly

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,970
that publishes the the way how to do it

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,420
as a developer so there's 10 guidelines

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,340
in that book that clearly describes what

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,530
you need to do to create maintainable

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,660
software as as I said before that's the

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,600
fundament on top of that you can do all

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,760
other great things now these guidelines

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,790
have also been implemented in in

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,920
software so if people have used get up

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,950
they can have a better code up that's

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,860
the name of the little tool that we

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,989
developed to help developers really make

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,910
maintainable software so they get the

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,680
rating they can very quickly see very

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,850
actual what they need to make this

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,910
changes

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,360
that sounds great are there all

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,010
languages I focus on new languages a few

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,810
frameworks and environment that's a

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,620
great question about all languages

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,540
that's it's a big claim but it's I think

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,420
275 so that's probably nearly all the

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,450
averages so that's it's a high number

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,950
and if occasionally a new language pops

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,610
up or a language that we haven't seen

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,010
before which includes very old once

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:05,250
COBOL COBOL disorder

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,960
whatever and the most modern language

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,360
but if a new one pops up the the

00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,620
concepts are very similar so in a few

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,740
weeks we can help that implement it's

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,250
pretty

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,140
limitless I would say right as we think

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,609
about the future actually not even the

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,290
future what's going on now there's a lot

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,680
of things are micro-services a lot of

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,030
concurrency and distributed systems what

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,580
is your kind of relationship to those

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,530
kind of that kind of programming well

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,910
it's it's a very interesting trend that

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,800
one of the things we do obviously we've

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,230
been doing this since 2000 I've only

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,120
been the CTO since last year but the

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,810
company has been around since 2000 and

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,280
we've been following those trends and

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,680
and our research team actually keeps

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,550
close track of that and we also know

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,990
what what those changes are and we

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,360
include them in into our architectural

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,790
models and so for instance something

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,910
like a trend towards microservices has

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,980
definitely a positive effect but there's

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,990
also downsides to it if you don't do it

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,040
well and not to go into too much detail

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,500
but of course when you when you it's not

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,500
the Silver Bullet that solves all

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,300
problems out out there so we know how to

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,580
measure those structures as well and see

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,120
what would work and what not work so

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,950
well so in very tightly coupled to

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,390
situations we later today will have a

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,390
talk about how the organization actually

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:32,100
influences the architecture of a system

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,229
how you can actually as an architect

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,689
help

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,610
help prevent the bad things going wrong

00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:39,349
there well that sounds like really a

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,990
good advice considering read the

00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:44,180
software architecture conference in New

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,279
York like what brought you to this

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,400
particular event well a couple of

00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,840
reasons of course that that talk that

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,680
we'll be doing together with Bank on the

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,840
comp one of our lead consultants will be

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,610
talking about architecture and how the

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,650
influences of the organization have an

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,199
impact on on architecture and how you

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,629
can actually work with that and work

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,789
your way through as an architect with

00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,979
some very concrete tips and tricks and

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:13,159
some some measurement tools that we can

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,439
they can use that's one obviously the

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,180
opening up of our American offices from

00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,770
where we will be serving our American

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,110
clients and hopefully expanding our

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,689
footprint and of course to be meeting a

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,999
lot of people in the community mm-hmm

00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:28,189
that sounds great we talk about micro

00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,900
services after that how about machine

00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,479
learning you know topic every move talk

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,509
yeah very interesting

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,879
it's a topic that we also do research

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,469
about because machine learning is not

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,569
just the algorithm itself it's the

00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:44,060
entire say Daigo acquisition where the

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:48,050
data is being by is biased or not it's

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,330
been and used correctly in the in the

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,000
systems that follow so when we do our

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:56,149
analysis we actually analyze the entire

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,439
chain and this well you can't say it's

00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,669
good or bad but there's there's

00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,289
definitely things to be learned from

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:05,449
some good examples on some not so good

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,789
examples I'll bet I know that putting

00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:10,610
the MLT production is not that yeah yeah

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,800
and and the the say the algorithm

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,960
component of it isn't is obviously the

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,339
one that everybody's talking about it's

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,469
probably if you look at the entire

00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,939
problem only a part of the problem you

00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:23,249
need to look at the entire chain because

00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:25,919
that's mostly where things go not

00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:28,169
well okay well great well thanks for

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,619
your time here I think so I have a great

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,339
conference

00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,339
