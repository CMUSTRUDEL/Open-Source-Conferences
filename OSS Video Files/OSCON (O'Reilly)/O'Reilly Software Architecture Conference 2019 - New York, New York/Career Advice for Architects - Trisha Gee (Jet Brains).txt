the best way to become a 10x developer

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,109
is to teach nine of the developers to do

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,849
your job as well not to get ten times

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,380
better so let's talk about how you scale

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,610
your skills by sharing your skills

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,410
sharing your experience with other

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,139
people

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,449
my favorite way is pair programming this

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,130
is not a lot of organizations are super

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,170
excited about having to developers sat

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,390
at a computer but to me this is the most

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,699
effective way to share particularly

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,869
technical skills when I went to Lmax

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,420
which is a financial exchange in London

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,219
we didn't just do it with developers we

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,410
paired every day as developers but we

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,660
also paired with business analysts we

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,190
paired with technical testers and this

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,480
way at the beginning of a story we might

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,309
sit down with a business analyst and a

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,110
tester and the business analyst would

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,789
tell us the developer what we were

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,469
trying to achieve and why we were trying

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,610
to do it and the tester would tell us

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,070
all the ways they were going to try and

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,989
break it and that way we could try and

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,239
actually create something which suited

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,610
the business purposes and that was a

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,670
quality piece of code so we use pair

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,109
programming to share knowledge about

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,340
about what we were trying to do and how

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:08,400
we were trying to do it in the best

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:10,740
quality way during the six months my

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,990
first six months at L max I learned more

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,240
about how to be a good Java programmer

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,700
than in the previous 10 years working at

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,189
half a dozen other jobs because I worked

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,630
with these fantastic people from juniors

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,450
all the way up to very senior people and

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,799
I learned about how to be a better Java

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,810
programmer I learnt the tools that we

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,759
were using the IDS for example JetBrains

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,340
IntelliJ I did just as one of them as an

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,659
example and I learned about what our

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,400
standards were I learned about the

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,810
domain I learnt so much about the domain

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,159
I learned about the trade-offs that we

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,920
took when we were implementing something

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,180
I knew that the person next to me I

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,710
could have a conversation with them

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,689
about should we do it this way or should

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,060
we do it that way and we would both be

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,040
bought into the solution the weepies it

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,320
was a really really good way to upskill

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,700
it is not two programmers sat at one

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,979
keyboard where the keyboard is a

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,630
bottleneck because the typing is not the

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,820
problem with the coding it's all the

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,930
thinking and all the bugs that you

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,909
accidentally write into the code

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,860
apart from that so pair programming is

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,119
is in my opinion the best way to share

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,530
knowledge around the team particularly

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,080
for developers but not just limited to

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,430
developers if you're not sold on pair

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,170
programming you could also look at mob

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,650
programming so mob programming is like

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,909
get ever

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,340
everyone into a room have like one

00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,430
remote keyboard a big screen and work on

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,049
a particular problem whether it's like a

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,610
production impacting big problem or

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,870
whether it's just on occasions of every

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,879
few weeks you just kind of sit down and

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,709
do some mob programming this is another

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,750
good way to all get on board and sort of

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,079
explore the code together and learn from

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,079
each other

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,020
