hi I'm Suzanne Axtell with O'Reilly

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,600
Media I'm here with Zach Jory of Aspen

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,510
mesh welcome great to have you with us

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,639
thanks Suzanne good to be here so can

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,400
you tell me what is your definition of

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,130
diversity and inclusion I think

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,560
diversity is fairly obvious I think most

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,600
of us by now know what diversity means

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,140
and that it's important to bring people

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,400
from different backgrounds and bring

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,730
them in to create a more inclusive

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,019
culture to me I think what inclusion and

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,420
this is something we're focused on and

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,660
as mesh means is putting that diversity

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,270
into action so actually taking a diverse

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,180
culture and leveraging it to make a more

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,800
innovative and empathetic culture in the

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,230
workplace and what do you think that

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,480
diversity is important what what value

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,520
do you think it brings well I think this

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,379
one is pretty well documented by now I

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,059
always think of the Gallup study which I

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,360
think is the most well-known one and I

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,039
think there are statistics in the mid 20

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,019
percentages for lower turnover rates

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,970
higher retention lower turnover rates

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,150
and then the one that I always think of

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,369
and I think it's 39 percent of companies

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,100
with very diverse cultures have better

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,890
customer success satisfaction and I

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,080
think that really speaks to kind of the

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,119
ability to be more broadly and more

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,080
deeply empathetic when you have more

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,420
diversity in your culture and what are

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,420
the challenges do you think are that are

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,549
still facing companies now for becoming

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,790
more inclusive and and more diverse I

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,369
think in tech it is still as we all know

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,070
very much a white male dominated culture

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,780
and when white males have the power it

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,579
can be hard to change those kinds of

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,500
things and I think what it requires is

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,630
doing more than just paying diversity

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,030
inclusion lip service and actually

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,040
putting some things into practice making

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,990
some commits makes documenting those

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,869
things spending some time and a resource

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,729
on I would say tipping the scales you

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,170
can actually get to diversity because I

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,000
think that's often what it takes in our

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,750
industry so what are some of the

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,060
specific things that Aspen mesh is doing

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,880
yeah one of the things we've committed

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,680
to one of our quarterly commitments is

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,500
40% diversity candidate slate for new

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,630
hires where we're growing fairly quickly

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,960
right now and we are committed to at

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,120
least 40% of our interviews being from

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,700
diverse candidates that's been great for

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,680
us we actually had two new employees

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,440
start today and another one starts in

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,150
about two weeks and two out of three of

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,890
those candidates were diversity

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,410
candidates and we think that's really

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,020
important and it's been we've made some

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,280
good diverse City hires in the last few

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,550
months and it's been really cool to see

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,890
I would say a culture with more

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,390
personality come into the office and

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,480
kind of how our team's been able to grow

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,040
around that so what are you doing to

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,650
make sure that everyone feels included

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,750
and welcomed espen mish we're doing a

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,390
few things I think beyond growing the

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,610
team in a more diverse direction we're

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,160
also do a lot of team activities that

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,020
are aimed around bringing the team

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,410
closer together so they connect more on

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,000
a human level which I think can really

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,440
be an important thing it's hard to do

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,450
that well I know not everybody loved

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,920
these kind of things but we do some fun

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,959
things like our engineering team went

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,330
curling last week and we do cooking

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,700
competitions and things like this and I

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,830
think this can be a fun way if you have

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,150
the right team especially in small teams

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,510
that are working close together to

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,880
really form human bonds which naturally

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,890
makes everybody more collaborative open

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,510
and more accepting of any differences on

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:39,380
the teams which I think can be really

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:43,190
important another perspective is the

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,620
perspective of f5 networks who is Aspen

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,260
mesh is an incubation of f5 networks so

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,070
we are all technically f5 employees and

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,739
we leverage f5 commitments and programs

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,470
around diversity inclusion one of those

00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:00,739
is what f5 calls employee inclusion

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:03,380
groups or IGS and there are four one for

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:06,560
veterans one for a multicultural one for

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,600
women in a pride EIG as well and these

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,480
are well structured programs with

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,900
funding and leaders that

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,440
do a lot of different local events with

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,299
existing communities to help f5 not only

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,100
become more diverse and inclusive but

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,410
also try to spread that in the

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,150
communities that were present in do you

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,780
have any other success stories to share

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,699
I would add maybe the best thing that we

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,010
have seen in our small team at Aspen

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,560
mesh is going from very early on

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,460
actually being a team of five that had

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,570
no diversity to now being a team of 13

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,669
that has six members that are from from

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,190
diversity background and it's been

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:51,500
really interesting I think to watch our

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,960
teams thought-process

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,510
expand and be able to consider things

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,810
from a lot more angles and really move

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,520
to new directions and this is a team

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,550
culture thing but an engineering thing

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,690
as well that are solutions to problems

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,150
that we would not have thought of before

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,060
yeah it's very important that's great

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,530
so Aspen mesh is a sponsor of the

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,020
O'Reilly diversity and inclusion

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,820
scholarship program thank you so why do

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,639
you think it's important for companies

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,530
to support diversity initiatives like

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,270
the scholarship program I think it's

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,130
very important not to just pay lip

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,260
service to these things it's a very easy

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,710
to talk about the importance of

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,470
diversity inclusion and change nothing I

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,360
think it is going to take a lot of work

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,090
in our industry to get where we need to

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,330
be and I think that includes funding it

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:44,000
with time and resources and people and

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,360
actually putting what you're saying into

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,849
action and

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,650
we're very honored to be able to help do

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:53,210
that here at at this will Riley

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,210
