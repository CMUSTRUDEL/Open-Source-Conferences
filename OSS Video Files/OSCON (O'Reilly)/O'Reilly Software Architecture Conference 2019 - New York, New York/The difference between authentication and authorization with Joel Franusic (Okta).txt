hi Roger McGough vice president of radar

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,390
O'Reilly and I'm here at the software

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:09,269
architecture conference in New York City

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,059
2019 I'm here with Joel fantastic

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,809
who's the product marketing manager at

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,160
octo welcome Joel thank you

00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:20,160
what do you think the biggest problem

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,570
facing developers today is so this is a

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,619
interesting question that I actually

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,680
think a lot about it's it's I I think

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,910
one of the things that developers worry

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,869
about a lot is not really what they

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,360
should worry about a lot of people

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,800
worrying about the latest technology you

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,850
know whether it's they should be

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,520
learning more about serverless

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,250
or about stuff like micro services or

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,390
containerization I'm pretty sure that

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,579
actually one of the largest problems

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,379
that developers faced is one of time and

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,370
this sounds kind of weird but time and

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,739
that a lot of what I deal with and a lot

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,030
of my peers deal with is the time it

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,000
takes to get the idea from your brain

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,430
into the computer and this is actually

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,460
something that we kind of get better at

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,470
and then worse at as things develop one

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,780
of the interesting things I've I've

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,460
heard of is a computer before my time in

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,250
the 1970s one from a company called

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,650
Symbolics I keep hearing from like VP

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,729
level people like senior architects one

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,600
of the the main developers in Java

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,820
mentioned this machine it's like this

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,900
magical machine and one of the cool

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,479
things about it was that it Alette

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,600
developers get code written really fast

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,009
and so I think basically anything that

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,350
blocks you from getting something out of

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,880
your head and onto a computer is is

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,790
basically that prom that that you face

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,250
we often say that programmer

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,110
productivity is the scarcest resource in

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,030
most organizations but that's not has

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,350
always been the case right like in the

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,689
old days you don't have when you were

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,090
writing on punch cards that product

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,159
programmer productivity was worth a lot

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,590
less than that machine time and I think

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,280
it's only recently now that computers

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,280
are basically free

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,690
that it's worth a lot more and so I just

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,100
see this in a lot of big companies where

00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,860
they're now optimizing for programmer

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,330
time but I think as a developer you need

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,010
to break away from a lot of these old

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,770
practices that come from the mainframe

00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,450
days when you were on a machine that was

00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,250
worth more you know each minute on that

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,770
was more it was was worth more than an

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,540
hour of your time sorry yeah right so

00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,890
given these kind of changes in hardware

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,060
cost where do you see software

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,760
development going what do you see in the

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,660
future I think one of the areas that I'm

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,680
excited about in there's all kind of

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,630
recruits to sort of this I'm excited

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,550
about seeing this list machine being

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,530
reinvented but kind of from the ground

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,380
up one of the things that I've noticed

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,340
that's very different these days is

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,890
before the internet everything had to

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,150
come top-down you you couldn't develop a

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,100
new language unless you have the

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,730
resources of a large company that could

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,250
then print the books burn the CDs to you

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,660
know teach people in classes whereas now

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,340
you have like a new programming language

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,690
every week coming out so one of the one

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,580
of the things I think is really exciting

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,700
there's things like serverless a lot of

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,130
people are doing edge edge compute but

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,260
it's really around javascript which is

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,270
kind of like a modern-day Lisp and that

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,980
sounds you know maybe like a heretical

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:16,360
thing to be saying but that's the stuff

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,239
that really excites me there's also a

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,050
new development in package management

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,489
called Nicks

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,670
but it's this idea of being able to

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,620
describe the entire all the resources

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,500
needed for your software in a single

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,030
file which is pretty impressive

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,910
something I haven't seen anywhere in

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:37,140
history and so this idea of being able

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,340
as a developer to just write your entire

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,560
idea from start to finish

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,239
you know you know in just text without

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,200
having to worry about configuration

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,980
management or you know tweaking a server

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,230
getting to the point where you're just

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,610
in front of the computer getting your

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,280
idea out

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,800
that that I find exciting mm-hmm so

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,960
we're at the software architecture

00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,340
conference and it's a big topic and

00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,290
there's a lot of complexity people to

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,660
deal with and stuff sure and we're

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,480
O'Reilly like books what books would you

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,560
recommend for software architects so

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,620
something that I personally found is

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,970
super fulfilling as a software developer

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,579
is and and just a person who's really

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,820
into computers is diving into the

00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,590
history of computers and so in

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,060
particular there's a there's a bunch of

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,770
books but just generally understanding

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,200
where things came from has helped a lot

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,660
because there were these assumptions

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,130
that I took for granted one of which is

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,140
you know whenever you're using a

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,190
computer eventually you're opening up a

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,530
terminal and it's this little tiny

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:42,010
window it's really weird I didn't know

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,970
that that was a teletype and you talked

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,770
to someone who's older and like yeah

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,110
that's a teletype and it explains a lot

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,480
of weird stuff so probably the best book

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,250
and it's so good that actually the

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,380
founders of stripe brought it back out

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,210
of like they started publishing again

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,810
it's a book called the dream machine and

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,210
that covers the invention of the modern

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,350
day computer and it's a really in-depth

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:07,120
treatment and so kind of page page 4

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,130
page pound-for-pound one of the best I

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,870
also really like hackers by Steven Levy

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,640
the other book I like is called where

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,200
Wizards stay up late that's another

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,600
excellent one about the invention of the

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:21,790
internet and it explains why people like

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,620
Vint Cerf are so well regarded and then

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,050
there was one other book that I liked

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,919
but I think those are very very much

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,570
worthwhile so how does by Steven Levy

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:35,860
what wizard stay up late and then

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:37,960
the dream machine great right I think

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,820
history is very important hardly

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,260
anything really new there I don't think

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,190
there's really anything new especially

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:47,850
in computers very few exceptions yeah so

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,910
if you're an architect you work for ACTA

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,490
what should architects know about

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:57,760
authentication and authorization I think

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,760
one of the things that's been helpful to

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,810
me over time especially I've been a

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,210
doctor for four years

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,500
came in didn't really know there was a

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,700
difference between these things it helps

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,800
to understand that a lot of them they're

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:13,440
just concepts it's not like they're like

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,090
a core part of of they're not like like

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,680
axiomatic principles but they're super

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:23,050
useful thinking about how to secure your

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,880
application and so the thing with

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,770
authentication it's it's just very

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,560
useful to think about determining who

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,270
somebody is is is one thing and then

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,820
determining what they have access to is

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,340
another in a similar vein there the

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,970
concept of claims is unreasonably useful

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,310
so this idea that you know just saying

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:44,380
this user I state these certain things

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,750
about them there's all these different

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,490
ways of managing who gets access to what

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,250
and in all the different cases I've seen

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,140
in all the customers I've talked to kind

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,000
of modeling things understanding that

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,770
you've got authentication on the one

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,020
hand authorization on the other and that

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,780
you use claims to state and what's

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,240
important about that user very useful to

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,350
handle all these different use cases so

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,870
there you can describe a little what

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,490
octave does that kind of it's fit and

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,340
the problem it solves for developers

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,690
sure so it's a it sounds a little bit

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,060
you know kind of highfalutin

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,070
I think to say this but at the very core

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,460
what octave does is we connect users

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,830
with services and in a bunch of

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,120
different ways but one of the really

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,620
interesting things to me about this

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,230
personally somebody's into history is

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,330
that this is almost an unbounded problem

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,250
I mean starting from the 70s with

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,520
project Athena at MIT and all the other

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,740
similar projects to today

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,470
none of that's gone away there's people

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,680
still using 1970s era technology in the

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:48,150
form of Kerberos and doing their you

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,190
know security and to you know modern day

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:56,400
stuff like using Open ID Connect and

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:58,500
Olaf to so in in terms of what octave

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,050
does is we kind of help bridge that

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,430
