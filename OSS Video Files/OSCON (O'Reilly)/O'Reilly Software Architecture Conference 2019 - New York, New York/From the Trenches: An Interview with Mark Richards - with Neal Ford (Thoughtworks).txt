	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
I'd have to say the biggest dumpster

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,760
fire was lead architect Jean as a lead

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,110
architect on a very large Honeywell TBM

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,300
conversion and this was converting

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,769
Honeywell assembler to C language and a

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,260
couple of interesting things about that

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,940
this was my first opportunity as an

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,039
application architect and so I led that

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,020
project as an application architect the

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,359
second challenge on this was that we had

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,250
no documentation so we had to reverse

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,970
engineer business rules from Honeywell

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,610
assembler that led the project was a

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,380
huge success we were on time within

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,079
budget and converted all the

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:43,800
functionality okay and what part of that

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:47,399
was a dumpster fire oh yeah yeah good

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,809
point what was the question no actually

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,000
the reason that came to mind when you

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,949
asked the question was because it was a

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,140
success that the project was but the

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,879
dumpster fire actually had nothing to do

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,079
with the technical aspects of that

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,199
project I had to do with the people

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,480
parts mainly me it wasn't one of my

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,500
proudest moments as a software architect

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,810
but essentially I li CIA lien aided

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,090
almost everybody on that project and as

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,939
a matter of fact two people actually

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,840
left the company as a direct result of

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,360
my abrasiveness my lack of leadership my

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,060
lack of coaching mentoring and my lack

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,799
of overall people skills that some

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,659
that's why that came to mind first

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,549
because that was the biggest lesson

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,159
learned I think I ever had in software

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,200
architecture that being a software

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,110
architect has much more than just being

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,759
a great technologist it's also being

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,500
really good at leadership in people

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,159
skills and that really you know what

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,649
Neal I mean that project really did for

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,659
me really define the role of what an

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,130
architect does yeah that actually

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,229
reflects what attrition was talking

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,520
about before we came out so let's go

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,869
more positive and not talk about

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,030
negative things so once the architecture

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,490
you're proud of stuff as you build well

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:05,009
all of them next question the last one

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:08,009
right I'd have to say in 2005 I was

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,940
working with IBM actually I was a on a

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,230
very large insurance company project in

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,819
SOA

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,440
and I did say that was probably my

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,190
proudest architecture now keep in mind

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,290
in 2005 SOA was at the beginning of that

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,530
hype curve and we were just trying to

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,870
figure it out and it was a fantastic

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,590
project I actually felt like I figured

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,950
SOA out service-oriented architecture

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,420
worked on several ESB workflow patterns

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,700
service registry patterns that ended up

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,349
actually with a two patents then I

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,849
received as a result of that project and

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:46,349
that was actually pretty good through

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,000
IBM however I will say there is a lesson

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,250
learn in there as well because while

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,650
that project I was really proud of and

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,150
it was a huge success there was a lesson

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,709
learned that project neil almost failed

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,269
because we didn't take one thing into

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,069
account early enough you see

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,970
service-oriented architecture is all

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:07,530
about services no it's not it's all

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,840
about the data and the data

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,690
consolidation and kind of tearing apart

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,160
and consolidating data something we

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,049
waited too long for that was a key

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,049
lesson learned as a matter of fact I

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,239
know you've quoted this this we've said

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,910
this quote um something comes to mind

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,609
from George George Santayana as a matter

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,560
of fact he said this those who cannot

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:31,139
remember the past are condemned to

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,150
repeat it and think of what we have now

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,910
this big hype curve in micro services

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,819
and as a matter of fact in my travels I

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,459
see the same history being repeated and

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,989
all this focus on services in micro

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,989
services and not enough about the data

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,390
