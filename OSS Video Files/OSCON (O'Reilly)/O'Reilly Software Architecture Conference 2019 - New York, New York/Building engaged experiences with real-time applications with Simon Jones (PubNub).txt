hi I'm Roger McGough let's

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,290
vice-president of radar at O'Reilly I'm

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,859
here at the software architecture

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,320
conference in New York for 2019 I'm here

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,490
with Simon Jones who is the VP of

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,120
Marketing for PubNub is pub now tell us

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,100
about it

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,859
tell us what you guys do well thanks for

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,689
inviting me pub nub is a company that

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,170
helps customers to build real time

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,510
applications so think chat device

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,090
control in the world of IOT of those

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,450
little cars that run around on maps for

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,450
right share things like that we've been

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,850
around for about ten years and you know

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,120
the way we see it is our customers are

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,100
really changing products changing

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,070
industries changing human experience

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,379
with the intelligent application of real

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,300
time right so it's kind of that's kind

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,860
of a fancy thing you expect a marketing

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,739
guy to say so let me put a little bit of

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,230
meat on the bones if you think about the

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,140
ways that technology have really changed

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,120
the way that we live as often as not it

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,640
turns out to be through real time

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,170
infrastructure right so you and I both

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,780
have spent a long time in the Bay Area

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,540
we remember when ride-sharing started

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,400
and when you cut away all of the

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,860
nonsense of the marketing what really

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,380
mattered was somebody who needed a ride

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,700
could find somebody who wanted to give

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,740
them a ride right here in the back of

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,130
the 90s you couldn't get a taxi for love

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,890
no money and so it's that sort of thing

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,979
that changes things similarly we see in

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,110
the world for instance of exercise right

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,759
most people have seen peloton on the

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,820
television these these fantastic

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,439
exercise bikes that don't collect dust

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,750
in your garage and the reason they don't

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,210
is because of a big screen and you can

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,299
join a real spinning class in New York

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,899
in LA or whatever and what makes it work

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,090
is that the bicycle sends readings from

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,310
its sensors back into Central and you

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,020
can see how you're doing on screen the

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,820
instructor can see what you're doing the

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,360
instructor can send you a high-five and

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,600
so this whole industry of home exercise

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,950
has changed and we're seeing this across

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,090
industries all across the world and

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,550
we're bringing people closer together

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,340
given the opportunity to see what's

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,110
happening right

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,150
it happens and this is really exciting

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,819
things happening right now okay

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,269
you gave the example of a pollutant or

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,420
peloton yeah any other examples that

00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:28,120
worth getting a little more detail on

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,400
sure so one of the things that's been

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,989
really interesting recently is working

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,510
with companies who run let's call it

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,610
sort of user-generated video it's

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,599
slightly above user generated video the

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,879
sort of stuff that isn't on the

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,069
television but is really capturing most

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,840
of the eyeballs today you look at

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,319
companies like like roosterteeth for

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,319
instance or twitch right where people

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,810
film themselves while they are doing

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,069
something whether it's making a show or

00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,930
whether it's just playing a game or

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,549
these days actually developing

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,349
apparently this is the new thing you can

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:06,040
sit and watch a developer develop in

00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:08,430
real time at too old for that but what's

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,680
happening is these environments are

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,459
coming back around to the concept of

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,130
social interaction during the viewing

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:20,530
and today's real time application allows

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,079
them to build really engaging

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,850
experiences so it's not how it used to

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,310
be we just sort of tippity-tap some

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,500
stuff in and there it is they're

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,389
inventing their own languages they're

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,730
inventing their own patois so you can

00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,430
use different switches to change how

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,920
things happen they're embedding emojis

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,959
embedding you know pictures that sort of

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,630
thing and what's happening now is if you

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,889
look at the world of kind of the younger

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,989
viewer people aren't necessarily tapping

00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:53,079
up on Thursday evening to watch friends

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,750
they're cracking into the latest content

00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,790
from influences they're interested in

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,750
and communities are building up around

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:04,239
them and so as we look forward you know

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,810
it turns out that what you used to be

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,730
the one directional experience of

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,769
watching watching video was becoming the

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,819
building of community and we're working

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,940
with a number of really interesting

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,260
companies who are who are leveraging

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,229
that in making something where a

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,669
community can sustain itself and really

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:22,760
become something that's going to go

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:25,180
offline

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,920
the other thing we see by the way is

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,480
folks who build apps write apps that

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,640
have communities to them right so

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,850
whether it's I don't know going to a

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,270
place to to meet sort of the Airbnb

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:41,090
meets couchsurfing type thing or even

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,340
the delivery companies what they're

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,790
saying is that yes it works for sort of

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,130
a specific outcome right so if you call

00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,420
a food delivery yes okay it drops you

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,480
some food

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,800
but what consumers want today is to be

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,270
able to have a community but they want

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,910
to be able to communicate in real-time

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,370
and a lot of our customers are telling

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,800
us well it's great and all but people

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,170
keep dropping out of my app and getting

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,710
into a whatsapp or something along those

00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,050
lines

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,650
we now want that experience to be inside

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,930
so once again community forms around the

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,880
services that are being produced so you

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,770
know when I say we're we're helping

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,810
people to change products industries and

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,030
human experience

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,160
sure it's a little bit a little bit

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,660
poetic a little bit our aspirational but

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,070
what I see out in the marketplace is

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,240
that's genuinely what's happening that

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,000
sounds great

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,340
what what do you get when you get PubNub

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,720
like weird where does their service

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,960
begin and end that's a wonderful

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,800
question so what we provide is a series

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,090
of api's the lay to build the

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,940
applications very quickly and obviously

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,290
with the amount of SDKs we deliver you

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,640
can write to pretty much any device

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,650
known to man those api s-- then push the

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,230
messages into our data stream network

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,330
and the data stream network sort of the

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,130
short version of it is that it's a

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,660
global pubsub network and it has a

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,210
really sophisticated orchestration layer

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,280
that connects all the pops that we have

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,650
around the world the reason that's

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,420
important is that when you post a

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,850
message into the data stream you're

00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,890
guaranteed that anybody anywhere in the

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,900
world can grab that within a quarter of

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,730
a second our actual latency czar much

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,730
lower but you know always always do

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,680
better than you promised right and so

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,630
really what what happens is if you're

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,640
building a teeny tiny little real-time

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,920
app a chat for 20 people who are gonna

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,599
talk about beanie babies or somesuch

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,939
it's not

00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,860
wildly difficult to build you drop a

00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:42,649
socket IO service somewhere and start

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,779
coding as your audience gets a larger

00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,969
and more geographically distributed

00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,909
building infrastructure to support it

00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:53,119
turns out to be really complicated

00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:55,639
finicky and takes a lot of time to keep

00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:58,339
running effectively so folks really look

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,689
to us when they're looking for speed

00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:06,050
reliability and scale frankly today we

00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:09,139
send twice as many messages per day as

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,779
snapchat Twitter and the global SMS

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,749
system combined so we haven't yet come

00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:16,520
across anybody who's going to blow us up

00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:18,770
with the scale they bring I hope to that

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,180
would be very exciting but really those

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,059
are the those are the pieces that really

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,559
drive people to use public and we're

00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:28,249
kind of heading in the future what kind

00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:30,349
of technologies and it's a great

00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:32,749
question you know the reality is that

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,539
we're driven to a lunch degree by what

00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:37,699
our customers are trying to do many of

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:41,389
our customers today a building chat and

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:45,430
making that chat for more expensive so

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:48,050
for instance we built into our system a

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,689
service capability so you can build

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,729
functions into the network and so

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,159
they're now connecting to other micro

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:57,529
services right so for instance you could

00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,149
have two people having a chat one only

00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:02,029
speaks English one only speaks Spanish

00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:03,919
you can build functions into the network

00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,829
so that as each message hits it's

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,740
quickly passed against say an Amazon or

00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:12,259
an IBM translation machine and then

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,550
passed straight on so without losing

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,829
more than one hundred hundred fifty

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,389
milliseconds one speaking Spanish one

00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,029
speaking English nobody knows the

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,999
difference so that's fantastic and

00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:25,309
really the essence of what we do is to

00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:27,589
deliver api's that are extensible so

00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:29,809
people are building innovative apps

00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:32,120
rather than thinking about just like how

00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:34,590
do I make the service work but I do

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,130
think going forward

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:41,190
the ability to share these streams of

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:44,039
data very quickly very reliably is

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,900
moving us in the direction of the

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,790
event-driven architecture space which I

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,820
think is really just forming I think you

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,410
can say event-driven and everybody nods

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,230
and then you scratch the surface and

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,630
they start looking uncomfortable but as

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,029
we look at the way in which apps are

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:04,320
increasingly loosely or even not really

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:06,300
coupled and need better and better ways

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,279
to communicate across themselves we're

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,420
now starting to see folks architecting

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:15,839
really interesting ways to use both the

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,460
the live connection to connect apps that

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,589
may be running in wildly different

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,630
places and then using our history and

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,339
playback capabilities to make sure that

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,529
if they don't want to get everything

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,860
right at the second that they can hook

00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,600
back in and pole at a rate that is

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,510
comfortable for their application and

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,250
pull backs with chunks of data so I

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,510
really think that over the next 24

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,660
months we'll be seeing a lot more

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,400
activity in that space as we all as an

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,440
industry get a little bit more more sort

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,820
of comfortable with it

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,200
fascinating the public a lot of topics

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,670
here today thanks for spending time with

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,670
