hi I'm Roger McGough 'less VP of radar

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,540
and O'Reilly and I'm here at the

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,970
software architecture conference in New

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,469
York City for 2019 and I'm here with

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,179
rich Graham who's the director of sales

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,160
at white source software

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,060
welcome rich hey Roger how are you good

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,250
so white source they're do open source

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,630
security and management software you

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,090
know what does that mean what kind of

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,800
areas you focus on yeah sure it's oh

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,349
yeah we like to say we help our

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,679
customers harness the power of using

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,420
open source and by that I mean

00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,350
identifying all of the elements of open

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,270
source that they use in their

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,820
development process and then also

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,610
identifying the risk associated with

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,200
using open source the challenge is you

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,420
know of course you need to move faster

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,120
and get to market with better services

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,829
and applications and offerings so

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,710
increasingly organizations are moving to

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,140
using open source in that development so

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,760
this is this is of course presents a

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,829
tremendous opportunity for them to move

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,480
faster but it also presents some risk

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,949
right so the challenge is really getting

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,170
you know understanding what you're using

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,570
and then identifying the risk and how to

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,340
remediate that risk mm-hmm so what's

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,930
going on in the market I mean are you

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,520
getting any resistance on the open

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,869
source front or is that like a real

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,150
positive yeah so the market that we we

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,979
play in is called software composition

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,110
analysis really it's kind of an

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,479
intersection between InfoSec traditional

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,340
InfoSec and DevOps or devstack ops which

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,780
I think has rather been aptly termed one

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,939
of the terms I like yeah it is a good

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,740
term yeah and and I think we're in a

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,200
sort of an inflection point where we've

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,090
we've we've been working with what you'd

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,829
call the early adopters in the market

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,500
and we're transitioning now into the

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,689
mainstream or early mainstream and so

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,820
you know I think it's analogous to to

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,549
the cloud where a lot of organizations

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,799
today are taking a cloud first approach

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,420
to their architecture we're seeing in

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,990
development most organizations are

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,790
taking an open-source first approach and

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,549
then so you know you look at a typical

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,770
application today you know typical

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,659
commercial application the overwhelming

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,399
majority of that code consists of open

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,290
source as opposed to proprietary

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,140
in-house code you know if you kind of

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,570
you know rwan

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,630
ten years ago it was the polar opposite

00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,670
so people are using open-source and need

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,100
a way to kind of have a governance model

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,080
to support all the integrations all the

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,760
languages and you know that are that are

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,960
they're using today but of course you

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,090
know what's coming in the future as well

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,370
that's great we noticed the same thing

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,560
on our platform so that there's

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,500
definitely a thing towards the cloud and

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,640
towards open-source so growth and shift

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,070
in the market what do you think is

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,630
coming next yeah I mean that's that's a

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,950
great question and it's something we're

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,230
always trying to you know keep our ear

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,850
to the street about kind of what's you

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,709
know what our customers are asking and I

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,330
mentioned we've been very fortunate at

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,459
white source to work with a lot of the

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,470
early adopters in the market and they're

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,860
driving a lot of the innovation that

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,060
that that's that's you know taking place

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,130
we like to think of it as white source

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,270
everywhere so you can invoke white

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,660
source you know right through the

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,940
browser tools for developers that enable

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,890
them to vet open source before bring it

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,489
you know before even bringing components

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,410
in-house

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,640
it's the best way to shift left is not

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,280
even to bring in those questionable

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,650
components you know the concept of

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,239
effective usage or or am i affected by

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,370
security vulnerabilities so at white

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,459
source we have what's called prioritize

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,019
so not only do we bring the the alerts

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,910
and the inventory of the open source

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,890
that you're using will actually show you

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,570
in your application code where you're

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,400
calling out to a vulnerable open source

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,620
component so that you can prioritize

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,850
your remediation in addition to this

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,260
will show you where you're not calling

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,459
that component right which is even

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,019
better so if you have a green shield

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,330
within the UI you know I'm not affected

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,350
by that security vulnerability we found

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,640
that about 70% seven zero of the

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,410
security vulnerabilities that show up in

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,170
an inventory you're not actually calling

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,430
right so you've pulled in the library

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,200
but you're not meant necessarily calling

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,180
that vulnerability so kind of bringing

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,709
that level of granularity to to the

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,350
remediation process is really a game

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,910
changer and really just you know like I

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,620
mentioned DevOps and kind of integrating

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,959
with the DevOps tool chain everything

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,130
needs to be consumable through api's so

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
anything you can do in white source you

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,989
can do programmatically through our API

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,450
I mean I can go on of course because the

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,950
market is really exploding I said one of

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,100
the last pieces I'll mention is you know

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,810
serverless we just we just know launch

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,579
support for supporting service

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,440
architectures and it's pretty funny you

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,729
know a few years ago I remember I'm

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,139
sitting with my customers on a white

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,810
board and kind of conceptualizing

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,830
containers and conceptualizing

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,600
serverless architecture when it came out

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,070
and you know fast forward a couple years

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,260
later I actually have customers who are

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,540
deployed with complete serverless

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,160
architectures containerized

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,930
architectures and they're actually

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,669
monitoring and managing you know that in

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,960
real time that's really great to hear

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,600
it's something that we're tracking as

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,010
well I think server lists it feels a

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,289
little mature still I don't know if you

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,789
think so as well but it's definitely

00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,650
something a lot of people are talking

00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:55,990
about these days yeah I was at a

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,699
conference just two weeks ago and it was

00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,289
with the startup startup type company

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,380
but his entire infrastructure is is

00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:03,639
based on Cerberus interesting right even

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,169
in production when I see when I kind of

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,900
gasp and look that he says I get that

00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:10,090
reaction a lot right so it's it's sort

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,070
of the the legacy companies that need to

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,330
keep this sort of at the forefront of

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,560
their minds and they they're they're

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,450
competing with the startup to the world

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,190
that can that can start off with that

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,450
architecture and inversion place is

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,070
there anything else you want to share

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,150
about how customers are implementing

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,400
lightsource

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,340
sure yeah that's a great question so

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,560
most of our customers will implement the

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,750
technology as a part of their CI CD

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,550
pipeline and it's one of the value props

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,930
for using white sources we want you to

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,940
use the tool right some of the code

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,580
scanning technologies have gotten a bit

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,560
of a you know a bad name if you will for

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,340
becoming a bottleneck for development so

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,720
a white source

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,240
you know we encourage our customers to

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,560
integrate with the CI pipeline and we

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
have customers literally they have four

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,340
hundred five hundred thousand jobs

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,810
configured leveraging white source and

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,930
every time they run a build a run white

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,400
source in parallel also talked about you

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,270
know implementation I have a large

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,740
customer a bank financial customer that

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,090
that doesn't even log into the UI right

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,229
I mentioned anything you can do in white

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,240
source you could do programmatically

00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,370
through our REST API s so they'll use

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,289
white sources api's and pull that data

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,490
as part of their broader risk management

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:15,550
platform I think that's an interesting

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,320
use case but it's you know I'm forever

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,139
surprised it's a very flexible

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,580
technology and I learn more

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,919
from the customers of how they're using

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,150
our technology and then and they kind of

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,099
tell us how they're using it and we kind

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,080
of you know kind of build use cases for

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,090
future around that there are certainly

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,610
some standard use cases for you know how

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,349
how customers like I said the idea is to

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,840
continually and automatically monitor

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:39,599
your open source and your risk so see

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,009
ICD is usually a good place to start but

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,870
our customers are always keeping us on

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,870
our toes mmm-hmm what is it kind of

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,259
share between your your GUI and the API

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,289
usage would you say so you know I think

00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,610
most customers will have a it's a great

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,300
question actually I never really thought

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,699
about it

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,620
most of our customers will use the API

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,229
for some integration points when they

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,110
want to pull some data however they'll

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:05,789
also use the UI that the use case I

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,050
mentioned I think is rare most folks

00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,000
will have access to the UI

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,310
there's also workflows you can create

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,439
inside of work inside of white source so

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,909
these are you know policies we call them

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,789
or custom workflows where you can bring

00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:19,830
in human intervention you can create you

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,870
know assignments for perhaps even a

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,479
legal person to get you know to look at

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,069
something that popped up in the code and

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,599
then kind of sign off on it or it can go

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,229
as far as breaking a bill based on that

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,180
information

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:33,210
so those users of course would need

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,189
access to the to the portal UI mm-hmm so

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,649
given where you're at how do you plan on

00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,819
like positioning light source and take

00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,349
advantage of what's going on in the

00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,050
market and for the growth that we're

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,180
seeing yeah so you know I mentioned

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,919
we're kind of phasing into the into more

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,349
of the mainstream market I've seen

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,240
various numbers out there 200 million

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,819
pluses for is sort of the current market

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,129
value and that's projected to go up 8 to

00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,589
10 X in the next few years right so

00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,000
there's a lot of growth in this market

00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,779
people are they're starting to

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,460
understand that what the challenge is

00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:06,990
Equifax brought some attention to us

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,129
with the with that you know breach that

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,240
happened through another open source

00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,949
framework

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,349
so now you know organizations are

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,509
realizing that we need to have robust

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:18,029
governance models in place we need to

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,919
provide the tools for our developers to

00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,169
use open source effectively and

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,560
capitalize on that you know on that

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,580
opportunity so really it the future

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,230
looks very very bright

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,780
we just took another

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,210
of investment of 35 million so I think

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,160
right now we're around 150 ish employees

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,020
total by this time next year perhaps

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,750
when we sit down again the goal is to be

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,490
around 300 great this is really pretty

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,960
interesting great fit for our conference

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,460
thanks again for your time

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,700
yeah thanks Roger it was a thanks for

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,700
