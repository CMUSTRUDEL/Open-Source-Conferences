hi I'm Roger McGough vice-president of

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,549
radar to Riley and I'm here at the

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,680
software architecture conference in New

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,900
York City 2019

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm here with Kurt Monet who is the

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,639
director of customer solutions and

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,690
success at progress software welcome

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,580
thanks for having me

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,330
so progress software has always been

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,680
involved in tools for developers what

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,180
are some of the areas are focused on oh

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,980
yeah so we've been around for about

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,260
about 30 years working on developer

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,210
tools today we're really focused on a

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,529
couple of the the challenges that we're

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,570
seeing in the in the market that

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,550
companies are having do going through

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,860
digital transformation it's pretty

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,329
difficult to become a technology company

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,000
which many companies are having to

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,860
become today and we also find that that

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,570
companies tend to have really large IT

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,850
backlogs right they have a lot of demand

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,100
from the business for applications and

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,539
so we're focused on building tools that

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,399
are helping companies go through that

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,690
digital transformation successfully and

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,969
helping their developers be more

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,500
productive great so we know lots of

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,289
companies are struggling with this as

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,120
you said and they have you know opt-out

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,350
backlogs and this the transformation

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,939
itself is difficult they've got

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,250
migration what do you think the key

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,930
challenges are holding them back and so

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,729
there's there's two big challenges that

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,130
that we see pretty consistently across

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,590
the industry one of those challenges is

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,020
that to build modern digital experiences

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,490
that businesses want especially

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,320
differentiated experiences that are

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,500
going to add business value companies

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,299
need to be able to extend their legacy

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,180
systems that they have in place right

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,460
these could be on-premise systems that

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,159
have been within a company for 30 years

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,540
or they could be third party cloud

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,799
systems and really have to kind of

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,810
expose all these and tie them all

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,939
together to build net new digital

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,390
experiences whether that's a mobile

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,700
application or a wearable or a chatbot

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,829
or IOT device and so that that could be

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,869
very challenging tying these modern

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,640
requirements into these these legacy

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,579
systems that are aren't necessarily

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,560
designed to meet the challenges and the

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,020
the format and the load that that these

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,280
digital experiences demand the other

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,979
thing that that we see pretty

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,890
consistently is that companies struggle

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,989
with their development resources right

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,970
when you talk about a modern digital

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,100
experience at my

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,440
an iOS application an Android

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,600
application a web application and

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,430
companies have a hard time hiring the

00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,560
developers that they need to build all

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,180
of those all those applications and all

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,370
those different frameworks with a lot of

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,700
different skill sets and so what we've

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,920
tried to do is build a platform that is

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,950
gonna make it easy for companies to use

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,020
a single single codebase single

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,910
framework a core end-to-end across their

00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,130
entire development stack and really make

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,500
their team's more efficient mm-hmm so it

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,200
sounds like it's kind of a small bit of

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,700
code to get a lot done how does you know

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,740
how do you compare to other low code and

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,850
no code platforms yes so there's other

00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,040
there's other companies that have

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,700
attempted to focus on developer

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,350
productivity as well and they've tend to

00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,000
take an approach of you know let's let's

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,709
make it easy to build simple business

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,260
applications right drag-and-drop some

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,150
fields and and put together put together

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,540
and happen and those can be great for

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,070
pretty simple apps that you know maybe

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,650
need to expose a few fields in a forum

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,040
or whatever but those those platforms

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,730
tend to be very limiting as well

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,739
developers don't really like them

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,300
they're usually very proprietary and

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,680
they have a lot of lock-in as well right

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,780
so you're you're you're developing an

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,540
app but you're you know locked into a

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,060
particular framework and if you need to

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,880
go beyond the simple requirements and

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,830
build a truly differentiated mission

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,470
critical application you just can't do

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,090
it and so so the way our platform is

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,110
different is is we've really focused on

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,450
those mission-critical applications

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,950
we're trying to deliver the high

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,380
productivity but also give developers

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,610
the control that they want and so what

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,870
we've done is we built a Cerberus

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,209
back-end that has all the different

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,830
components that you need for a modern

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,310
digital experience whether that's a

00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,200
datastore a serverless place to deploy

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,760
business logic

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,480
integration capabilities into back-end

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,540
systems chatbots AI that's all part of

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,920
our service back-end that we provide and

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,270
it's all done in standard frame rest

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,490
developers like right we have we've

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,680
JavaScript and and so if you're a web

00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,540
developer you don't need to learn

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,760
anything else you're using the standards

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,079
that you know to build your applications

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,220
and it's not just on the backend right

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,460
we've done the same thing on the front

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,540
end as well so we've we've put in place

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,010
we have a tool called native script

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,350
that's part of our platform which

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,060
delivers cross-platform applications

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,030
using angular which is a flavor of

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,190
JavaScript and then you can also share

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,660
code with web applications as well and

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,380
we've we have a tool called convey

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,790
studio that allows you to actually build

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,950
those applications in a drag-and-drop

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,290
way but not be locked in right so

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,180
instead of instead of building your app

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,740
and then having to always remain in this

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,970
drag-and-drop environment you can

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,080
actually drag and drop and build your

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,940
app but then when you need to get out

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,620
and go do something custom you actually

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,419
have well-formed app code that you can

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,610
take in to whatever you want that's

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,530
great but you provided an example of

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,419
someone who's going through digital

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,310
transformation with your tools yes so

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,020
and one of our one of our successful

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,460
customers in the healthcare space we

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,220
have a lot of a lot of healthcare

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,840
customers actually compliance is another

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,560
big thing that the platform provides and

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,539
so that a year and a half two years ago

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,760
a new customer called canopy health and

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,729
canopy health is a accountable care

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,370
organization they were formed by the

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,770
UCSF Hospital and John where health out

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,450
in the Bay Area and they had to very

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,610
quickly build a really complex

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,830
application for connecting patients and

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,410
doctors the application needed to

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,479
integrate with EHR data which can be

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,030
very complex in and of itself with CRM

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,130
data we needed to have that new data

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,810
needed to be on web on iOS on Android

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,400
and so by using a end end javascript

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,810
framework to build this application and

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,030
some of the Cerberus capabilities that

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,860
our platform provided they were actually

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,710
able to release an MVP version of their

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,419
app within 90 days and went fully live

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,100
in production within nine months for

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,289
this extremely complex application of

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,539
course that makes a the the stakeholders

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,039
on the business very happy to see that

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,990
that level of productivity

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,360
iemon also allows them to be very agile

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,370
right they have two weeks prints for we

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,229
release cycles and so they can quickly

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,300
incorporate user feedback and make their

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,800
app better and better and just make it

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,259
very engaging for their users

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,800
sounds great well thanks for your time

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,300
today

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,300
