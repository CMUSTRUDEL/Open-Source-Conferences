Title: Open source and open standards in VR - Stephanie Hurlburt (Binomial)
Publication date: 2017-05-11
Playlist: OSCON 2017 - Austin, Texas
Description: 
	New hardware, tools, and engine technologies are emerging in the exciting space of VR, but open source and open standards will be what makes VR a lasting ecosystem. Stephanie Hurlburt explains why an open ecosystem not only helps content creators thrive but is essential for the ecosystem’s survival. It allows developers to more easily keep up with the rapid pace of VR developments and platform support and promotes a less fractured ecosystem. It helps educate the community and bring new developers into VR. Most importantly, it fosters an accessible development environment for everyone. For VR to truly succeed, we need quality VR content; the more open work we support, the more quality content we’ll see.

so I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,300
some open-source VR experiences and

00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,950
different open source libraries that are

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,780
out there in the VR community

00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,050
the first one is pretty amazing it's

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,590
called Janus VR it is seeking to be the

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,560
web but in virtual reality

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,670
[Applause]

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,670
[Music]

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:37,819
[Music]

00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:52,070

[Music]

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,930
so that's one open-source project

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,860
yeah those those folks are pretty

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,050
amazing we're seeing a few really

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,350
powerful experiences in VR already

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,900
actually a lot the two I keep an eye on

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,230
a lot our social VR and the world of the

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,600
art art experiences in be our social vr

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,130
is especially powerful I mean think

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,690
about texts compared to phone which you

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,519
get a little more nuanced compared to

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,530
Skype in virtual reality you can

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,280
actually see people's body movements see

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,980
their faces

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,810
it's incredible to be able to connect

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,209
with people all around the world through

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,100
virtual reality and I'm very excited

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,260
that important experiences like Janis

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,120
are open source you should also check

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,140
out things like high fidelity which is

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,430
incredible

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,430
