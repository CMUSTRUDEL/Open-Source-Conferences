Description: 
	New hardware, tools, and engine technologies are emerging in the exciting space of VR, but open source and open standards will be what makes VR a lasting ecosystem. Stephanie Hurlburt explains why an open ecosystem not only helps content creators thrive but is essential for the ecosystem’s survival. It allows developers to more easily keep up with the rapid pace of VR developments and platform support and promotes a less fractured ecosystem. It helps educate the community and bring new developers into VR. Most importantly, it fosters an accessible development environment for everyone. For VR to truly succeed, we need quality VR content; the more open work we support, the more quality content we’ll see.
