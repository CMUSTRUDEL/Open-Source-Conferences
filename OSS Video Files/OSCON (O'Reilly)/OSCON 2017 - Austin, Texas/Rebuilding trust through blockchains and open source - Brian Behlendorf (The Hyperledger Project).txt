	Brian Behlendorf (The Hyperledger Project at the Linux Foundation)

Global confidence in institutions from politics to businesses to schools and nonprofits is in steep decline worldwide. Technology frequently lets us down too—in everything from AWS outages to surveillance teddy bears. Brian Behlendorf explains why trust is essential to building a functioning society and how it’s under serious threat. Brian argues that open source software offers a model for how we can work together, even when we have no reason to trust each other. Blockchain technology (distributed ledgers, smart contract systems, and more) take this a step further, helping us build distributed systems without requiring a controlling central actor. Brian discusses what this means for developers and how to get started.
