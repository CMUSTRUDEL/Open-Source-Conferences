Title: Rebuilding trust through blockchains and open source - Brian Behlendorf (The Hyperledger Project)
Publication date: 2017-05-10
Playlist: OSCON 2017 - Austin, Texas
Description: 
	Brian Behlendorf (The Hyperledger Project at the Linux Foundation)

Global confidence in institutions from politics to businesses to schools and nonprofits is in steep decline worldwide. Technology frequently lets us down too—in everything from AWS outages to surveillance teddy bears. Brian Behlendorf explains why trust is essential to building a functioning society and how it’s under serious threat. Brian argues that open source software offers a model for how we can work together, even when we have no reason to trust each other. Blockchain technology (distributed ledgers, smart contract systems, and more) take this a step further, helping us build distributed systems without requiring a controlling central actor. Brian discusses what this means for developers and how to get started.

	00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,310
this is something that now is as

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,400
exciting for me and I think for a lot of

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,799
people as the early days of the web and

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,509
that is blockchain technology and I mean

00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:14,490
you've all heard kind of a Bitcoin hype

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,100
especially with the price where it is

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,110
now like $12,000 a Bitcoin something

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,890
like that and aetherium and things like

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,690
that

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,150
but what is getting a lot of people

00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,850
excited is actually the data structure

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,710
and the technology underneath not just

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,590
crypto currencies but lots of other

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,170
potential applications for for this new

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,510
this new kind of thing called a

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,149
distributed ledger right so what is a

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,949
distributed ledger some people say well

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,890
it's just a form of distributed database

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:45,420
right but it's very different than the

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,210
kinds of databases that we know about

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,399
today all right it's a database that can

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,350
be run by multiple different parties it

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,300
could be run by a group of us here in

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,699
this room it could be run by everybody

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,670
on the whole wide internet but what it

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,949
essentially is is a write only log write

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,050
only ledger of transactions that we

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,090
record and everybody gets a copy of and

00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,700
everybody knows the exact order that

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,320
these things are in and we can use it to

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,910
record promises that we make to each

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,740
other or trades that we do with each

00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,900
other or simply things that we want

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,020
never to disappear right and never to be

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,130
in dispute and this on the basis of this

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,020
I mean

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,420
double entry accounting is what helped

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,790
us build modern society in a way right

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,890
and this in a way is not just double

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,900
entry accounting it's n entry accounting

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,630
where n is as large as the networks that

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,640
we pulled together and in order to make

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,620
this actually trustworthy and verifiable

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,200
we need to know that each entry in this

00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,970
ledger is in a specific order and it's

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,010
cryptographically connected to the to

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,930
the entries before right and that's

00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,420
called a Merkel tree had some really fun

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,510
stuff but it's at its core pretty basic

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,890
right and what was fascinating for me

00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,870
and the reason why I jumped into this

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,950
almost exactly a year ago and why I

00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,080
think a lot of others are getting

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,480
interested is this doesn't require a

00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,950
cryptocurrency to work all right there

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,110
are things that are possible when you

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,460
add a cryptocurrency to it when you want

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,200
to do things at the scale of the whole

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,330
wide internet then it becomes very

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,039
useful but for a lot of different kinds

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,719
of applications all you really want to

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,939
do is pull together a set of

00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,580
participants in an ecosystem make sure

00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,200
you could always

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,150
and more right make sure that those

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,230
boundaries are fairly flexible but

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,510
there's a lot of different applications

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,870
and to brunt go very quickly through

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,030
them there's a company called CLS Bank

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,670
that's using stuff from the hyper ledger

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,370
project a project called fabric to

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,870
implement a core net settlement system

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,670
between the major central banks of the

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,530
world this is a company most of you have

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,540
probably never heard of but they handle

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,820
five trillion dollars a day of

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,380
instruments of basically financial

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,120
instruments between these big central

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,860
banks and they'll be building the

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,040
settlement system for that on top of

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,980
hyper ledger fabric a Walmart and IBM

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,810
are working in China to bring

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,570
distributed ledger to trace the supply

00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,760
chain for pork products so that when

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,500
there's a foodborne illness or when

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,090
there's questions about where did this

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,610
meat come from they're able to trace

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,130
exactly back to the source in a way that

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,430
is not you know everybody implementing

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,670
to the Walmart API or to the IBM API but

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,680
instead to an industry-wide API the

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,540
healthcare industry is really interested

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,070
in blockchain applications because it's

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,380
a chance to reinvent what has always

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,940
been a very thorny problem which is how

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,920
do we share medical records between

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,980
organizations and make them as easy to

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,350
send back and forth as email without it

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,540
turning into gmail without you know if

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,430
setting up one big central repository of

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,530
health information that would be either

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,750
vulnerable to hackers or vulnerable to

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,330
one company kind of controlling that

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,160
that data set right and it's also

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,780
reinventing a lot of how the energy

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,450
markets are starting to think about

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,030
distributed generation trading of carbon

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,130
credits and this as have you've probably

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,290
seen from some of these examples is not

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,600
just a US or Western Europe phenomenon

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,310
this is something where these

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,170
technologies can build these global

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,120
supply chains these global projects and

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,630
there are global participants in these

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,630
