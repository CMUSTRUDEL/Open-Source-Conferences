hi this is like Hendrix

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,000
Texas I'm here with sahih de and Adrian

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,119
from

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,279
AWS yeah yes how are you - doing great

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,170
yeah great to be here good event so far

00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,990
and you guys are going to be talking

00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,240
tomorrow on a couple subjects

00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,939
yeah yeah I'm doing a keynote which is

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,130
Cole we do people and it's about the

00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:33,180
people of open source and then Adrian

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,250
speaking a magnetar I'm talking about

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,080
AWS AI and the Apache onyx net project

00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:45,130
excellent so what is aw AWS up to in an

00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,930
open-source world well where we've been

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,780
contributing back to open source for

00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,239
quite a long time but we haven't had the

00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,070
bandwidth or the Charter in the existing

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,730
engineering teams to go out and tell the

00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,489
story so one thing is for us to just

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,200
that this is a new team to tell to go

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,030
back a little bit more I joined a table

00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,580
just about six months ago on one of the

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,320
things that I cake toppers let's go

00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,259
build an open-source team to engage with

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,320
the ecosystems and for the last few

00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,880
years I've come to work on and I met the

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,010
heater a few years ago and we'd meet up

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,280
out come and talk about all the things

00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,390
that needed doing in the world and I

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,210
persuaded her that this was a great

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,460
thing to go into so as he was building a

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,500
team for me around open-source and we're

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,600
the kind of the outbound engagement lead

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,780
ecosystems and developers and

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,390
communities team that that's our basic

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,610
chatter within a tab us and we're

00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,829
stuffing up right now basically in

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,229
listening mode at this all Scott so it

00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:49,560
turned out and we want to find out what

00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:51,909
people want to do yeah and that's um

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,520
because that's kind of something we have

00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,950
been doing we have been talking about

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,530
what we've been doing in open source our

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,300
developers have been contributing

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,600
and we've been submitting bug fixes

00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:08,190
patches and some large contributions of

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,940
code as well like photo and fans and our

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,770
goal is to let everybody know what we're

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,780
doing but also work with the communities

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,330
work with the foundations and the open

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,300
source projects and help our engineers

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,000
connect with the communities as well so

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,150
we can collaborate and so this is kind

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,830
of a new thing for AWS to actually talk

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,560
a little bit about what you're doing and

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,350
how your ears may need to have this team

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,060
that's the focusing on engaging with the

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,370
communities so that's that's what's

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,110
means the the engagement with open

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,270
source we think there should be more

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,000
than we're encouraging the teams to do

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,640
more but I think it's been growing over

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,870
the last few years and finally reached

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,150
the level where we said somebody needs

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,300
just a little focus on that on getting

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,830
this the story told so this is something

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,050
that's been happening for a while but

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,810
it's now reached a point where you want

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,420
to put some intention into it yeah and

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,970
we've been contributing since 2005 from

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,420
contributing patches and fixes our code

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,970
but a lot of our you know a lot of the

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,820
engagement also involves all of our dev

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,739
community and really actively working

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,480
with open source communities and

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,519
collaborating so that's going to be a

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,320
huge part of our focus and so you have

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,549
some stuff also for nonprofits or

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,940
credits and things like that that you

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:29,549
can you can help some people - yes the

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,560
things like the Postgres does run by a

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,310
non-profit foundation and we contribute

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,110
to them they run testing on AWS so we

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,140
have one accredit for the testing and

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,610
we've built products around Postgres all

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,420
right so it's partly getting back to the

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:49,470
community as we use them as a an open

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,600
standard sequel standard for our key

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,760
database products so it's a good healthy

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,970
ecosystem now yeah yeah and contributing

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,550
back into

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,410
we're taking we're getting value from it

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,120
and we're helping we're fixing and

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,250
patches and all those things go in and

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,080
then we get to make it easy to consume

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,790
so more and more people use postcards

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,470
because it's just trippingly available

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,750
to service rather than having to stand

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,570
it up and go to energy yourself yeah and

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,580
the credit has been programmers been

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,370
running for a while what we want to do

00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,780
is take that and reshape it and one of

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,060
the things we're looking at OSCON is

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,010
input from the community on what they'd

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,440
like to see and how we should shape a

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,250
program like that so how did he tell you

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,790
how do I do yes we have a boss at 7

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:37,080
o'clock today and we also have a lounge

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:41,190
down in the exhibit hall con and and

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:45,640
we've just launched twitter handle at

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,180
AWS open okay so the add sign AWS open

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,550
yeah

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,960
and it's going to be open source open

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,300
data open standards

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,130
so we've before rather than just making

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,730
it open source we can make it a little

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,919
bit more shorter and a little bit more

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,450
broader scope so those those are things

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,330
we have a pretty good open data program

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,790
we host like a continuous live feed of

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,090
Landsat images and a number of other

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,910
government or inter datasets that are

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,980
just there on if you go to the AWS site

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,530
it is the s3 buckets you can get this

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,720
data and that's a substantial amount of

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,760
data and it's been growing rapidly so

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,240
those are areas where we already

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,340
contribute quite a lot to the back back

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,940
to the community and can you tell me

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,250
what your short-term vision is for let's

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,740
say the next 6 to 12 months what what

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,740
would you like to see happen with AWS

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,380
and open and and the communities here at

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,030
Austin this was a few projects that

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,410
particularly interested in so my talk

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:49,720
tomorrow's on a patchy MX net when we

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,150
decided to work with this MX net project

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,130
it was a university research project and

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,470
we looked at all the different ways that

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,060
we could support it and eventually we

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,070
work with that project to say let's

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,180
become let's go for Apache Incubator

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,270
round

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,790
AWS is about 35% of the contributions

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,889
there's major contributions from Apple

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,650
more recently Tesla's got involved

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,570
there's a Microsoft Stanford few of the

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,180
universities and a few companies in

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,669
China in particular all contributing to

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,460
build a deep learning framework which

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,530
has a broad applicability and that's

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,240
something where we're currently in the

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,680
incubator process so maybe in a year

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,660
we'll be you know we're just beginning

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,860
the incubator process it's sort of just

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,270
starting to the point where we're

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,419
getting the code moved over and those

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,410
things that I think in a year will be

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,590
we'll be looking for more contributors

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,930
and a you know much further down the

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,210
process there but we really like using

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,010
the Apache framework to manage the

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,710
collaboration between all these

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,110
different companies and that's the the

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,300
core there certainly that's one project

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,160
we're putting a lot of focus on it and I

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,870
think we're going to see that move

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,100
forward a long way in a year and then

00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,110
just the results we're going to be

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,789
talking lots of people about what they'd

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,100
like us to do and I think in a year we

00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:04,210
come back we'll be talking about the

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,099
things we've actually done in response

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,169
to them yeah and as well as the people

00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,660
which are the guy outside and we're also

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,360
growing our team and to help support

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,580
this and so we'll have more people or

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,820
it's been Erik Adrienne myself in the

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,860
room and we're also talking to betweens

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,260
internally as well we have a whole

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,389
amount of energy and passion around open

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,090
source in the company and developers

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,280
that are releasing code that want to do

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,770
more and actually supporting them in

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,020
that work and showing up at the

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,270
conferences and encouraging them to

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,669
speak because they're almost there but

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,310
they kind of need to may need that help

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,720
over that hurdle right yeah

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,430
when we prepared a little call

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,370
internally we've got about 20 people

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,139
from AWS came to yeah they're all

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,479
contributors to a Pacific kind of

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,729
helping with the booth thing I'm sorry

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,460
no Scott so the example of the MX and

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,979
the open also is part of a good

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,720
ecosystem again because you're giving

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,550
and you're getting and you're giving in

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,169
you're getting yeah because as you are

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,380
I'm going to steering it's a large

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,540
external community

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,940
I mean where does one influence on it so

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,430
it's not something we own what we wanted

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,960
to provide a lot of input to it like I

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,980

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,140
we'll be building our products on top of

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,790
our AI products on top of it but it's a

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,950
much larger thing to build and that's

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:34,099
kind of a new approach for AWS

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:37,240
to be taking a major piece of technology

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,320
