Description: 
	Move fast and break things is a mantra thatâ€™s helped us learn, innovate, and push boundaries at speeds only dreamt about by other industries. However, there are times when that speed comes at a cost, when moving fast means moving past problems that we should sit with and unpack.

Saron Yitbarek explores examples of technical projects in education, health, and grassroots political activism that moved too fast, pointing out how these projects hurt users or failed to solve a problem in irreparable ways and where well-meaning developers would have benefitted from reaching beyond their immediate network to ask more questions and understand the implications of the tools they built.
