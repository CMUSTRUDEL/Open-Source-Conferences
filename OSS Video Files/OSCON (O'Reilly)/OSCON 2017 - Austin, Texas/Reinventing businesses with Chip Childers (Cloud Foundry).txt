hi this is Mike Hendrickson FAMAS con

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:08,040
2017 in Austin Texas I'm here with chip

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,519
Childers from Cloud Foundry UCT oh right

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,040
that's correct yep CTO is the cosmetics

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,509
foundation yeah which is the industry

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,029
association that's responsible for all

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,340
the upstream development as well as the

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,740
shared market efforts could all of our

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,170
members do together so can you give me a

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,230
little history about how the cloud found

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,750
Cloud Foundry foundation formed and why

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,759
sure so let's first start with what is

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,340
Cloud Foundry okay it's a cloud native

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,410
application platform it's designed to

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,059
help enterprise developers build

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,190
software that's meaningful to visit for

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:46,230
their business faster and its primary

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,550
use case we're at this point in industry

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,379
and I'm using the word industry in a

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,090
very general sense because across a lot

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,680
of different specific verticals whether

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,219
you're talking financial services heavy

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,100
industry telecom automotive software is

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,260
is more and more critical for every

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,379
business so if you look at for example

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,170
the list of Fortune 500 companies from

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,400
the year 2000 on more than 52 percent of

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,840
them are no longer on that list yeah

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,260
right so we've got an accelerating rate

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,020
of change it turns out that software is

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,619
exactly why that rate of change is

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,049
increasing and and so companies with a

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,729
lot of people a lot of knowledge a lot

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,840
of customer base they're actually in a

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,220
very good position if they can figure

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
out how to use technology well and moves

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,560
really quickly so Cs designed to help

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,860
them most of our users are within the

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,189
fortune 500 global 2000 it's it's when a

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,200
company wants to really reinvent itself

00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:43,890
so cloud native application platform

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,420
helps for faster software delivery it

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,409
was originally created by VMware several

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,909
years ago I'm probably going to forget

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,860
it because more than five years ago now

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,899
at this point so it's created by VMware

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,439
I was initiative that the polymer its

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,630
spirit up spirit spearheaded at VMware

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,969
they launched it and they open source

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,049
the software and then if you remember

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,860
out of VMware and out of EMC case they

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,720
spun out a number of assets and

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,580
created pivotal software right so

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,620
pivotal labs plus the greenplum

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,200
technology plus clock foundry and spring

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,970
source that became pivotal software and

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,790
pivotal was then the steward of the

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,990
cloud foundry platform and the open

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,810
source community around it for a number

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,420
of years but in January of 2015

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,550
they actually handed off control of the

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,040
software itself all the intellectual

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,900
property and the trademark and formed

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,830
this foundation which is an industry

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,540
association to let them more effectively

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,890
work with their frankly their

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,320
competitors rights or competitors like

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,610
IBM with the bluemix platform that's

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,350
based on cloud foundry because we all do

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,480
better when we all do better absolutely

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,670
yeah absolutely so talk a little bit

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,850
about how the structure of the

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,130
foundation the foundry works

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,780
business-wise and technical wise you

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,209
have two different models on how people

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,650
can be involved yeah absolutely it's

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,020
really it's actually a very common

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,660
pattern now the thing to remember is

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,670
that the foundations like the Cloud

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,760
Foundry foundation are our industry

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,650
associations right on the on the other

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,720
hand they're also focused on supporting

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,330
an open source community and open source

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,000
development and we've learned a lot as a

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,680
technology industry about how openness

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,769
and how collaboration across companies

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,420
across any vector of diversity that you

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:33,010
can think of makes for a stronger

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:36,340
software product or project so there's a

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,980
very very clear line of firewall between

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,860
the management of the foundation

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,500
business and the focus on helping create

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,390
you know and market the common platform

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,780
that a lot of distributions are based on

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,910
from the technical product development

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,350
itself and the open source nature of

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,299
that right yeah absolutely it's a

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,530
naturally open source and you know I

00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,700
call it a product because it is

00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,140
interesting you know oftentimes when we

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,250
talk about open source we refer to it as

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:06,880
projects okay but a lot of open source

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,549
projects actually are whoa photonics

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,350
right and it doesn't have to be we don't

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,700
need to think about open source

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,739
development is something that produces

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,180
libraries that like somebody else is

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,769
going to cobble together into some

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,870
it's useful for for marketing no cell

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,940
instead we can think about development

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,910
of these these massive open-source

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,750
projects in a way that very much lines

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,120
up with product development you know but

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,770
I explain that because we look at the

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,190
the core Cloud Foundry platform as a

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,800
Prada and upstream product and then we

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,680
have downstream distributions of it that

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,509
are that are certified distributions and

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,520
we've got guaranteed consistency between

00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,530
them and that guaranteed consistency is

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,830
because they're using the exact release

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,780
from the upstream collaboration so we

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,449
put as a community a large amount of

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,550
effort into coordinated releases when

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:03,070
you say community yeah this community

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,389
straddled the tech and the business well

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,789
it could mean both but I can talk about

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,900
the technology community briefly so

00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:12,250
we've we have over I think it's over

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,750
2500 contributors that have contributed

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,060
at some point in time in the last six

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,360
months been about fifteen hundred we

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,440
have 170 people across a number of

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,659
different companies that are working

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,720
full-time think of them as the

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,430
maintainer x' but but for us we're

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,870
moving at such a velocity that being a

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,659
maintainer means that you should be

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,860
working full-time predominantly so about

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,880
a hundred and seventy people globally

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,949
that are working full-time on the

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,750
project with other companies but I have

00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,550
contributing to compound contributor

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,570
absolutely and they're all employed by

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,580
the either the member companies or you

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,470
know they they have the opportunity as

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,949
an individual they could become a

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,240
committer just as an individual but

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,070
being honest this is software used by

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,440
Fortune 500's that's distributed by

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,539
commercial vendors so most are funded to

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,990
do the workflow so do you have any sort

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:04,870
of on-ramp program for let's say a large

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,150
financial company that understands that

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,599
they need to transition to cloud native

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,419
or be disrupted by someone who's going

00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,669
to start up another do you have some

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,409
sort of on-ramp for a company is facing

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,000
that that is a that is a really good

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,070
question so I have to cut that into a

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,520
couple of different parts so the the

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,260
challenge that a Enterprise has today is

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,320
much greater than just knowing how to

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,009
use our software right okay so we don't

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,979
directly saw

00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,900
of the broader problem but most of our

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,029
distributions are heavily involved in

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,169
that I'll give you two to concrete

00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:43,270
examples so pivotal labs is a component

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:45,759
fertile software is all about teaching

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,199
an enterprise how to operate like a

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,309
Silicon Valley startup right what are

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,589
the right software development

00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:52,389
methodologies to use if you take a look

00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:56,430
at the bluemix garage model it's the

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:59,319
exact same thing but we're also we have

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,110
companies like cognizant and Accenture

00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:04,629
and Capgemini they're all involved as

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,550
well in in the foundation and they have

00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,430
practices around digital transformation

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,770
so CS plays a big part is the technology

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,409
underpinning for the way that they help

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,580
enterprises go through that transition

00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:17,319
but we don't directly solve the

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,120
transitional problem for them but there

00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,770
are best practices know they're around

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,879
absolutely.i best practices built around

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,830
it and they've propagated through the

00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,649
ecosystem now you know the other part of

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:30,249
this is that we we know we know actually

00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:33,069
in a very very acute way how challenging

00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:36,729
it is right now for enterprises to find

00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:39,069
qualified developers we recently did a

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,110
global market study that gave us a very

00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,120
good feel for the what we call the

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,099
developer skill gap and that is not to

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,349
imply that developers are lacking skill

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,839
it's actually to imply that the skills

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:53,680
of development cloud native development

00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,899
specifically are needed by all of these

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,360
companies so a great example that I give

00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:00,069
you is that Express Scripts you familiar

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,830
with them yeah yeah big pharmaceutical

00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:05,169
supply chain company right so Express

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,879
Scripts started off with a cloud foundry

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,259
deployment and then they created a small

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,709
team that learned how to operate quickly

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,709
as well development using cloud foundry

00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,879
they figured that that really small team

00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,499
could start to demonstrate a lot of

00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,459
rapid time value for the amount of

00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:23,229
business it did and now the the head of

00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,719
that team was then challenged to go from

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,819
single digits to a thousand by the end

00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:30,490
of this year so he's got a huge

00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,740
developer ramped up problem one of the

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,419
things that we're launching at our event

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,909
which is coming up in June is a

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,039
portfolio of training and then developer

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,329
certification its products with a whole

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,900
number of different partners that were

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:42,880
lining up

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,500
they're going to support it we want to

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,110
get as much knowledge about this

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:52,060
baseline Cloud Foundry platform out as

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,730
we can in addition to what we're going

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,440
to offer all of the distributions are

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,970
will the district the commercial

00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,230
distributions then have the places that

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,060
they're able to differentiate from each

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,040
other so think about IBM it has its

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,710
Watson capability where GE predicts

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,710
which is based on foundry as well very

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,550
focused on industrial Internet

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,900
applications in these cases so they have

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,060
services that tie into the same

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,950
consistent core Cloud Foundry experience

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,260
so what we're trying to do is ensure

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,140
that there's a baseline of base of basic

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,490
cloud foundry capability and knowledge

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,790
easily addressable to the market you

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,220
know easily gotten to as a developer

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,870
that wants to learn it and easily

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,760
delivered as a company who wants to

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,110
train their existing developers that's

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,940
actually portable across these

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,470
distributions excellent I think that's

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,600
pretty important you guys have a full

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,550
agenda and we look forward to seeing

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,330
that unfold next year that's great thank

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,330
you thank you very much

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,420
