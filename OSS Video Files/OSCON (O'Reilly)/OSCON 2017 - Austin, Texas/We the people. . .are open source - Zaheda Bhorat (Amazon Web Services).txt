hello Oscar hi hi I am a immigrant a

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:25,250
woman and a computer scientist I'm also

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:26,570
a member of this community and today I

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,289
want to talk to you about some of the

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:34,370
things we all do in open-source by the

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:37,670
way this is not my age it was 18 years

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,040
ago in Monterrey California on this

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,980
beautiful coastline that we held the

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,040
first ever ask on and that was right

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,170
after the poll conference that brian

00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,390
behlendorf referenced yesterday in his

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:55,850
keynote so at sun microsystems and we

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,940
announced open office at that conference

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,300
which was my first project leading that

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,820
and building this vibrant community of

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,159
contributors all around the world now

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,109
I'm sure many of you have actually used

00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,319
the software or you may have contributed

00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:13,700
to it or you may be using an Libre which

00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:20,329
is the origins of the Open Office

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:24,349
codebase and as a community we do

00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:27,649
contribute I know it's the last keynote

00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:30,709
of this event and I'm going to ask you

00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:32,649
to participate in this so I have a

00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:36,169
question like how many in this room

00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:39,409
contribute anything to open-source could

00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:41,740
you stand yeah I'm going to get you to

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,740
get up

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,680
okay that's alright now I can see okay

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,550
the lights are on great Wow okay and if

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,800
you contribute just code then sit down

00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:02,020
so if you contribute more than code

00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,670
remain standing Wow okay look around you

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,000
there's still a lot of people standing

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:10,360
this community contributes be more than

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,160
just code and I just want to applaud all

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:20,500
of you that we're standing earlier as

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:23,290
well a collaboration is another key

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,650
aspect of open-source and we all know

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:30,610
that so Google Summer of Code is a

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:34,510
really excellent example of that and the

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,700
company helping it's an example of a

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,130
company helping to teach collaboration

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,890
to a whole new generation of students

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,730
and part of open-source participants and

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,380
it was really the first example that

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,019
mentorship was really called out as a

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,510
really important value in our community

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,980
to bring people on board and it's been

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,890
really successful and it's been running

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,400
for over thirteen years and it's

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,070
generated over 30 million lines of code

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,980
now I was privileged to work on the

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:09,780
first two years of open source of Summer

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:12,549
of Code and and this man here Greg Stein

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,209
he meant heard myself and Chris DiBona

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,950
in creating the program in the kind of

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,989
Apache way at the time he was a

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:23,890
president of the Apache Software

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:27,010
Foundation and he also helped to shape

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,489
the open-source program office so we

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,530
created this model which was I guess the

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,130
first kind first of its kind really

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,160
where a program office was actually

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:42,600
concentrating on contributions and that

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,519
not just all the internal compliance and

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,000
tooling but really on engagements with

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,799
the community so Greg also had a

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,590
full-time day job as a software engineer

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,340
and who's doing this work on the side

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,620
mentoring us and

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,440
this is now being replicated in

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,459
companies and in governments around the

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,739
world many of these folks you will know

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,890
as speakers here at OSCON if you've been

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:15,130
before and these are the program offices

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:19,489
so from github PayPal Salesforce and

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:21,739
Comcast and obviously you all know Chris

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,380
Costa Boehner and Chris Anna check and

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:27,790
these member companies they may can

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:33,620
compete on software but in open source

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:36,050
there's great collaboration so before an

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:40,460
open source program office is created in

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,260
any company their internal champions are

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,360
software developers that download the

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,850
code and you kind of know because some

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,940
of you have already done this and you

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:53,240
convince your managers you convince your

00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,790
product managers to integrate the code

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,530
into the products and you work with the

00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,140
lawyers and that's not really the fun

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,770
part of what we all have to do but we do

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,820
that and we work on compliance and this

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:12,020
is we have a set of first followers and

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:14,750
I guess early adopters and first

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,470
followers in our organizations and this

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,930
change happens before any company

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,220
decides to have someone like myself

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:27,350
onstage here representing them there's a

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,130
whole host of people that come before me

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,139
convinced in an organization that

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,150
open-source is important to the company

00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:39,470
and that they need to take these steps

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:42,200
and there are many engineers and product

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,570
managers who champion the open source

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,729
and so that we can deliver the products

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,330
and services that our customers love and

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:54,590
many of them are in the room as I said

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:58,490
so AWS we're also we also have our own

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,710
internal champions and Henry and Elle is

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,080
with the Apache he's a member of the

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:07,159
Apache Software Foundation and he's been

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,560
tirelessly working internally getting

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:11,470
adoption

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,850
and actually working with the engineers

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:19,090
on our contributions and with the help

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,940
of the heroes at AWS we've been making

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,880
contributions to open-source since 2005

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,360
and many of you may not have come across

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,020
AWS we've been doing the work a lot of

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,940
small and medium sized projects and

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,250
contributions for bug fixes patches and

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:41,080
some very large contributions to the

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:43,210
Linux kernel botos then this also

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,460
includes releasing our own code as well

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,350
as contributing to other projects we

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,350
want to be doing a lot more of this and

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,660
we've also co-founded two open source

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:57,090
foundations so you may not have noticed

00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:00,070
that and participated in many more and

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,750
we've been doing all this work we just

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,180
haven't been talking about it and you

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,850
know as Brad said there's a lot of

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,280
people working behind the scenes and you

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:12,370
know we get to come up here and talk

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,840
about this work and that's all changing

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,470
so we now have a team at AWS agent CO

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,039
Croft

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,870
I ruined Gupta and myself so you know

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,510
the team has been coming to us con for

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,690
over many years between us we've got

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:30,400
over 40 years of experience in

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,919
open-source and we're going to be the

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,770
voice of the customer and the community

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:38,500
the open source community within AWS and

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,780
outside our team is growing we're

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,300
growing our contributions come and talk

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:47,950
to us there's a feisty Bunch downstairs

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,020
in the expo mound and we've been here

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,630
all this week we had a great boss

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:56,350
yesterday and we want to carry on with a

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:59,520
conte with conversations with you you

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:04,240
can find us in the booth or in Adrian's

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,340
talk after this at 11 o'clock and one

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,320
last thing is we stand on the shoulders

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,020
of giants now you're familiar with these

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,630
giants what you may not know of these

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,240
giants these are lesson and women that

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,880
have been working tirelessly alongside

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,060
me in open source

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,820
and for a lot longer you see it's about

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,660
the people and Apache the saying is

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:31,570
community over code because we the

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:37,810
community we do all of these things and

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:39,570
we stand together because we are

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:46,029
open-source thank you

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,029
