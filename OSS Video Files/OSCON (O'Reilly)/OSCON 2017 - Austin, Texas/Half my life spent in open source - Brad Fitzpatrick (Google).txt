so when modems kind of came out or AOL

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,750
became the thing we got a o L at some

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,710
point and it was really fun to hear you

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,770
know you've got mail

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,260
and that's when it was still novel and I

00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,390
would be chatting with some friends in

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,940
various chat rooms and I'd be telling

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,800
them secret Intel you know confidential

00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,420
roadmap features that my dad had told me

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,190
because you know whatever is just some

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,020
friends online but it turned out that

00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,600
this chatroom was actually using it and

00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,079
my dad's co-workers and my dad's boss

00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:41,220
were also in this Usenet group so sorry

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:43,530
dad so I kept kind of showing off on AOL

00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,510
and I was like flooding chat rooms with

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,510
VB scripts that were sending like win32

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,570
key events to the window and I flooded

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,489
some forms to request an AOL CD and got

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,079
like thousands of AOL CDs delivered in

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,030
the mail by doing different permutations

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:04,649
of my home address so I got kicked off

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:07,250
AOL um but that was good because we

00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:10,799
found a local ISP heaven ette and this

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,020
local ISP came with a show prompt and I

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,540
liked typing things with the boxes

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,640
so I started typing things into the box

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,020
and the things I knew to type into boxes

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,420
didn't work so I had to learn some new

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,920
things to type the other great thing

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,860
about heaven Etta's I had this directory

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,299
and if I put files in it I got a website

00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,270
so I had to learn some HTML to make my

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,340
really terrible website but generating

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,290
all the pages by hand was tedious so I

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,540
started using Perl to auto-generate all

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,850
my pages on the site and at this point

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,470
you could probably ask why I picked Perl

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,210
and something else but this was like

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,659
1995 and there wasn't really any other

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,970
options Ruby at the time was like 0.095

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,710
or something and it was only a Japanese

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,530
the only Japanese I know is how to leave

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,500
a building it was not quite enough to

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,900
program so don't bash other technologies

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,399
just I mean consider that the other

00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,229
language or technology maybe was just

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,549
the only option at the time or maybe it

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,840
was like a considered engineering

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,100
trade-off and somebody had different

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,380
values than you did about what they

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,090
thought was right I certainly bashed

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,249
things all the time but anyway so I'm

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,760
using Perl I'm like on the forums all

00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:14,680
the time reading

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,659
and there's chatter in the forums about

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,299
this book camel - that was coming out

00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,310
and so one winter I'm skiing with my

00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,709
family and me and my dad are like taking

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,569
the skis off the top of the car and I'm

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,099
saying to my dad hey you know the camel

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,489
to book is out now we should go pick it

00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,900
up afterwards and just as I'm doing that

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,450
this guy walks by me in the parking lot

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,090
and said did you say camel - as in

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,659
programming Perl second edition and I

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:43,319
was like yeah and he's like hey I'm

00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,319
