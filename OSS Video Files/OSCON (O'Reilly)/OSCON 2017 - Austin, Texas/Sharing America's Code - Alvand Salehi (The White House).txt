hello ask on what our privilege to be

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,539
giving a keynote at this conference in

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,730
particular I really do feel at home with

00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,950
all of you here one person who's really

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,630
made me feel at home is the individual

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,420
who does put this conference on every

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,859
single year with great success let's

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,619
give it up for the ASEAN share one more

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:32,730
time Rachel Rimmel Yoda's dysphoric

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:34,559
Rachel so as Rachel said I'm Alvin filet

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,030
he had the privilege of working at the

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,270
White House for a little while now since

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,789
2015 to be exact and since then we've

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,230
actually been fortunate enough to make

00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,090
some significant strides in the world of

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,239
government tech one of the things that

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,600
we've been working on with great great

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,640
efforts is trying to figure out ways to

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,500
unlock the potential of open source

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,609
software across the entire federal

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,920
government now I'm not exactly sure how

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,860
everybody here feels about open source I

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,140
think I can guess but just to be sure

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,700
I'm going to put up a quote from a

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,130
recent wire article from a few months

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,729
back and you can let me know whether you

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,130
agree with this or not the court says

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,090
open source is among the most important

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,600
ideas in the history of technology what

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,600
do you think about that

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,790
I thought that's how you might react all

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,040
right so now that we know we're all in

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,220
the same page this article goes on to

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,470
say this the source code policy is the

00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,210
latest in a long line of high profile

00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,820
victories for the open source movement

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:47,200
now as many of you are aware back in

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:50,380
August of last year 2016 after years of

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,909
bureaucratic hurdling after months of

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,429
direct engagement with the tech

00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:56,979
community and after thousands of public

00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,170
comments directly from you on github and

00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,270
other public channels we were able to

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,880
finally release the country's first ever

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:12,630
federal policy that actually advocates

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:14,980
for open source software pretty big deal

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,260
one of the reasons this is important is

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,940
because many of our aware that the

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,650
federal government spends a lot of money

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,750
on software transactions every year

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,560
we're talking to the tune of billions of

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,690
dollars on thousands of transactions and

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,190
unfortunately many of these transactions

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,100
up until recently have been duplicative

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,410
meaning that the government is actually

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,480
unknowingly spending money for software

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,769
that it's already developed needless to

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,319
say that's highly inefficient and quite

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,970
frankly it's unacceptable and we decided

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,650
we had to put an end to it to ensure

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,720
that we're spending your hard-earned

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,170
taxpayer dollars responsibly and

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,760
efficiently so that was a significant

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,310
achievement of the policy but that

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,480
wasn't the only thing we achieved no we

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,799
were just getting warmed up

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,040
the next thing that we achieved was this

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:05,850
the federal source code policy

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,200
specifically requires two things one

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,239
government-wide reuse what does that

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,190
mean from this point forward all

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,950
contracts for custom developed software

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,690
must require that that code be allowed

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,750
to be shared and reused across the

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,970
entire federal government to ensure that

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,120
we are reducing those duplicative

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,350
acquisitions the other thing and I think

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,889
you guys will be more excited about this

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,889
one

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:32,590
is this we launched an unprecedented

00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:36,640
pilot program that requires that at

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,290
least at least 20% of all and custom

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,730
developed government code must be

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:50,860
released to the public as

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:53,799
open-source software so the interesting

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,959
thing about this is it's actually quite

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,879
significant because as many of us know

00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,440
effectuating positive change across the

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,340
federal government is really difficult

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,709
and it's especially difficult when

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,709
you're trying to release code but the

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,120
use case was clear as long as we carve

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,950
out exemptions for national security

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,209
privacy and other sensitive information

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,350
releasing open source code presented the

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,630
federal government with a unique

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,820
opportunity to actually leverage the

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,190
brilliant brain power of technologists

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:28,090
all around the country to review and

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,910
improve our nation's software and now

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,789
it's more that it's easier the easiest

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,490
has ever been for anybody anytime

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:38,620
anyplace to give back to the country

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,930
through code and you might be wondering

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,340
art Alvin what's the easiest way for me

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,660
to give back what's the easiest way for

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,500
me to submit a pull request on a

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,570
government repo

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:52,750
well enter code dot gov code gov is now

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,669
the nation's primary destination for

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,849
sharing and improving government

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,470
software I've had a lot of people come

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:02,440
up to me recently especially over the

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,740
last few months to ask me Alvin what is

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,210
in store for code gov what does the

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,950
future of the platform look like and

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,750
it's a completely valid question

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,479
particularly because we have new

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,710
leadership in the White House thankfully

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,450
the new administration is also

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,060
supportive of this initiative why

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,710
because the facts are clear as we said

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,229
the federal source code policy and now

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,970
kodaka have the potential to save the

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,130
federal government and by proxy the

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,410
American taxpayers millions of dollars

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,110
by cutting excessive spending due to

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,349
discipline of acquisitions and quite

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,340
frankly folks I'm happy to share that

00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:38,470
saving money is something that the

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,510
federal government invariably supports

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,430
and as something type of government will

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,039
always support and should always support

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:49,180
regardless of whether you are red or

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,640
blue I happen to be wearing both by the

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,260
way just so you

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,940
all jokes aside though this is a

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,980
completely nonpartisan issue as it

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,680
should be and it's something we can all

00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,720
get behind so with that I'm excited to

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:15,590
declare right here on this stage right

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:17,240
now that code gov is here to stay since

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,180
we launched coda back in November we've

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,710
already made significant progress nearly

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,210
90% of all agencies covered in the

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,670
federal source code policy are already

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,200
represented on code gov here's a quick

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,260
snapshot of several of the agencies that

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,760
you'll find on code gov currently and

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,620
I'm scanning across the room I see a lot

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,510
of people smiling and I suspect the

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,890
smiles are due to the fact that a lot of

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,510
these agencies or agencies that you

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,740
never would have expected would actually

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,520
release their code as open-source

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,030
software

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,620
and frankly I love to see that reaction

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,390
because that is the epitome of culture

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,780
change and we're achieving it at the

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,700
federal level on that note I always get

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,760
asked one question about one particular

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,740
agency because people are very dubious

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,050
that this agency would ever release code

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,360
and I'm sure you can guess it the agency

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:07,370
is this the Department of Defense and

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,490
you know this is the best part about

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,700
this whole story even the Department of

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,650
Defense is releasing code is open source

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,900
software the Pentagon is releasing

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,340
projects as open source software it's

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,930
incredible if you had told me that a few

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,419
years ago I wouldn't have believed it

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,500
and that is a great sign that what we're

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,330
doing is actually making a difference

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,710
and we're actually trying to achieve our

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:34,130
objectives here now one of the projects

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,880
that they just recently released is for

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,110
lack of a better word completely badass

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,220
sorry but there's actually no other way

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,040
to describe it and I'll tell you why

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,790
this software is currently being used in

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,479
Afghanistan as part of a NATO mission to

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:53,600
help advise a scan officials in

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,070
rebuilding their country incredible it's

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,100
amazing it blows my mind every time I

00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,979
hear about it and today I'm going to

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,490
lift the curtain on the story behind

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:07,710
that incredible code

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:10,460
okay so let's step back and give you

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,720
some context quickly as we all know

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,449
there are several missions that take

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,130
place around the world all the time one

00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,479
of the missions that were currently

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,750
involved in it's called Operation

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,750
resolute support it's a train advise

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,840
assist mission led by NATO in

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:30,630
Afghanistan that involves approximately

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,089
13,000 troops one of the issues that

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,469
they were experiencing recently was a

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:38,610
pretty simple issue if you think about

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:42,330
it these NATO advisors usually rotate in

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,420
and out every single year okay and as a

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,360
result it becomes increasingly difficult

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,149
to track which advisors have trained

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,630
which officials so when a new advisor

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,190
comes in typically there is some

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,430
duplicate of training that takes place

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,020
as the old advisor rotates out duplicate

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,390
of training as we know leads to an

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,649
efficiency and inefficiency leads to

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,930
excessive spending are you starting to

00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,490
sense a theme here duplicative work is

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,320
no stranger to the federal government

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,570
but it's something that we are committed

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,020
to working on resolving addressing every

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:19,220
single day so how did we address this

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:23,370
particular issue in Afghanistan well

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,660
enter the Defense digital service these

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,820
folks are part of the u.s. digital

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,310
service which is essentially the tech

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,890
SWAT team of the federal government

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,270
they're incredible one person in

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,459
particular that I want to point out is

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,170
the young lady on the left she was the

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:41,760
manager on this project her name is Erin

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:44,640
Delaney Erin had a cushy job in the

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,100
private sector in Silicon Valley and she

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,930
decided you know what I want to go join

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,149
the government to give back to the

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,220
country through tech so that's exactly

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,550
what she did came to DC and I kid you

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,060
not

00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:00,180
one month just one month into her job

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:04,079
she found herself in a Black Hawk

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,089
helicopter on her way to Kabul to help

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,990
NATO troops solve their most pressing

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:12,300
tech problems amazing so let's fast

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,220
forward a few months and it turns out

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,779
that the NATO troops were using a piece

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,470
of software that was essentially a

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,780
clunky

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,880
of crm software that took hours and

00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,010
hours to actually learn how to use and

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,560
so as a result not many people were

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:29,430
using it the right way so after a couple

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,290
of discovery sprints in Afghanistan the

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,030
DVS team the Defense digital service

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,190
decided you know what we got to rebuild

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,710
this from scratch this time with the

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,660
users rather than for the users right

00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,980
user centered design very important

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,470
principle in building a successful

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,770
product what did they call the project

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,530
the project was called a net short for

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,090
the adviser Network and if you think

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,890
about it

00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:55,170
DDS was in a bit of a time crunch

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,360
because every day that NATO advisors

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,760
didn't have a successful and useful

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,250
piece of software to use was another day

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,120
that they were not able to track their

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,130
engagement successfully so if only there

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,050
were some sort of platform to help build

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,480
you build your software efficiently

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,940
especially when part of your team is in

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,350
Kabul and the other part is in

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,140
Washington DC I think you can see where

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,170
this is going what these guys decided to

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,690
do was actually use github to help build

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,220
their software which in and of itself is

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,940
pretty progressive for the Pentagon if

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,920
you think about it on top of that it

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,830
actually worked they ended up building a

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,240
beta version of a net in just 14 weeks

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:42,900
and then they made one of their boldest

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,440
decisions yet the DBS team made this

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:52,190
call let's release a net as open-source

00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:56,460
software when I think about forget shelf

00:11:52,190 --> 00:12:00,720
so you might be thinking this wait a

00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,550
second Alvin assuming that all the

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
information exchanged as part of these

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,420
NATO missions is classified and

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,010
confidential what an open sourcing the

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,800
project presents some sort of risks and

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,410
national security so have people shaking

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,000
their heads the answer is no as we all

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,550
know open sourcing something doesn't

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,050
mean releasing classified coordinates it

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,090
doesn't mean releasing personally

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,620
identifiable information in fact that

00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,850
information is completely separate as it

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,020
should be it shouldn't be part of your

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,940
code to begin with that's just bad

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,040
practice regardless of whether you're

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:34,960
open sourcing something or not so what

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:38,020
folks did was they took the project

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,070
itself went to Afghanistan and installed

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:44,530
it on a classified secret server in

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,770
Afghanistan not available to any member

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,620
of the public and then separately they

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,620
took the self-contained project and

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,420
released it as open-source software and

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:59,110
it's a pretty useful software if you

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:02,020
think about it at its core a net is just

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,430
an intuitive tracking platform so in the

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,930
government context that can be used in a

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,960
lot of different ways the State

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,600
Department and USAID they can use it to

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,770
track their engagements abroad and their

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,000
missions NGOs can use it to help

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,670
facilitate their work in developing

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,500
countries frankly you can use it to

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,370
track your what you ate for breakfast it

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,000
really doesn't matter

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,280
the fact is it's yours you paid for it

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,800
we the federal government built it and

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,370
now it's yours to use

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,580
end of story and with that I'm excited

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:40,530
to officially announce that a net is now

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,530
on code gov

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:54,040
so incredible story as we bring this

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:58,269
amazing journey we've shared to a close

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,740
I want you to think about something this

00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:01,899
is a different site of open-source we

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,639
don't always get to see we've talked

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,709
about the cost savings aspect which is

00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,230
very significant we've talked about

00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:12,009
transparency with open source also very

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:14,250
important but this is a side of open

00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:17,620
source that offers the potential of

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,199
technology to help bolster the safety of

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,329
Americans abroad and the ability of open

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:24,940
source software the software itself to

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,910
potentially help our troops and our

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:32,230
advisors around the world in fulfilling

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:34,089
their objectives and I'm certain that

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,569
more stories like this will emerge as

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:40,720
code gov continues to grow as a national

00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:42,759
platform so I'd like to end on a quote

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,440
that I think sums up our efforts pretty

00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,699
nicely from Robert Frost

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:52,329
he wrote this almost a hundred years ago

00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:56,310
it says the woods are lovely dark and

00:14:52,329 --> 00:15:01,269
deep but I have promises to keep and

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:03,730
miles to go before I sleep we've come a

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:07,060
long way in the world of open source as

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:10,389
a community but we're not quite out of

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,040
the woods yet right I promise you

00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,250
culture change and we're delivering on

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,160
that promise as you can see but we still

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,870
have miles and miles to go before we

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,120
reach the end of this journey and we

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:27,449
can't reach the end without your help

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,800
and your support so what are you saying

00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:33,760
here's to getting out of the woods

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,010
together and working with one another to

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,970
unlock the true value of open-source

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:42,529
software for the entire country thank

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,589
you thank you very much

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,589
