Description: 
	Fans of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes will undoubtedly remember when Calvin invented the transmogrifier, an ingenious device that could turn one thing into another with a quick “ZAP!” Besides the obvious physical characteristics—one upside-down corrugated fiberboard enclosure, some black ink, and a radial dial—little is known about how this magical device actually worked. I’d imagine that most people are fine with that, but I can’t help but wonder. . .

Evan Booth explains how his adventures in real-world transmogrification have shaped his perspective on open source hardware, manufacturing, and finding potential in the unremarkable.
