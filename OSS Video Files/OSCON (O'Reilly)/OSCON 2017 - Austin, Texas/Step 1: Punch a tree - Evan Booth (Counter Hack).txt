Title: Step 1: Punch a tree - Evan Booth (Counter Hack)
Publication date: 2017-05-10
Playlist: OSCON 2017 - Austin, Texas
Description: 
	Fans of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes will undoubtedly remember when Calvin invented the transmogrifier, an ingenious device that could turn one thing into another with a quick “ZAP!” Besides the obvious physical characteristics—one upside-down corrugated fiberboard enclosure, some black ink, and a radial dial—little is known about how this magical device actually worked. I’d imagine that most people are fine with that, but I can’t help but wonder. . .

Evan Booth explains how his adventures in real-world transmogrification have shaped his perspective on open source hardware, manufacturing, and finding potential in the unremarkable.

	00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,910
so pretty pretty safe to assume that

00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:08,380
I've taken apart a tremendous amount of

00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,820
things and I think that when someone

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,500
does that a couple of things happen

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,790
right the first thing is that you know

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,320
as you're going along the amount of

00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,299
information you glean from that process

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,380
increases drastically right at first

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,760
you're like yeah what's inside this

00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,470
thing before you know it you're taking

00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,880
something apart and it's like having a

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,010
conversation with the person who

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,050
designed it right it's you get insight

00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,510
you can make assumptions about you know

00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,070
about their goals and they're there in

00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,869
the design process and for me that's

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,160
really interesting again you know kind

00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:35,680
of voyeuristic way of looking at that

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,329
process because of my background of

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,890
building digital stuff right it's hard

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,989
for me to not compare the two design

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,800
processes and maybe think about what

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:44,320
that you might be able to learn from

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,760
each other right so the other thing that

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,829
happens is you stop looking at a thing

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,570
in terms of its output instead you start

00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,149
looking at something in terms of so the

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,430
underlying interconnected forces and

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,260
components and and things that make that

00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,790
stuff happen or for example microwaves

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,670
are not magical boxes they make hot

00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,289
pockets super dangerous right it's a

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,030
shield enclosure that you know usual

00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,439
utilizes a physical input device and

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,940
then feeds into a microcontroller which

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,830
uses timers relays and other passive

00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,390
components to you know power of a motor

00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,369
that turns a turntable with a rotational

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,479
force and a magnetron that uses

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,799
radiation to piss off the water

00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,619
molecules in your food making it hot

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,390
right so similarly this presentation is

00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,430
not you know texts and shapes and stuff

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,290
you know randomly groups and you know in

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,810
these you know rectangular slide type

00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,340
things right this is actually disk like

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,080
scalable vector graphics rotating on a

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,490
fixed axis by an animation library you

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,290
know from commands in a finite state

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,350
machine keyed on the current slide index

00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,570
right so you start looking at things in

00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,070
terms of the underlying interconnected

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,409
systems and forces and you start to

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,390
notice that you know even common stuff

00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:45,369
even if things don't have like much in

00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,290
common like functionally right there's a

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,060
lot a lot of similarities under the hood

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,979
you still behind the curtain right for

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,720
example this motor right in this

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,759
microwave provides the same rotational

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,270
force you might find in a hairdryer or

00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:01,060
maybe I'm a blender or maybe even like a

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,680
kid's toy here right I'll take it for me

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,590
these voters are not designed to be

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,310
easily replaceable let alone upgradable

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,139
or interchangeable right and so as a

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,879
software engineer in the MacGyver inmate

00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,879
has to ask the questions why

00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:21,150
and you know I think that so it's kind

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,830
of crazy right because you know in

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,500
software we celebrate concepts like

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,240
loose coupling so you know you might say

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,770
though like well the requirements are

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,900
different across those applications and

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,310
you would be absolutely right but you

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,410
know when we write code even if it's

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,930
simple code we could usually justify

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,520
spending the time to to make that code

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,560
function in a wide variety of

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,360
environments and applications right so

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,830
what can function is a loosely coupled

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,500
component in the largely unappreciated

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,540
you know bigger system right and so what

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,950
if we did take a little a little time

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,080
and make some of these components just a

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,640
little bit more smart a little more

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
intelligent at what if you could plug

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,000
one of these into a device and it can

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,070
negotiate its input and output

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,630
requirements right you know conversely

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,820
what if the device it takes the most

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,230
efficient way to operate based on what

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,950
components just happen to currently be

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,950
