Title: Why choose open infrastructure? - Christopher Aedo (IBM)
Publication date: 2017-05-10
Playlist: OSCON 2017 - Austin, Texas
Description: 
	Open source isn’t winning; it’s won. In the last decade, we’ve seen an incredible explosion in open source software. Massive projects have been developed in the open, on open operating systems, using open languages and compilers. But, Christopher Aedo asks, was all the infrastructure open as well?

Source code management, CI pipelines, chat services, and IaaS all have open alternatives, but the majority of projects are developed on closed and proprietary infrastructure. Christopher explains how to make open choices with greater community impact.

This keynote is sponsored by IBM.

	00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,820
I'm Chris Fredo I work at IBM and I'm

00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:10,980
also an open source zealot I have to

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,690
give IBM a big thanks for letting me

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,190
take this keynote slot to deliver what

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,619
is basically a public service

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,119
announcement there won't be any product

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,989
pitching and this is the only slide that

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,839
conforms to our this is a deck template

00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:28,560
so I might get in trouble after this

00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,789
we'll see so I'm going to start by

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,979
talking about infrastructure and

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,420
defining it's a big word that means lots

00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:36,710
of things different things to different

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,000
people could mean roads bridges water

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,469
supply things like that but in our world

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,870
we usually think about it as meeting

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,100
compute storage and networking when

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,829
we're talking about building software

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,989
collaboratively I'm including interest

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,539
in the infrastructure the things that we

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,239
use to build it so things like

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,769
repository management your code needs a

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,510
place to live where people can find it

00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:01,949
and consume it and contribute back

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,470
medieval medicine was based on little

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,110
more than superstition merging code

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,990
without tests is basically exactly like

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,370
medieval medicine so every project

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,050
should have tests and should have a

00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,000
solid testing infrastructure behind it

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,990
communication asynchronous synchronous

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,120
mailing lists bug trackers wiki's and

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,040
real-time chat every to build a

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,930
community and to build a project around

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,930
a community you need communication I

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,910
want to take a minute and give fair

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,980
credit to the clothes from proprietary

00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,720
platforms that a lot of people use to

00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,550
build their software they have done

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,170
enormous things for open-source and I

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,750
believe we would not be where we are

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,700
today without their help and without

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,700
what they've put forward and allowed us

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,100
to do but at the same time we're in kind

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,570
of a dangerous spot where we're relying

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,430
on a lot of platforms to build our

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,640
software that we don't have a lot of

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,370
influence or control over why do we need

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,330
choices when it comes to this because

00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,330
sometimes things go wrong

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,790
for instance you're counting on a

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,550
platform but you didn't really read the

00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,320
Terms of Service very carefully and

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,000
turns out you run afoul of those Terms

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,620
of Service and you get kicked off it

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,960
causes a huge problem for your project

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,780
or worse you discover that they're

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,430
making money off of your project in a

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,780
way you've never intended and using your

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,500
data in a way that you didn't think

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,500
what's going to happen

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,160
perhaps you're using a free service and

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,500
it's great because it's really cool

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,880
and it works awesome and you don't

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,440
realize that you're going to get to a

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,030
point where your project gets popular

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,400
enough to where you see that free tier

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,560
and suddenly your open source project

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,150
that's based and run by volunteers and

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,760
doesn't have any real money behind it

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,070
gets a ten thousand dollar bill if

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,300
you're lucky you're a really big project

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,950
when that happens to you and you can

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,830
make a big stink and let cut you some

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,630
slack or you get unlucky a lot of us

00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,190
make choices on platforms and

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,540
technologies that we use because they're

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,070
coming from startups that are doing

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,630
something really interesting and they're

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,820
disrupting the big players and it's a

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,820
lot cooler than what's then out there

00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,340
and what the incumbents are offering but

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,630
also a lot of times startups haven't

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,790
figured out their business model quite

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,010
yet and when that sweet sweet VC money

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,560
dries up they gotta shut their doors or

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,030
worse you made that decision to use that

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,110
platform because it was really cool and

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,410
you didn't like what was already out

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,450
there but that big player providing the

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,459
platform or the service that you didn't

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:38,430
really like has enough money to buy them

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:40,540
and shut him down the end of the day

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,750
most of these platforms that were

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,310
relying on to build software together

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,760
are run by companies that need to make

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,160
money

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:54,310
they've got bills to pay servers to run

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:57,510
employees to care for if we're not

00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,610
careful though we could be in trouble I

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,320
know what I'm saying probably doesn't

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,730
sound very popular right now I'm kind of

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,950
like that guy that sits down next year

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,780
on an airplane and as you're taxiing for

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,850
takeoff he starts telling your story

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,530
about that one time the pilot

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,320
miscalculated the takeoff weight and

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,480
instead of soaring majestically into the

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,400
skies at the end of the runway they

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,540
plowed right into a grove of trees and

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,790
everyone died

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,230
no one wants to hear that story and I

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,600
apologize I sound like that guy right

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,610
now I know but don't worry it's going to

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,370
be okay I'm going to talk to you about a

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,710
couple of open principles that we can

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,200
use and think about every time we're

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,700
deciding which platform which software

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,510
which technology we're going to bank on

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,770
for our open source projects so these

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,190
open principles I'm going to talk about

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:49,270
transparency interoperability and

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:52,060
influence so talk about transparency do

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,760
we have visibility into what that

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,500
company is doing how they operate what's

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,390
on the roadmap and how they deal with

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,060
their communities are they do they work

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,820
in an open way talking about the

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,880
interoperability can we get our data off

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,350
of their platform or are we locked in do

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,040
they are they based on open standards

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,690
and working in a way that it makes it

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,810
easy for us to migrate away if we ever

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,520
choose to and finally influencer are

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,710
they listening to their users are they

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,940
listening to their non-paying users are

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,440
they listening to the community of

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,150
people that use them even when that

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,090
community doesn't directly benefit their

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:34,000
bottom line there are a lot of choices

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:35,740
we can make around in this area that fit

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,010
all of these so let me talk about a few

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,080
of those for instance when it comes to

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,850
repository management I'm personally a

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,960
huge fan of gitlab because I think

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,130
they're an awesome awesome example of

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,380
transparency they do a really really

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,750
great job of letting people know how

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,310
they operate and I mean they're there

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,630
virtually entirely open even though

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,430
they're startup it needs to make money

00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,250
there are a couple other good options

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,920
you can choose to now what about testing

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,690
infrastructure Jenkins obviously it's

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,180
probably the reigning champion everyone

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,690
uses it and it's fully open but Travis

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,160
CI they're a really good example of

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,140
allowing influence they do an amazing

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
job of listening to their non paying

00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,700
users and actually working really

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,260
closely with small and even large open

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,140
source projects that are not giving them

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,550
a dime but they actually care and they

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,020
have a track record of caring further

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,940
for their users and taking care of them

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,680
like that for chat IRC is the reigning

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,220
champion it's been around for almost 30

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,410
years

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,240
and if you need the new shiny stuff

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,730
there are tons of front-ends you can use

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,610
that offer really cool stuff it's also a

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,080
great example of interoperability piracy

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,670
works virtually everywhere you have

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,260
endless choices of clients and even

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,360
servers you can run and you're not

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,280
locked in but if you're too cool for

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,590
free no check out matrix org because

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,970
that's got all the shiny stuff that you

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,800
might think you have to pay for and

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,920
that's also open and distributed and

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,080
worth looking at and finally when it

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,870
comes to the infrastructure that they

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
started talking about originally I think

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,680
people should take a really close look

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,690
at their providers and whether or not

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,310
the providers are using our based on an

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,980
open platform and if you choose an

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,400
OpenStack based provider you'll get all

00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,720
three you'll get transparency

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,060
interoperability and influence because

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,650
it's an open source project and most of

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,690
these providers that are based on

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,590
OpenStack actually work really closely

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:32,290
with the broader OpenStack community so

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,940
we are at a crossroads right now as open

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,070
source developers we are in danger of

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,830
creating a monoculture around just a few

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,360
clothes and proprietary platforms it's

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,210
not the best thing that we could be

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,530
doing and if we think carefully

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,740
sometimes making the harder choice is

00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:51,490
the right choice so if you're wondering

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:56,770
who is going to lead us who gets the

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:58,390
foul up there say nope you you are going

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,010
