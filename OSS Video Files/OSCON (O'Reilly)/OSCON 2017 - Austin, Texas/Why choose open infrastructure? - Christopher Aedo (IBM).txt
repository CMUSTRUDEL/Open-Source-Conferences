Title: Why choose open infrastructure? - Christopher Aedo (IBM)
Publication date: 2017-05-10
Playlist: OSCON 2017 - Austin, Texas
Description: 
	Open source isn’t winning; it’s won. In the last decade, we’ve seen an incredible explosion in open source software. Massive projects have been developed in the open, on open operating systems, using open languages and compilers. But, Christopher Aedo asks, was all the infrastructure open as well?

Source code management, CI pipelines, chat services, and IaaS all have open alternatives, but the majority of projects are developed on closed and proprietary infrastructure. Christopher explains how to make open choices with greater community impact.

This keynote is sponsored by IBM.
