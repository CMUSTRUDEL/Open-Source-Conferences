hi this is Mike Hendricks of mosque on

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,730
2017 in Austin Texas

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,230
I'm here with Christopher Edo

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,210
Christopher how you doing I'm good how

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,700
are you doing Mike very well so you did

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,009
a really nice keynote today and it was

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,139
really nice because you talked about

00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:18,359
open as an infrastructure and building

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,430
and using and deploying and open

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,320
infrastructure yes can you unpack the

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,779
different layers a little bit sure what

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,519
you guys are doing the thing that I'm

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,830
trying to get people to pay attention to

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,070
and think about is notice the

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,520
infrastructure around the stuff we use

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,620
to build open-source software and I and

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,910
I use the word infrastructure because

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,489
it's the kind of thing that we tend to

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,760
forget about so you normally you think

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,230
about power lines or water supply as

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,800
infrastructure and you you never think

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,449
about it until it goes away so when

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,860
we're in the building software world

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,870
infrastructure people usually think

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,789
about that it's just compute networking

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,399
and storage but I'm also I want people

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,440
to think about also that the pieces that

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,940
they need to build software so the extra

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,790
things like the repository management

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,380
and how they communicate - whether it's

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,750
asynchronous or synchronous the

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,460
platforms or software that they use to

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,320
do that so this is everything a

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,740
developer needs yes like there dial tone

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,920
for their job or whatever exactly this a

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,360
dial tone is a perfect way to paraphrase

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,729
it and I thought about doing something

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,290
about phones but I realized the chances

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,299
of people in the audience ever knowing

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,610
what a landline is probably half of them

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,600
have ever seen one so yeah yeah

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,220
so from an infrastructure perspective

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,710
where should let say a company doesn't

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,960
have a good infrastructure built and

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,240
where should they start and assuming

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,820
that they're starting with open-source

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,560
what is the easiest win for a company to

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,079
get going with building that open

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,909
infrastructure I think the easiest win

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,540
is to choose a chooser provider my

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,229
suggestion is that people look really

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,159
really closely at OpenStack based

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,360
infrastructure providers and there's all

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,939
there's a whole bunch of really good

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,320
ones out there and the reason you want

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,450
to look at that is because they're open

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,990
and they're based on open standards

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:11,480
versus heading towards the

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:14,270
the bigger players that are closed and

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,130
proprietary you run a risk of actually

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,420
being locked in and you have to jump

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,680
through a few more hoops if you ever

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,140
want to move off of one of those

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,000
providers to somewhere else and you also

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,220
you never know when you're going to run

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,630
afoul of something that that directly

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,670
competes with their business interests

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,260
that they might not want to help you

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,580
with and there's just things get a

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,840
little bit trickier when you're in one

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,220
of those big players in yours and you

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,680
can end up getting stuck there so when

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,350
you say provider you mean almost a cloud

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,370
provider and storage provider that feels

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,100
like you're talking about a business

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,660
getting started on the one hand I'm not

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,610
really saying everyone should build

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,250
their own cloud because it's it's a lot

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,500
of work and unless you have significant

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,390
scale it's just not worth it if you only

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,100
need a handful of machines to to run

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,680
your business it doesn't make a lot of

00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,080
sense for you to invest in your own big

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,430
private cloud necessarily but you can

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,290
invest in it or use a cloud that is open

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,790
to start with let's take another

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,280
approach here let's let's look at a

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,840
large enterprise company let's say

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,140
they're in the financial services

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,020
industry and their legacy built on all

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,240
sorts of hardware and kludgy software

00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,090
patches and stuff that they've assembled

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,340
together how does a company like that go

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,060
about transforming since we're using

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:31,580
this word transform I prefer to think of

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,320
this continual transformation and how do

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,060
they get started building their

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,020
infrastructure what what is the easiest

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,410
win for them large enterprise company

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:45,940
like that I mean I I don't feel like

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:49,520
there is an easy win I think that the

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,600
truth is big companies need to recognize

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,550
that they're not going to be able to

00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,160
forklift there they're not going to be

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,540
able to grab everything that's only oh

00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,810
this big mess and just put it on

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,290
someone's cloud the reality is you have

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,940
to re architect and it gives people in a

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,710
lot of good ways that the benefit of it

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,340
is it gives you a chance to rethink what

00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,630
you're doing and adopt some of the newer

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,790
newer things like container technologies

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,740
and my little services yeah micro

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,989
services and some of the orchestration

00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,880
around that which can make it much

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,850
easier for you to for these big

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,920
organizations to see the business logic

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,420
and see how it interfaces directly with

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,730
the different services and start to

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,080
break apart the old legacy stuff and if

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,790
you're taking that approach a lot of

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,860
times you can do that piece by piece so

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,080
you don't need to do it all at once you

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,530
can take you know a core service and

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,110
move it to the newer infrastructure so I

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,610
here kind of deconstructing the

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,550
architecture that you have and

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,860
re-architecting the infrastructure you

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,180
want to achieve exactly yeah it's really

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,490
a great way to put it okay

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,740
and in that does micro services play a

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,350
role like if you have a big monolithic

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,930
system maybe split it and then split

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,760
those and yeah instead of just creating

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,530
a bunch of micro services and hoping

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,350
they work yeah and then orchestrating

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,700
them yes micro services plays a huge

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:12,080
role and the reality is for a long time

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,090
this is the same thing as

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,700
service-oriented architecture so a lot

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,680
of lot of systems that people have built

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,980
can be pretty easily decomposed

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,010
especially if they started from an SOA

00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,740
place in the first place it's just and

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,170
and yeah I think it does make a lot of

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,610
sense to focus on small pieces at a time

00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,050
and that's that's oh they like it

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,180
instead of look at your entire project

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,060
saying okay this is the year we

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,520
containerize maybe not maybe this is the

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,780
year you containerize 1pp eggs and make

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,570
sure that you can still get to your data

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,580
and then start moving piece by piece so

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,260
are there any different industries that

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,840
you guys work with or are you doing

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,090
infrastructure internally to IBM or do

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,120
you help with your partners so the

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,590
structure as well so what I do actually

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,620
what I do is developer advocacy and I

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,810
joined IBM to help build clouds but then

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,030
I moved away from that and one of the

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,070
things that I'm really one of the things

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,440
I'm doing a lot of work with is within

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,440
open source communities and trying to

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,100
improve the way the open source

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,250
developers and developers around the

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,400
world perceive IBM I think we we have

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,940
lost sight of what matters in for for

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,760
some big parts of

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,250
messaging and we're trying to be a lot

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,810
more genuine and start from a place

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,390
where our motivation is to help

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,390
developers first not sell them product

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,340
not convince them to you know sign a big

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,110
check we just want to start by helping

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,750
developers so we're trying to build more

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,930
tools that that are useful and and

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,450
engage developers in the in places where

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,850
we can where we and we it has like me

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,710
and my team and all those who are

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:58,260
longtime open-source contributors can

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,870
help them and enable them to do things

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,850
better so if we fast-forwarded 12 months

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,370
from now and you look at your developer

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,800
ecosystem and how would you like to say

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,510
you've improved speaking about how do we

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,050
get them on board how would you like to

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,720
see IBM improve developers lives in the

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,420
next 12 months that is a great question

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:23,460
I think I would in 12 months I would

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:25,880
really like to see us and at a point

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:30,180
where we've provided a bunch of useful

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,100
libraries sample code and some really

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,910
useful tutorials and educational

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,250
material to get people jump-started and

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,820
I think if we continue some of the stuff

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,760
we're working on and developer.com slash

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,740
code a lot of that stuff it's still

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,110
evolving and we just we just launched it

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,030
a month ago but we're that's where we're

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,530
centered and where we're trying to build

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,440
a lot of useful things for developers

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,270
and so in a year I'd be really happy if

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,919
we had a bunch of useful things there

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,780
and people were saying nice things about

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,160
it excellent Christopher we look forward

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,970
