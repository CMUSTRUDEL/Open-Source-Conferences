hi this is Mike Hendrickson from office

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,660
con 2017 in Austin Texas

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,040
I'm here with Craig Hill Craig how you

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,260
doing pretty good pretty good

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,860
so you're director of developer

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,800
relations at sa P yep large company yep

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,130
and large open source projects I would

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,020
imagine how do you see enterprises

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,449
adopting and using open source and

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,330
including your own I mean it's been an

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,060
interesting journey over the last decade

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,570
or so when I first started in the

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,059
enterprise space open source was go

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,670
touch hands-off stay away from it's too

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,340
dangerous can't do anything with it and

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,809
then over the years what I've seen and

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,140
I've seen a lot of companies left just

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,149
sa P but sa P in particular has has

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,079
actually been at the core level of

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:55,079
several foundations Apache Linux Eclipse

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,989
and everything actually encouraging

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,030
employees not only to contribute to open

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,469
source but to also embrace open source

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,830
so you'll find a lot of open source

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,990
inside of our own company we we've taken

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,600
it to a level where we have a whole

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,619
legal process in place it's just and

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,299
I've seen this in a lot of other

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,520
enterprise companies as well it just

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,560
seems like SM open source is no longer

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,479
that evil thing in the corner that

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,610
nobody does anything with people have

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,650
come to realize it's it's structured

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,360
it's supported there's there's entire

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,390
communities and foundations bought

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,189
backing these things and it's made a

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,659
it's made a new way in the enterprise

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,079
space where we have a lot more

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,220
opportunities to get involved we have a

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,829
lot more opportunities for our employees

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,270
to share and to explore different

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,850
technologies and really come up with

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,759
some new innovative stuff so I would say

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,729
over the last 10 years open source has

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,590
just it's become more of a part of what

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,299
we do as opposed to this thing over on

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,579
the side so it's an exciting time and

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,850
are there some best practices that

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,560
you've seen that you as you guys use

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,689
open source internally that you then in

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,009
part on your ecosystem in your partners

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,799
we not only do we as employees have the

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,770
point place and process that where we

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,840
can actually get involved and use open

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,000
source we have a way to contribute back

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,760
we have a way to actually put projects

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,260
out ourselves and what we found is we've

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,380
actually worked together with several of

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,420
our partner and customer companies to do

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,730
joint projects together and contribute

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,319
back into the open source community and

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,300
one of the things that's been really

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,730
exciting for us is all of the

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,810
collaborations that's come about and

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,090
when I think about some of the companies

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,620
a little drop in names but as I've seen

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,720
look back on some of these companies I

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,480
think and 10 years ago 15 years ago

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,690
their legal ready this was like ironclad

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,220
don't touch and now we're seeing open

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,370
collaboration we're seeing open

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,100
contribution back our own open ui5

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,650
project that we've put out is a spin-off

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,620
of our sa Pui 5 which is the basis of

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,330
all of our web-based applications that

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,120
we now have a DES AP and everything

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,400
going forward and open UI 5 is an open

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,500
source element of this it's there's a

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,940
couple libraries that are not included

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,349
that's the only difference between the

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,840
two otherwise they're virtually the same

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,209
so what are some of use cases for that

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,840
everything it's a scalable environment

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:21,299
design for enterprise relational

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,329
transactions and databases so basically

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,790
our purchase order systems our supply

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,870
systems we ourselves inside of SA P I

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,810
want to do any vacation requests any HR

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,150
functions any you know expense reporting

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,549
functions we see you know interfaces

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,109
using our own open UI 5 which is it's

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,389
just the JavaScript framework built on

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,970
top of jQuery but it's really optimized

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,639
for data binding with OData models and

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,470
and just really enables us to really

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,079
scale out these applications so whether

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,090
you host your open source projects or

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,480
like open UI 5 is out on github yeah

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,310
actually yeah we actually we not only

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,930
have internal github repositories

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,120
available to all the employees for use

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,400
so we use it extensively ourselves yeah

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,350
we have integration with github inside

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,120
of our own tools so our web IDE

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,739
environment and our development

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,590
environments have integration right into

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,410
github and of course we have our public

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,030
github repository that's API out there

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,070
where you can find things and we've

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,140
actually built an entire tutorial system

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,330
and education system for our customers

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,870
and partners it's actually built using

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,520
git

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,620
so we use markdown language for our

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,780
tutorials and we have a special process

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,020
that actually takes these markdown files

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,150
and add automatically creates HTML pages

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,910
embedded into our own website so github

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,639
is basically just a it's an integrated

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,130
layer now for us do you see do you see a

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,800
difference with people using github and

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,060
using open-source writing better code

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,590
because they're pulling in they're

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,229
pushing in there they're more

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,260
responsible for that checking in and

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,430
checking out it's it's funny a couple of

00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,100
people that I was just having a

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,630
conversation with the other week they

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,570
were working on an internal repository

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,979
and they're ready to go with it and we

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,840
said okay well it'd only take us a

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,990
couple of minutes to pop open the public

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,669
repository oh no no no and what's better

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,160
you said it was right we want to clean

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:16,650
up the code first we want to make sure

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,770
when it goes out people see clean solid

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,419
good code dirty laundry with you know so

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,360
we've actually noticed that some of the

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,979
developers and it's increasing day by

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,280
day but we've noticed that they're

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,930
taking a little bit more pride in what

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,700
they're delivering outside you know

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,500
developers have always typically just

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,910
you know let's get it to work we'll put

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,289
our comments and there will comment out

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,580
if it doesn't work maybe we'll put our

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,919
comments and maybe we'll put our

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,599
comments in there you know in the iBot

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,520
space there's comments everywhere in the

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,289
systems but but as you look at it you

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,550
realize that they're they're wanting to

00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,690
put a little bit more effort into making

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,520
sure that they're following the

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,410
standards that we talked about so a lot

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,139
of companies talk about doing standards

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,849
and doing it the standard way and

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:59,099
adhering to standards but what we notice

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,599
is with github and open source they're

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,639
really putting a lot more pride and

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,960
effort into making sure they're

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,820
following those standards which is

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,260
exciting because it just makes for more

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,570
efficient programming so we're seeing a

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,720
lot of great progress made so you guys

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,400
are also one of the large cloud foundry

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,740
participants can you explain how that

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,340
works and well relationship there we're

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,870
on the board for cloud foundry the Bosh

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,389
cloud foundry stuff the past

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,490
certifications and a lot of it is

00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,889
stemming from the fact that our own SAT

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,990
cloud platform is based on cloud foundry

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:34,080
technology rs80 HANA

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,370
extended services advanced programming

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,800
area so when you do native

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,050
development on SAT Hana the extended

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,720
services xsa is what we usually refer to

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,660
it as you'll very rarely hear somebody

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,669
say extended services but basically all

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,320
of this is cloud boundary based nodejs

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:52,419
development cloud boundary based so if

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,030
you're a node.js developer out there and

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:57,310
you come into the SaaS 80 space for the

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,350
first time you know you hit our SAT

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,870
cloud platform you hit our SAT Hana

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,180
environment you'll be right at home it's

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,080
all the standards down to the mo file

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,699
and excellent I'm not a big fan

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,289
excellent so Craig if you looked forward

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,850
12 months and we sit down in Portland

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:16,600
Oregon or that's actually going to be

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,860
like 14 months because rolls in July if

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,419
we sat down to have the same

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,000
conversation what would you like to say

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,160
changes for your open-source curve at s

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,850
AP and would you like to see changing in

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,470
the market from an SI piece perspective

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,130
and a lot of this stuff you'll actually

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,650
hear about it shortly following Oz con

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,900
here in Austin we have our own event in

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,270
Orlando and a lot of announcements will

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,820
be coming coming out some of those I'll

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,789
get a sneak peek we're working very

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,460
closely with tensorflow not just

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,300
tensorflow itself but actually embedded

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,099
tensorflow

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,200
in our applications for the machine

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,510
learning deep learning area so we've got

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,190
a lot of exciting things coming in the

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,729
machine learning and deep learning area

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,919
that we really feel strongly that's

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,270
going to help our customers that we see

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,870
that it's going to help improve

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,610
processes business and it's an exciting

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,740
time I've taken a look at some of the

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,830
tensorflow stuff myself it's just

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,120
unbelievably powerful and I've looked at

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,500
some of the embedded stuff we have

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,300
already that we haven't actually

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,960
launched publicly yet but it's coming

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,520
and it's really exciting are we got data

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,590
scientists packed away in different

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,410
offices around the world for sa P who

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,120
are working on models definitions

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,039
algorithms everything to embed it into

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
our software so I would say 12 years

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,050
from now our customers are going to have

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,729
a just a powerhouse of libraries and

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,440
material available to them to just

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:45,040
really just change how they do business

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,900
and with how we're opening the stuff up

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,550
SAT Hana Express you can download an

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,400
in-memory database and run it on your

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,710
laptop and have all this functionality

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,930
right there at your fingertips I I'm

00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,970
hoping that I see a lot more integration

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,380
with the open-source community and a lot

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,100
more people who are maybe

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,960
non-traditional sa p p RP developers

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,210
that actually try out the software we've

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,490
seen some great stuff already university

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,620
programs Notre Dame Grand Valley State

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,970
University they've actually done

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,130
projects already they're working on

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,420
stuff so it's exciting excellent Craig

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,540
we look forward to that journey thank

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,540
you

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,029
