	00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:08,109
good morning everyone

00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,450
again my name is Asia I'm chief octave

00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,400
of cloud platform and far away it's

00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,879
great to be here I'd always come oh it's

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,290
calm

00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:16,630
I personally attend this conference

00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,820
couple of times is a great conference

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,550
for the software developers and for

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,010
technology leaders so today I want to

00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:28,269
share with you some information about

00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:30,519
open source in China and I want to talk

00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:33,940
about how important and the powerful the

00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:37,170
open source is to the IT industry in

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,180
China I will also talk an EDP day about

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,340
how way ourselves the role play in the

00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:48,250
whole open source community the whole

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:51,940
open source ecosystems but let's start

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,420
with things to do and you will go to

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,190
channel let's see next week so just go

00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,989
to any place that you have list of

00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,440
things you want to check out right now

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:05,610
for chan i guess is you properly try

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,160
those things can check out those sources

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:14,200
panda somewhere to say a panda they're

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:15,850
really adorable right yeah all if you

00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,830
find a place to have a cup of tea be

00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,720
enacted tea especially you go to sitting

00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,900
like a Hanzo where they have really have

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,660
a famous key over there or you just see

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,640
the cloud city and the experience the

00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,040
culture there when I say crowded is

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,690
really crowded city over there so

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,810
there's a lot of things to do in China

00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:37,630
but today one day you check out the

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,880
software industry in China according to

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,130
a survey by organization called Channel

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,980
Academy of telecommunication Research

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:51,070
and then survey as he made the total

00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:55,240
survey revenue in China will reach 1.2

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:59,020
trainings in the year 2020 up from 700

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,820
Billings in last year's 1.2 training

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,120
this is a lot of the bigger number for

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,850
me and more importantly is that certain

00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,940
percent of year-over-year growth rate

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:12,490
over the next four years in fact it's

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,880
next three years the total 15 is already

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,540
gone

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,070
right so the channel sovereign

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,990
Fumi and it's good news for software

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,790
developers and it's good news for you

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:28,420
and the past - so how open source server

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:32,470
is doing in China is great is huge

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:35,860
so the same survey also asked me reports

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,960
the open source software usage for last

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:43,690
year and this is a number they come out

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:47,710
as you can see easily that more than 90%

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,530
of customers in the survey say there are

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,570
currently either use the open source

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,470
software or plan to use an open source

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,840
servers not more than 90% this is an

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:02,440
incredible number you know when I first

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,020
look at them or my super surprise how

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,480
can more than 90% of is real this is

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,340
show that how much the software

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,530
developers in general of open source

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,340
technology is a healty train right now

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,560
in China

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,580
therefore the open source technology and

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,820
it's great news for others now part of a

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,940
reason that for this huge open source of

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,740
market can be attitude to some many or

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,980
open source of connectivity in China

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,440
next year in channel open source of

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,930
China are net they promote open

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,360
technologies they promote become unique

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,980
communic community collaborations they

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,400
promote the ecosystems globally again

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:50,010
these open source market is booming and

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,450
is huge in trains in China right now

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,480
NASA president is not surprised to hear

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,150
the company in China just my company

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,730
here in the US the company choose the

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,310
software open source technology based on

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,880
the technology maturities substantives

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,920
and attendant poor those are top 3

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,320
factors for companies to choose which

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,380
open source technology which open source

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,590
server to use and in some cases

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,230
specially for large companies the tandem

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,330
poor is the number one factors when they

00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,570
choose open source technology what that

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,430
means that means that you also have you

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,460
other reasons therefore many company

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,650
choose the

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,009
open-source technology this is awesome

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:37,210
this is a great now another incredible

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,470
number is here in this report is a how

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,080
companies implement open source

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,050
technology and this report you can see

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,620
from those numbers that about 80% of

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,419
customers companies that implement open

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,820
source technology in production for the

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,789
business through the partnership with

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,620
technology providers there is really

00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:00,770
good news for the technology providers

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,979
there is a gap between the open source

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,690
world in the product and product and the

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,449
production really enterprises read the

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,750
version of solvers so the companies that

00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:13,910
need help from us for all of you to make

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,030
the software to make the technology to

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:20,979
the more reliable more scalable and easy

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,889
to use this is where we come into play

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:28,430
and the open source is a top-priority

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:31,190
top strategy in hard way we are members

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:36,710
of many open source organization X Linux

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:40,099
car OpenStack saying save and open lean

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,500
if we in a spark so we are the number

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:47,150
one in promoting the contributing to the

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,889
open source technology and with I will

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,590
give a couple examples in that in the

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:54,039
field next slide but with open source

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,380
strategy which has a focus on two things

00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:00,949
one we try to focus on solve real

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,630
customer problems in using adopting the

00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,780
open source technology whatever that

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,880
means it means that we optimizer explain

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,710
the open source technology it may means

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,349
that we give a trillion to developers

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,440
for customers email means that we make

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:17,979
is that software easy to use right and

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,419
the the second we want to focus on is

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,400
the contribution back the communities

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:24,710
through the project we studied or

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,330
through project the community started

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,380
and we can rebuild both to the

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,659
communities so this is OpenStack evolved

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,120
listeners that are showing the role will

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:37,940
play in the open source community in

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,990
China so we helped organize the first

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,150
OpenStack they events in China we hosted

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,910
i box manage events and demented

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,770
trainees in china but the real story I

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,290
want to share with you today is one of

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,220
the custom we have channel more bad wait

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:58,010
help channel mobile deployed OpenStack

00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:01,160
deployment for the private cloud which

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,830
we believe is the largest OpenStack

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,020
deployment with four clusters around the

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,600
country managing more than six thousand

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,940
nodes and this platform the cáñamo

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,610
values for the IOT for the nav

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,380
applications the one of the you

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,570
quirements or one of the problems that

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,760
isn't is they want to link all these

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,560
four clusters together to be one logical

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,870
unit so they can control from the

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,240
central place to deploy apps across the

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,110
four clusters so we did a project called

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,480
tricycle that where we visited multiple

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,340
OpenStack clusters into one logical unit

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,140
because I can't solve the problems they

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,880
have and this project has been

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,180
contributed back to opens their

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,310
communities another example I want to

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,080
share with you is the kubernetes and

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,910
containers as I mentioned earlier that

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,700
we are one of the founding members for

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,730
census which is the foundation that

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:56,270
hosts the kubernetes project our

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,310
internal IT team is the force of is the

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,440
one of the first to deploy and manage

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,470
kubernetes and container in production

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,290
for IT applications with cloud native

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,510
architectures they were really these are

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,090
really cool binaries container in

00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,250
productions or what guiity guys they did

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,560
a very good job to were able to using

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,540
this technology to we improve the

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,460
explicit generation at long as you can

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,090
see up on this slide in some cases

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:25,550
taking the reduced number vein 424 the

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,830
same amount same amount of workload they

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,690
also be able improve the development

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,840
efficiency as you see from slides

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,150
ten times at the same time will have any

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,700
engaging with the kubernetes project and

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,560
then we contribute in the community we

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,510
contribute many features to the to the

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,060
community for this project including

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,670
Governor Phips federal regions resource

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,220
scheduling container networking and also

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,200
way continuity

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,950
working with communities in contributors

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,950
of project a lot

00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,990
now additionally also want to share with

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,510
three projects we are we initiated and

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,070
we are working with other companies to

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,220
try to contribute that back to the

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:09,490
communities the first is the current

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,190
data carbon beta is a this product has

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,170
to be already accepted as a top-level

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,200
project in the Apache foundation is the

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,410
index data format for SAS data analysis

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,860
both in SDS is the project abstract the

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,110
whole storage resource as a logical pool

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,470
so that developers can use and send API

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,090
to schedule the storage resource for the

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,010
application needs just like this

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,440
schedule computing resource for their

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,110
applications macro service afirma its

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,270
affirmative we use we build as part of a

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,250
platform as a platform well in the

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,720
process to open-source as a project and

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,970
hopefully they can field back to the

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,650
community

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,140
last but not least I want to mention the

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:53,140
project's core open lab the open lab is

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,330
a deaf cloud environment where the

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,490
variables you can sign up go there to

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,630
develop a path and run your vacations

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,250
based on the open API based on the open

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,130
based on the open source technologies

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,680
this is a really a unique way that we

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,140
contribute to the community by open up

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,310
those open open labs which already have

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,830
certain opted six more in the build and

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,650
again you the button there in this URL

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:24,160
you can go to the try is the way that we

00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:27,070
help promote the developer ecosystems

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:32,470
help to improve the debug experience

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:34,600
through tools through API again I think

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,210
that's all for me now one last word and

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,640
I like this word is working together is

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,770
far about winning together is awesome

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,680
thank you very much for your time hope

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,010
you enjoy the conference

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,010
