hi this is Mike Hendrickson from Moscow

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,120
2017 in Austin Texas

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,980
I'm here with Ying Chun from Huawei Yong

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,429
Chun how you doing good how are you I'm

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,099
doing well

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,080
great Jose you - so you're the chief

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,780
architect for one of your cloud groups

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,570
at Huawei yes I'm the chief alpha of

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,670
call platforms on hallway my current job

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,100
is a new responsibility was the

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,359
architecture of all paths probably

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,269
called platform-as-a-service this

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,359
everything form the mobile application

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,969
to the cloud including the deployment

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,800
monitoring and be for the developers so

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,170
as an architect you're probably seeing a

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,700
lot and people call it digital

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,870
transformation I call it continual

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,370
transformation because we're never going

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,440
to get to a point where your digital

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,600
you're just continually evolving and

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,399
transforming right you probably see a

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,379
lot of companies you work with and

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,980
including yourself going through this

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,390
transformation can you talk about how

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,430
architectures are evolving and

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,430
incorporating more open source in their

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,469
evolution yeah well you know I have

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,930
experience when I work about 18 18 year

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,020
Microsoft now a far way that all the

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,090
company that moves to a cloud era so

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,979
where in fact it's not focused on the

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,970
product it's focused on the services

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,580
which you acquire different

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,350
architectures and right now the

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,030
open-source architecture is open

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,850
technology that's where the train is

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,460
that's where help the company move the

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,259
traditional latest applications into the

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,229
cloud with the help of open source

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,360
technology but it's not just a like get

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,180
a big fork lift and lift up the old

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,909
technology and bring it into the cloud

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,829
your re architecting systems right

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,380
this is - correct big systems right

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,909
correct so yes you're right the worldly

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,770
cuz it's been so hard to change we're

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,310
having therefore many times and many

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,350
years now then you have to have redesign

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,240
some of effort kitchens so normally that

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,490
you want to start with a new application

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,920
that with cloud little architecture when

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,320
you decouple your older applications

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,689
into different piece and the grad only

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,540
one by one - mark great piece of that

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,520
into the cloud native architecture

00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,890
so it's declarative and job it is easy

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,379
to say about is very hard to do and in

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,640
you're helping your your customers as

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,239
well because you have customers around

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,800
the world

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,920
right

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,030
and they're all kind of dependent or

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,380
codependent on some of your

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,350
infrastructure you've already built

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,510
right and are they looking to you as

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,310
helping architect their platforms as

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,740
well there's a lot of cosmetic and

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,220
off-gas - definitely move to the clouds

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,350
and we we are leaving the cloud lady

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,390
transformation you know two years ago

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,970
that we started a project called past

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,580
platform that actually with the goal to

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,010
help the customer to move the quality of

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,320
architecture our internal IT highway IT

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,880
well the first one the first two using

00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,160
the container technology using the

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,740
kubernetes to move a lot of application

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,180
in TD cloud with reading assignments

00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,970
cloud leave your architecture

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,390
Microsoft's architecture so we can a lot

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,920
of based practice and we are inventing

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,570
this based practice to a platform we

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,990
call fusion stage it's a patched

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,430
platform that but can help customer use

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,190
expensive help customer moved

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,560
application into the into the cloud so

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,300
you're using your own best practices

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,340
that you've learned to transform your

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,170
company correct with your partners as

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,540
well and that's helping them right

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,550
become more cloud native and aware and

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,220
yes okay well done what is that what I

00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,890
can give is you know you need enterprise

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,850
now you will move to cloud lately if

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,860
you'll come to normalize your

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,600
application and it's not really take a

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,400
long time because all the applications

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,430
are integrated locator you're not able

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200
to capitalize all the application at one

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,700
time so with your they play with

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,489
features in their platforms called

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,130
hybrid orchestration and that were

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,550
actually support they're not only the

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,050
company as application also the oil or

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,360
negative vacations same move to the same

00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,620
platform which both contain a non

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,230
contain the components are being

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,880
advocated into the platform so you don't

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,260
have to abandon your legacy right away

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,030
you can you can have a hybrid

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,220
environment running right where you have

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,220
your new cloud infrastructure goat and

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,470
your legacy still operating in case

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,930
there's some redundancy or right like

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,459
we're concerned right yeah yeah yeah and

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,050
they all be all implicated ing paper

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,000
gave it and you work with highly

00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,410
regulated industries to launch you but

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,850
ones that are usually like telcos are

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,800
somewhat regulated on what

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,160
can do what they can't do and that still

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
works for them as well the hybrid model

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,820
yes well that's for the liquor

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,970
enterprise application well for in case

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:38,510
of tackle where a lot of the tiger

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,240
company is now moving to the IPAs with

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,000
the co ICT transformation the leverage

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,190
the IT infrastructure leverage declaw in

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,250
the Churchill - we've organized the

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:54,980
telecom communication errors but that's

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:58,940
where they the cloud latif the inside of

00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,800
the city areas so if you had to think

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,250
about in the companies you've helped

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,540
transform and get to be cloud native

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,420
what do you think is the biggest barrier

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,580
that is consistent among all of them is

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,340
there one thing that stands out above

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,490
others that is always a problem for most

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,370
companies well and that's a good

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,570
question and in the different customers

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,370
are getting companies there face of

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,220
different problems but I think a lot of

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,550
the apartment is actually the cultures

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,070
and the move for your applications to

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,570
the cloud require different men set with

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,890
quite different development process

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,600
we're quite different

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,390
you have to relate a much quicker

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,340
iteration step and some some companies

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,010
like Rajan some other problems they have

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,200
right and then the other problems will

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,900
have just too much naked certifications

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,420
it's really hard to change and this is

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,740
one of the problems that that some our

00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,840
customer have or some one company have

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,040
and you know you keep a knowledge

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,240
companies that you're talking to and

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,190
that's why it's a continual

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,960
transformation because I wrote away you

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,570
just have to continually iterate on it

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,430
and continue right you know the

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,250
technology is there for the business

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,960
benefit so even which house for the

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,090
students to call video architecture to

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,100
the cloud it has had some babies as a

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,720
benefit you cannot just you know throw

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,580
with all things and move everything to

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,970
the cloud you know why shark so you

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,010
basically identified the cultural in a

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,950
way legacy culture right you know that

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,110
that has to be overcome and you see that

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,620
more in different countries or Middle

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,410
East or Asia or

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,169
North America where are you seeing any

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,330
more predominant culture shifts for

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,850
people you know my person you have not

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,040
see the difference between you know

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,810
geographic regions and they are some

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,510
difference between the actual industrial

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,360
yourself like a banking and insurance

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,160
and all you're gonna get will be call

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,020
your company or government and they have

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,910
a different in the different stage of

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,389
the transformations some more

00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,160
conservative some more yes freedom it's

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,290
it's not a geographical boundary it's

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,389
not a bomb under the industry boundary

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,120
an industry legacy yeah that's the fun

00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,370
yes excellent so if you fast forward 12

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,130
months from now what would you like to

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,250
say wall way is doing different to help

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,110
companies transform and what I would

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,070
like to see the hallway you know a year

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,510
from now it's that we have a fundamental

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,120
platform in Australia they're the

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,120
reliable and there are four terms for

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,540
all our business not only that we call

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,550
IP into enterprise business but also the

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,350
telecom business because color time is

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,169
also in the middle of transformation

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,330
move to the cloud lady moved to the

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,130
cloud are computing architectures I

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,550
would like to say that our platform can

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:48,070
support both which is really a challenge

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,630
is because it's two different areas one

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:52,000
we require more regulation as you see

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,430
earlier one most Morpheus stars are

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,410
open-source words in there so we want to

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,229
use an open-source technology that will
