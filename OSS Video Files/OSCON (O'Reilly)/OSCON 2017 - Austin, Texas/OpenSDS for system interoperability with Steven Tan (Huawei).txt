hi this is Mike Henrickson from Moscow

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,069
in 2017 in Austin Texas

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,500
I'm here with Stephen tan Stephen how

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,349
you doing good so you're the chief

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,559
architect of open STS management with

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,450
Huawei and what is open SGS management

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,240
and why do people want to know more

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,850
about it so openness is especially an

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,180
open-source community projects folder to

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,240
address the challenges of the industry

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,369
for storage management when you when you

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,320
mention customers what you mean by its

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,290
open and what we can they do with this

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,380
so what customers can do this is that

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,559
when we mean open meaning that is

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,149
interoperable among different storage

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,050
I mean discourage from different vendors

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,149
and customers would be benefit to

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,780
customers is that they can actually use

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:55,410
open areas as a platform to manage a

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,710
heterogeneous environment okay so a mix

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,210
of all different platforms operating

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,000
systems everything yes

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,559
data storage different types different

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,170
different types of storage from

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,000
different vendors and be able to connect

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,310
to different kind of compute that form

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,020
and this is an open source project

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,299
it'll an open source project that's

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,490
founded under the X foundation and so

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,470
how do how do developers start working

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,140
with them so in github or where do they

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,200
find so open as this is available on the

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,329
github it's available at github special

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,159
open STS and we do have weekly meetings

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:34,229
for this project development

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,090
collaboration is covered by that and are

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,250
the weekly meetings in person or they

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,340
internet that's online online like

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,360
animating okay so you can find out on

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,030
the remaining days so go to the open STS

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,420
dot IO web site and then go to find out

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,000
how to go to joint open education and

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,310
why if you could think about why would

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,280
developers want to start using open STS

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,500
what what is it going to give them a an

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,789
ability to manage storage for

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,549
heterogeneous systems and

00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:10,090
actually the well proposition for

00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:12,250
developers instead to open STS there's

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,319
actually a common API for different

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,310
platforms and they don't have to like

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,540
write a different set of programs for

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,400
say a kubernetes environment versus a

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,040
OpenStack environment so they can so

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,220
with open STS they can consume storage

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,630
in a universal way regardless of the

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,650
environment and regardless of the

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,590
storage back-end

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,569
well it sounds awesome so enterprises

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,610
should love this - that I ones that are

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,500
trying to get their storage in their

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,450
management storage under control

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,579
yes actually a lot of customers that he

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,269
talked to so far I mean they love this

00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:52,390
project they'd be basically I mean they

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:55,480
they have this game point there and they

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,420
see open Sessa is a project that's able

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,370
to solve their pain point so if you if

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,680
you have a road map of the future of

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,040
open STS what would you like to see

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,280
happening in the next 6 to 12 months for

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,299
openness yes so open it this was founded

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,569
was launched actually just back in last

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:20,440
November so it's a pretty young project

00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:22,329
at this point in time and we the we're

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,299
still in very early stage of the

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:29,829
development but we do hope to have a

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:32,440
beta version of the project released or

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:35,560
by the end of this year this able to

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,260
support the storage backends about

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,239
OpenStack cinder in Manila and then be

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,450
able to provision storage for kubernetes

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,790
as well as made sort of a docker saw

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,190
that what we are aiming for excellent

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,660
some major platforms yes yes exactly

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,269
they were situated all automatic

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,540
platforms yeah so having to extend all

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:58,060
of them and for any industry and anyone

00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,269
with storage requirements right in this

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,120
rate okay it should work ok so if we

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,620
were to fast forward 12 months from now

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,680
and what would you like to say has

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,500
happened with the community around open

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,819
STS is it growing is it more active what

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,040
would you like to see happen

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,280
I should probably what we want to do is

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,650
actually focus on

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,590
Eco aspects of this to be able to have a

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,200
solid foundation or removal for this

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,610
I'll open a station controller and then

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,610
from there we want to build an ecosystem

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,790
around this framework so that you can do

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,050
this besides the basics provision you

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,060
should be able to think like

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,490
illustration and lifecycle management

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,700
for storage and so on that's what I save

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,390
a lot about and is asking for and we

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:49,580
have to also try to grow the project

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:51,140
into a more more mature kind of

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,820
organization such that we apply

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,010
technical steering committees and

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,390
governing reports and so on so we're in

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,240
the process of talking to different

00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,669
companies about this and we do hope to

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,940
like within the next 12 - be able to

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,080
actually have mobilized this project

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,030
excellent well this sounds like a lot of

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,790
exciting things happening and this is

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,950
based in Shenzhen or Santa Clara where

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,180
well this is actually a collaboration

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:19,510
between between water storage I mean

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,460
major storage vendors like the EMC

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,919
retouching Fujitsu versed in digital and

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,200
also in customers like waterfall so it's

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,820
not always on a project right alright

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,350
excellent really excellent Lee you guys

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,390
are helping lead the charge with it we

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,100
are helping I mean opening resources and

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,160
we're hoping the other vendors put in it

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,510
this also says also excellent Steven we

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,220
look forward to seeing how this project

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,610
grows and evolves over the next couple

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,560
years

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,370
thank you so much thank you very much

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,370
you thanks

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,909
