hi this is Mike Hendrickson from Moscow

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,120
in 2017 in Austin Texas I'm here with

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,950
James Ward James how you doing good are

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,269
you good so you're with Salesforce and

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,759
you have a really unique and interesting

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,290
job title you unpack it a little bit for

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,540
yeah so I'm the engineering and

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,529
open-source ambassador at Salesforce so

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,300
that means I get to work with our

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,010
engineers to help them open source their

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,689
software and then work with the open

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,369
source community around that okay and

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,660
you gave the talk yesterday and what was

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,010
the nature of the talk of what you

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,140
wanted people to get it's called

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,269
managing open source and large

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,640
organizations so we're a large

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,290
organization and we've had to work

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,840
through some challenges to be able to

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,360
participate in open source both by

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,190
sending contributions out by receiving

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,899
contributions back open sourcing our

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,640
projects so we had to work through those

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,620
and create some processes and tools to

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,840
manage that so I was talking about how

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,820
other enterprises can can learn from

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,430
what we learned and do more open source

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,590
so you guys in your ear journey to use

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,469
open source mode and to be an open

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,140
source community giver have learned some

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,940
best practices you're imparting those

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,650
best practices on people that's right

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,210
yeah yeah I think we all get better by

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,860
doing more open source so we all better

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,760
we all do better that's right yeah yeah

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,700
yeah

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,439
so what are some of the the most common

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,750
challenges you see in a large working

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,909
yes and try and you just even get going

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,729
yeah yeah it's there are a lot of

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,979
challenges because really what we face

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,840
is a lot of attacks in various ways it

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,030
could be legal attacks they could be

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,420
attacks against our infrastructure that

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,860
could be PR attacks and so there's legal

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,650
challenges you know we want to protect

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,970
our patent portfolio we want to make

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,250
sure that we're not creating an attack

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,420
surface for patent infringement those

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,000
sorts of things so there's legal

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,310
challenges there's IP challenges and

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,570
legal there's quality challenges making

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,399
sure that we're not publishing something

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,869
that's embarrassing there's security

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,790
challenges making sure that we're not

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,619
publishing something that reveals an

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,659
attack angle on our on our software

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,880
those sorts of things these are all -

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,280
open source yeah they really kind of

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,500
open up the surface area the

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,659
is out there for for what people can see

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,280
around an organization

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,350
so maybe unpack a little bit for me on

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,990
this one because security seems like you

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,810
know a main concern for a lot of large

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,300
organization wouldn't open-source make

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,209
it better it does because more people

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,220
are plugging the holes it that's exactly

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,709
right it is is there's a perception that

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,720
by opening open sourcing some code that

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,220
we're potentially revealing some some

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,470
new attack angles that people aren't

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,190
aware of but in reality what we see is

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,410
that by revealing that that things may

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,420
come about that that people are fixing

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,400
but now there's eyes on it and it's more

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,989
of an open process so actually it's

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,820
better to open source a lot of this

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,500
stuff because then we have lots of

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,269
different security researchers looking

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,000
at it reviewing it and that's why some

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:50,459
of the core security pieces of the

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
internet are open source like like the

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,160
TLS stack and those sorts of things

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,190
because then we get lots of different

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,690
eyes on the software so so yeah it's

00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,730
kind of counterintuitive but but

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,350
definitely works in our favor to open

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,030
source of soft balota more soft and you

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,250
also see a cultural shift needed in

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,049
large organizations to start using open

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,910
source especially large enterprise yeah

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:15,720
definitely there's there's a cultural

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,299
shift in in using and in contributing so

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,910
in using open source there's there's a

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,380
tendency with a lot of Engineers to to

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,670
want to build everything themselves and

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,860
think that they can do it better than

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,780
their predecessors and that's great and

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,390
we definitely need that but often times

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,130
if you consume open source and are

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,410
willing to contribute some changes back

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,940
then everything can be made better and

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,200
you don't have to start from scratch and

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,150
fall into all the pitfalls that your

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,760
predecessors did so part of that culture

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,049
though is the mindset of if you

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,420
contribute back there helping

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,340
potentially your competitors yeah so how

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,519
do you get people there they're probably

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,470
also helping you though so so it's a I

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,560
remember a long time ago I got to be in

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,940
a meeting with a CEO of Adobe and right

00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,950
at the outside of the meeting it was

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,690
meeting with another CEO it came in and

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,220
he said he said you know we're

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,049
Enterprise companies we definitely

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,150
compete in certain areas but we also

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,099
cooperate in other areas so let's find

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,629
the areas that we can cooperate in and I

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,510
think that that's you know open-source

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,730
is a good way to

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,220
look at that is there are lots of places

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,510
where we can cooperate and yeah there

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,340
are going to be places where we compete

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,430
but ultimately let's let's find a place

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,169
where source is the Nexus of building an

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,410
ecosystem that works for everyone that's

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,180
right yeah great so what are some of the

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,419
challenges you think you're going to

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,039
face in the next year or so with

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,470
continuing your open-source journey and

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,449
continuing to maximize the benefits from

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,320
you know your open source efforts yeah

00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:43,210
definitely so we we now have a pretty

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,860
heavy process that our engineers go

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,320
through in order to do open source so

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,630
this goes through security review legal

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,360
review and then an open source core team

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,310
review so many different reviews in

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,560
order to open source stuff and so what

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,470
we're trying to do is optimize that

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,820
process as much as we can and as we're

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,500
optimizing that process we're using

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,760
things like the to do group to share

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,680
that information and what we're learning

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,780
and the to group is sharing with us and

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,639
so we're trying to really improve those

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,190
processes for our engineers and for

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,600
engineers in every enterprise so as part

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,210
of that is improving the process is

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,490
automating as much of this as we can so

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,590
what we did just a few weeks ago is we

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,240
open sourced a tool for contributor

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,710
license agreement management so

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,539
contributor license agreements are

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,090
something that really every open source

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,590
project should have not many do because

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,750
it's pretty painful to manage

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,120
contributor license agreements so we

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,560
built a tool to automate yeah exactly so

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,599
when someone sends a pull request

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,610
through github to one of our open source

00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,919
projects we check to see if they sign

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,870
the CLA if they haven't then we ask them

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,090
to and this is all automated so bottom

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,919
to sign the CLA they sign the CLA and

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,449
now we have record of that and we update

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,060
the pull request to say alright this

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,800
pull request is now good and now they

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,720
can can be a contributor any time

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,130
without having to resign the CLA so we

00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,260
automated that part of the process so

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,539
the friction for your developers to

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,060
actually use and contribute to open

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,680
source you want to reduce exactly yeah

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,510
and on both sides so both as we're

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,789
contributing out and as we receive

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,500
contributions back yeah yeah so then we

00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,210
open source that contributor License

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,120
Agreement tools so what kind of tools

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,400
internally you use to help developers

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,080
know what's happening is a chatter or

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,510
what would maybe they yeah hey there

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,990
Chatham yeah so we do use chatter a lot

00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,820
so we

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,620
yeah we we actually use Salesforce to

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,240
manage a lot of our process around this

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,850
our engineers are in Salesforce all day

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,740
long and so we manage the process for

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,390
how we actually walk through the legal

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,280
review and the security review in the

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,750
open-source core team review and we use

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,000
chatter as a communication channel

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,790
around that so yeah that's that part of

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,110
the process so you're on dog food

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,060
exactly that makes sense right yeah yeah

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,360
yeah so what do you what do you see as

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,940
the main challenges for let's say this

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,400
whole industry of you know large

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,260
enterprises knowing that they're in the

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,390
digital transformation or a continual

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,840
transformation what is the biggest

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,330
challenge for large companies to get

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,690
themselves on the open-source journey

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,000
yeah so I think the traditional view

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,800
from executives is that when you open

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,220
source something you're giving up some

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,950
IP and we need to try to change that

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,370
perspective and and put value on what is

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,740
being given away and one of the ways

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,140
that that we've helped our executives to

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,050
see that is by doing open source we

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,550
create a new avenue for recruiting right

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,400
now everyone has a hard time hiring

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,530
engineers and so we can now go to our

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,390
executives and say hey you know this

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,920
really will help us find great engineers

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,270
because if someone contributes back to

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,620
one of our open source projects guess

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,900
what they're a great candidate for

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,030
working at Salesforce and being up to

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,440
speed quicker as well that's right yeah

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,390
so our executives have been have been

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,130
really supportive of those efforts and

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,380
that's great but I think that the

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,450
traditional view in business is that now

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,730
we need to keep everything you know we

00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,080
need to keep all our IP in-house and we

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,630
need to really teach them that there is

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,760
value and open sourcing software so

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,710
augmented IP of the future that's right

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,690
that's kind of an interesting thought so

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,760
if you if you and I have this discussion

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,390
let's say next year important London s

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,120
in July what would you like to say has

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:19,540
changed for your open source ambassador

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,280
group yeah yeah so I I'm really hoping

00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,230
to develop more automation around this

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,020
to reduce the friction that it takes our

00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,180
engineers to to be able to open source

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,530
and go through the open source process

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,300
obviously we can't remove all the

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,920
safeguards and we need to keep those in

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,080
place but we definitely can do more

00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,030
automated tooling around this and then I

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,910
think it would be a good sign of success

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,890
if we see other enterprises you know

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,780
showing up at OSCON like we have and

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,970
saying hey we are you know component

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,770
open-source and you know we're trying to

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,530
lead the way there but hopefully we see

00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,750
others coming along with us as we kind

00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,580
of have blazed the trail and showed them

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,200
that hey you know you can do this -

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,580
excellent James we look forward to that

00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,580
conversation yeah cheerfully Thanks

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,370
