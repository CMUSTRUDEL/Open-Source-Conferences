Description: 
	Open source contribution and collaboration: How (and why) Netflix drives industry engagement

Netflix has become well known for its contributions to open source, creating and contributing to over 50 active projects. But why the focused involvement in open source?

Dianne Marsh tells the story of Spinnaker—an effort that originated at Netflix and has become an industry collaboration between several companies, including Google, Microsoft, Pivotal, and Target—to demonstrate how open source contributes to Netflix’s success and vice versa. Diane shares how the cross-industry team building Spinnaker balances what’s right for each of their companies versus what may be right for the broader open source community, how important Spinnaker is to the success of the respective companies involved and why are they willing to delegate this responsibility rather than holding tight to it, and whether the needs of the bigger companies drown out the use cases of smaller companies.

	00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,269
so what does it mean to build a

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,980
collaboration well effectively I think

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,620
what a lot of people forget is that

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,210
you're actually building a remote team

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,800
at Netflix all of our engineers are

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,770
on-site in Los Gatos and so we're really

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,010
spoiled by having access to everyone in

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,770
the same buildings but with spinnaker

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,320
this really stretched a lot of what we

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,439
do in terms of communication because now

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,350
we are working with a remote team you

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,890
have to remember that I think in

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,110
communication because of that remote

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,420
capability is is really really important

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,680
so communicating regularly with the

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,840
other people that are contributing to

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,340
the projects with the other leaders from

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,899
the other cloud providers has been

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,410
really important in Spinnaker's case I

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,030
know Andy does monthly meetings with the

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,800
other cloud providers and also meet

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,020
separately with individual people and

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,629
companies that are contributing to the

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,059
to the software I think that that's been

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,680
really super important sharing your

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,929
roadmap being really clear about where

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,880
you're going is so important and I think

00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:10,920
all of you who build open-source today

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,319
know how important this is when you're

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,779
building across a an industry

00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,560
collaboration may be even more important

00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:20,939
because these use cases are coming from

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,770
effectively from big companies who may

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,420
solve this problem anyways we want to

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,740
make sure that we don't duplicate effort

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,369
where that's unnecessary and that we

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,619
combine forces where we can and so and

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,999
all of these companies have a fair

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,549
number of people who are working on this

00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:36,959
and we know that they can make progress

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,939
really quickly you want to make sure

00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,529
that they make progress together not

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,749
separately and building trust I think if

00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:47,880
the trust is so important in any project

00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:50,159
even more important in one of these big

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,840
industry-wide collaborations because we

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,599
don't have a common accounting structure

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,579
right and we need to build this fact

00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,520
that you need to be accountable to the

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,009
team you need to have transparency about

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,139
what you're doing and consistency and be

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,220
really sincere and committed because

00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:10,259
this is what reflects reflects on all of

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,829
us as the project reflects to all of our

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,870
continued work it is beyond that trust

00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:17,370
valuing input from everyone not

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,349
just from those three big companies that

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,930
I mentioned but also there are many

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,060
other contributors to spinnaker and we

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,580
learn from them too from the individual

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,650
contributor to target who put a lot of

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,090
effort into bringing up OpenStack we

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,950
need to make sure we value all that

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,980
input because we can and do learn from

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,450
all of those different use cases and we

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,670
need to make sure that we don't dominate

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,470
the conversation if we're going to have

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,239
an open source project that's born out

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,650
of an industry collaboration we need to

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,250
make sure that we respect all the voices

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,250
