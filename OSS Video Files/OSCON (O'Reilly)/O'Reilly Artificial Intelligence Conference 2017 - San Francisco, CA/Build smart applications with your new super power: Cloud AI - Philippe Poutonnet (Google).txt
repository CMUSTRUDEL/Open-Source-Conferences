thank you thank you very much I think

00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:10,670
you've heard a lot about Google you know

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,910
today and yesterday about the

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,400
democratization of AI what I really want

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,779
to do today is do two things with you

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,820
number one is I want to share some

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:22,670
numbers with you you know see how you

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,050
know we're doing was the I our customers

00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,849
are doing with the AI and how we are in

00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,930
the field of AI and the second thing is

00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:29,359
I want to share a little bit about our

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,450
experience and our users experience of

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,740
what does they do with the AI the first

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,170
number that I want to share with you is

00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,880
really you know how fast you know deep

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,310
learning is actually growing at Google

00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,620
we've used machine learning for pretty

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,150
much forever but this is really you know

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,950
since deep learning has been kind of

00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,600
like available and we've been able to

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,910
use it that we've seen this rapid

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,830
adoption inside and here what you see is

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,170
the you know the number of Google

00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,850
directory containing a brain model and

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,470
as you can see it's just kind of like a

00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,790
huge hockey stick and we're using it in

00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,560
all our product right now so this is

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,830
really helping us delivering great

00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,960
product you know one number I wanted to

00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,020
share with you is how fast this is being

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,450
adopted internally this is basically

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,850
smart replies is a feature it's an AI

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,800
feature based basically on helping users

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,660
using Gmail providing them a quick

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,580
response and a year later you know

00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,050
already 10% of our users is already

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,550
using it so you see when you design a

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,950
product a very simple product

00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,120
well-thought-through product with the AI

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,430
helping your users you know

00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,040
automatically to just jump on it and you

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,720
know use it very fast another

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,580
application of AI in the field of vision

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,770
one of you know my favorite one is

00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,260
google photos you know we move from a

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,600
simple photo you know repository to kind

00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,909
of like us you know smart way to use it

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,260
and I'll bang it being able to search

00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:48,380
and discover pictures it's really

00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,080
simplify you know there's this discovery

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,900
overall and we've seen dramatic uptick

00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,950
of this product my favorite one is this

00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,540
one combining you know many field of AI

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,510
translation you know envision at the

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,890
same time and really makes you know the

00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,210
life of our users

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,710
you know easier when they travel all

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,450
around the world and not being able to

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,390
see some of those signs or even read a

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,420
simple you know menu sometimes just just

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,470
help them so you know thinking about you

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,960
know a very simple way to

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,330
apply it and you know helping users

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,590
dubbed it the way we think about it and

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,230
I think we talked a lot about here I and

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,720
Ja talked about the data is really

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,240
thinking about the for kind of like a I

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,070
did a lifecycle and you know at Google

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,600
cloud we really want to you know provide

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,700
you you know with the best set of tool

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,130
from the ingestion to the storage you

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,670
know to you know running your AI in the

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,050
cloud

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,370
you know we really believe that the more

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,980
data you're gonna put at it the better

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,730
your output is gonna be so there's two

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,950
ways to do it really as just said before

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,900
we want to democratize AI we want to

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,090
make things easier for everybody so what

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,620
does that mean is we're working really

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,780
hard to provide you you know the best

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,790
set of you know pre-trained API that you

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,190
can use you know through an easy-to-use

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:05,360
REST API make a core in different field

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:07,370
vision speech video natural language but

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,730
if you know if you have you know if you

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,050
want of the privileged few who can you

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,430
know train and deploy and do your on you

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,800
know machine and in yourself we got a

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,660
full platform to help you do that claw

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,950
machine learning engine is really you

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,440
know based on tensorflow which is

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,269
everything we do inside Google this is

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,930
just a you know great way for us to

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:32,300
providing this I wanted to share with

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,400
you one of our you know great example

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,230
we've been working with Airbus I think

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,790
everybody's familiar with them and you

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,170
know one of their use case is a tag they

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,900
basically have satellites and they take

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,239
pictures of mother hers on a regular

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,459
basis and something they've been doing

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,739
for decades really is taking those

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,600
pictures and cleaning up those pictures

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,150
and what they're trying to do with the

00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,120
picture like this one is remove the

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,620
cloud and it's kind of like gets a

00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,239
little bit hairy to figure out which one

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,860
is snow in which one is cloud in this

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,959
picture so generally a human's been

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,280
doing that task and they'll be playing

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,989
with the eye and they'll be trying to

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,330
trend models and nothing's been been

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,130
working a few months ago we've been

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,810
working with them we've been develop a

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,190
proof of concept using tensorflow and

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,140
figuring out you know can we do that

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:20,930
really and and we did we've been able to

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:23,229
you know apply to an extremely complex

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,270
problem they've had for decades and

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:29,390
finally solve it this is something that

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,490
you know was not even possible

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,810
a year ago so what does that mean that

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,490
mean that you know working with this

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,870
proof of concept the tools we have in

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,850
the technology we have we've been able

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,010
to dip you know work on the development

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,710
time that was years before to like just

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,480
a few months and dropping the error rate

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,090
from like over ten percent to like three

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,590
percent so you know we really kind of

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,240
like at this tipping point right now the

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,880
technology is very bored with the cloud

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,960
platform and you know big companies can

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,960
actually do great things

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,220
what's more companies to you know I'd

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,200
like to leave you with three things to

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,850
think about I'm talking to a lot of

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,080
people who think too much about AI these

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,090
days I feel like I don't really think

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,740
enough about data and that is this and

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,080
there are processing in the preparation

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,030
I'd like to remind them of the basics a

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,320
little bit let's just not forget you

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,720
know the foundation it's all about the

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,100
data

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,900
spend more time learning understanding

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,370
about yeah I think you guys are over

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,930
here to learn let's all talk together

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,880
you know and talk to your peers and

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,790
engage because we still got so much to

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,140
learn of you know within each other and

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,940
common visitors are our boosters right

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,080
next door I'm more than a happy to tell

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,110
you anything about Google cloud platform

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,670
and what we can do for your AI if you

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,290
need to reach out to me here's my

00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,370
Twitter handle and more than happy to

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,550
talk to anybody

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,790
thank you very much

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,790
