Title: AI mimicking nature: Flying and talking - Lili Cheng (Microsoft)
Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - San Francisco, CA
Description: 
	Artificial intelligence models the real world around us, learning from social animals, people, and situations. But from where do AI researchers derive their inspiration?

Lili Cheng shares two examples of AI inspired by nature. In the first, Microsoft researchers created a system that uses artificial intelligence that draws on the way birds fly to keep a sailplane aloft. The second explores what makes people unique, our language instinct, and our ability to model how people socialize and accomplish work.

This keynote is sponsored by Microsoft.

	00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,940
thanks everybody so I thought you like

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,770
many other companies we really share

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,119
this dream that the tools that we make

00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,740
based on years and years of work and

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,089
research that we've done in our

00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,410
companies we can share but I thought I

00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:23,560
would share two stories with you today

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,470
and the first story is a project that

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,929
really inspires us by looking at nature

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,789
so I think there's a lot of focus on

00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,349
technology and we need to continue to

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,449
look out in the world and really think

00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:42,399
about what can we learn from the world

00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:44,680
around us kind of beautiful so one of

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,739
the first books that I reread was

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,899
Darwin's voyage of the Beagle and his

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:54,269
uncertainty that he had when he went out

00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:56,829
on this journey so life is uncertain and

00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:58,929
we know AI is just scratching the

00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,489
surface and I think as we scratch the

00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:02,559
surface we really need to think about

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,900
what's this concept of uncertainty and

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,170
how can we make sure that we program

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,909
uncertainty and infuse uncertainty right

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,590
into the basis of when we think about AI

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,610
so Darwin was really interested in birds

00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,049
he studied their beaks and how they

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,049
evolved and we've been really interested

00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:26,079
in birds - birds soaring in flight in

00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:31,180
air and other natural phenomena that we

00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,560
sort of take for granted every day the

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,159
other thing that we've been really

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,469
interested in is just land and air and

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,320
how small people are in this huge world

00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:43,270
so I'm from Nebraska

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,700
this isn't Nebraska this is actually a

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,149
town in Arizona but I just love this

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,630
picture

00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:52,990
because I think it reminds us of of you

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:55,000
know our place in the world and so

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,520
there's been a lot of Technology before

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,890
us and like I said this first story is

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,439
sort of inspired by technology that was

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,789
invented a while ago for planes that fly

00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:09,729
without engines just in hot air so they

00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:12,879
look for thermal drift and they can fly

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,220
autonomously by finding on thermal drift

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,290
and just like a bird they fly through

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,250
the air

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,160
and we thought this is a really

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,130
beautiful concept it's it's

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,370
unpredictable it's a challenge and maybe

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,040
unlike taking on a challenge of having a

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,890
computer simulate a game made of rules

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,260
that was made by a person maybe we could

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,960
look at some natural challenges and see

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,920
if we could really have a sail plane fly

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,770
autonomously modeling some of what birds

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,470
and other animals do in the air

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:51,760
that's just creating heat by the way the

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:54,700
Sun and land is formed so we wanted to

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,530
really say like you know what are the

00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:01,030
boundaries of software in the real world

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,250
and what can we look at other other than

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,480
just playing games again that humans

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,890
derived through a set of rules so it's

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,200
kind of a crazy challenge but I think

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,820
you know I can talk to you about a lot

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,150
of the tools we have but I thought I

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,860
would just focus a little bit on on on

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,590
some of the inspiring challenges so we

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,170
tried to make an RC a remote control

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,590
sail plane fly autonomously to two

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:29,260
points the goal eventual goal would be

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:34,239
that it can fly thousands of miles apart

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,209
non-stop using the power of AI and so

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,660
what what does that require it requires

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:43,180
that you can sense and predict and plan

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,350
a route and then of course you know

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,790
mechanics things like power management

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,090
computational resource managing those

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,330
and then you know just really reducing

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,130
uncertainty as you design the system it

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,200
also requires that you do things like go

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:03,430
out to the desert and wear Sun hats and

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,510
things like that so just just so you can

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,519
get a little background of what

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,370
sailplanes do they they actually just

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,320
ride natural sources of lift so

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,170
depending on the ground if you're like a

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,720
plowed field or the desert or a marsh or

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,669
a town you're gonna create a different

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,419
kind of lift and the sailplane

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:24,640
either flies or sinks based on

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:27,630
naturally-occurring heat that happens in

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,220
the air which is also affected by wind

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,180
and the kind of cloud coverage that you

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,720
have above it and so we thought could we

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:43,710
get a plane to find these thermal drifts

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,600
and plan a route to fly between them so

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,610
this is a picture in Seattle in

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,080
Washington State not in Arizona but it

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,870
just kind of shows you the computer

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,870
vision behind on what the plane is

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,610
thinking about and just and it

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,290
visualizes the thermal drift that you

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,930
can't actually see with your own eyes so

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,060
if we built a plane this is an edge

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,640
device so it's in the air and it needs

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,830
again to create an adaptive route and

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,260
control computation and this all needs

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:17,310
to be done on board I'm using very low

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,840
power and the batteries the flights can

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,640
last for a long time so we wanted the

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,910
batteries to be able to be recharged in

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:30,110
error and really rely on the AI to plan

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:33,570
its flight on the glider we have some

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:36,240
tubes until telemetry antenna we have a

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,070
GPS and some solar panels and then

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,070
inside the glider we leverage i'm

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,010
standard technology like servos as well

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:49,070
as long-range radar flight controllers

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:53,130
cpu very big battery things like that

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,800
and we base this on a Markov decision

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:59,460
process so basically in the brain of the

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,220
sailplane it's trying to determine am i

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,990
in a thermal lift what's what's the

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,390
probability that I should go from this

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,410
state to another state and what route

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,790
should I plan to determine where it goes

00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,950
and then it flies the plane and

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:18,240
eventually communicates back to the

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,820
researchers on the ground so the other

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,350
thing that we've done is we've wanted to

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,970
make all the tools that we make

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,280
available so if you want to just try

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,290
this out this is really more of our

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,270
bleeding edge research than you know

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,010
product but we always try to share this

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:37,620
out so this is a project out on github

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:39,720
that's really built as a plug-in to the

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,860
Unreal Engine and so if you want to try

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,540
some of these out if you go

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:50,220
try him out you know so what did we

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,470
learn I think one of the things that we

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,780
learned is like oh my god this plane we

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,740
thought we had the biggest region ever

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:00,360
we had a like an 8 by 3 mile area that

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,270
we secured out in the desert and we

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,220
found that this plane basically went

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,620
from one corner all the way to the other

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,600
corner in 20 minutes and we were really

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,780
gearing for a five-hour flight so we

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,440
were like wow wind and air it can work

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,450
it can fly and plan a route but but it

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,380
did it really fast so that was sort of

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,090
unexpected and as a result we were

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,070
basically chasing and looking for this

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,020
plane all the time which was kind of

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,580
funny and we really wish that we could

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,700
have better communication because rather

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,810
than like looking at your laptop and

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,070
trying to figure out where it was would

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,990
be really cool if we could just said

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,660
like come back here or whoa

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,970
where you going you know but I just want

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,160
you to put your place in the mind of you

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,700
know AI researchers where we're having

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,500
fun and getting inspired and taking

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,120
risks and hopefully all of you are doing

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,710
the same thing and hopefully all you can

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,740
take a lot of the tools and technologies

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,440
that we've done and and you know and

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,530
really push the scenarios so anyway I

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,950
just love these pictures because I think

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,240
AI hopefully will make us you know free

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,580
and do kind of things that are really

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,010
unexpected so one of the other

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,890
unexpected things that our Markov

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,990
decision process did not predict was

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:19,050
that there's this magnetic dust in the

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,670
air and it ruined some of our components

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,550
and so we never could have predicted

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:27,170
that the air would have qualities that

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,100
we couldn't didn't know about and that

00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,530
trying things out in the real world

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,010
basically sometimes has unexpected

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:37,080
consequences so anyway check it out this

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,830
is a really fun project and there is a

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,780
lot of research behind it and the other

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,000
story that I've been thinking about a

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,630
lot that relates a little bit to hot air

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,230
is language and so another really

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,030
unpredicted type of artificial

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,400
intelligence that really is based on

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,529
nature

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,850
in the real world is language and again

00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:59,190
I've been going back and reading a lot

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,420
of the literature if you haven't read

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,100
Pinker you really should look at his

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,930
books like language instinct and how the

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,730
mind works and he also cites Darwin and

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:14,230
talks about how language was not an

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,940
invented rule-based phenomena it just

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,650
sort of evolved in very unpredictable

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:24,550
ways so as you look at a I would say

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,740
really think about uncertainty and how

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,779
this is a feature and then how in

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,550
addition to unpredictable systems you

00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:33,010
can really combine them with very

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,620
rule-based systems so we have a set of

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,990
cognitive services and tools that you

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,779
can take and really easily combine and

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,300
create your own applications the

00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,740
language tools speech vision knowledge

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,839
and search a lot of these are just

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,450
components that we reuse for things like

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,770
the sailplane and then add to it more

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:56,170
advanced more domain-specific

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,540
applications and then on top of that we

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:02,050
have a lot of communication tools so we

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,450
have things like IOT and BOTS that let

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:08,620
you create language patterns to connect

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,510
a lot of these systems together and then

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,100
we have a whole platform of tools so

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,040
I've just shown you a few things that

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,680
the sailplane actually leverages the bot

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,610
framework the cognitive services the

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,650
adder IOT edge tools as well as the open

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,430
source tools that I showed you so as you

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,839
start thinking about building AI one of

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,020
the things that I would really recommend

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:35,020
is think about most companies have

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,350
really made these tools available for a

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,089
range of developers and I think it's

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,770
really cool to think how you can mix and

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:47,800
match and try different solutions so

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:50,230
that's kind of it my story of that

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,910
nature and I just want to remind us that

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,140
as we talk today about lots of

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:58,150
technologies the uncertainty and

00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,350
unpredictability of humans and

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,580
artificial intelligence is just

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,440
something that we should continue to be

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,500
inspired by so thanks a lot

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,500
