hi this is Mike Hendrickson from AI in

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,940
San Francisco and here Lily Lily how are

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,890
you doing good thanks so you're at

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,960
Microsoft and you gave a keynote this

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,179
morning about AI and mimicking the real

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,269
world can you unpack that a little bit

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,920
on a high level what it was about sure I

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,930
mean I think one of the things that's

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,820
interesting about AI is it's just

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,910
important for us all to think about like

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,980
what really inspires us so I think for

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,510
this talk I thought hey let's take a

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,009
step back and maybe share some of the

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,989
projects that we're working on that are

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,579
a little further out and that really

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,770
inspire us to think differently about

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,559
how we solve the problem and then if you

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,600
could let's what's transition into the

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,460
real world like that's further out but

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,410
what have you seen in the real world

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,450
with people trying to use AI some

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,579
interesting use cases yeah sure so

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,460
Microsoft you know one of our biggest

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,430
businesses is really housing companies

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,739
data that they have to do work within

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,300
their company and so you know we've

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,940
always had this business model where

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,040
data privacy is really critical and

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,680
groups of people that you work with is

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,170
really critical and getting work done is

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,510
critical and so a lot of those same

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,280
customers are obviously our cloud

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,630
customers are as our customers and

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,869
they're coming to us with these same

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,700
challenges that you know they have a lot

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,490
of data but it's very proprietary it

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,409
needs to be secure and safe and they

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,610
want not only to make the interactions

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,950
that they have in their company better

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,409
but they want to make how they interact

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,470
with their customers better so today if

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,290
you think about what company you feel

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,610
like picking up the phone and calling

00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,570
it's not a lot because I think we

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,810
haven't really done a great job

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,280
especially with big companies of saying

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,560
interact with us in a personal way and

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,659
let us make that experience great so

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,420
just for starters I think we focused a

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,180
lot on BOTS and conversation and some of

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,740
the cognitive services that a lot of

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,659
companies are saying hey this is a

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,469
problem for us and we want to start

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,880
really you know in the heart of what our

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,009
business is which is about reaching our

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,960
customers and how to make that better

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,090
and then from there you know we usually

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,530
say well you know that's great but you

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,880
need

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,850
you know it needs to work in other

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,060
regions that they work in each region is

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,490
different customers are different you

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,140
know how you connect with other secure

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,880
data the sources that you have is really

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,760
important and then also how do you make

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,930
it interesting and appealing and how

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,920
will your customers respond to AI all

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,660
right what are they going to feel like

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,300
how can you experiment as quickly as

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,209
possible with probably as low risk as

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,450
possible so one of the things I think

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,459
just the word AI is so inspiring for

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,250
people maybe more inspiring than the

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,830
word web browser or mobile phone equally

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,720
disruptive but I think just the words

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,519
make people think about okay what should

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,319
I be worried about like what's my

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,630
company gonna be in three to five years

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,239
and they could have already been asking

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,040
themselves those questions but I think

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,290
the term is making them ask themselves

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,250
that and and that's a lot of the large

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,040
companies that are in their

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,630
transformation they're whatever they

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,209
want to call it digital transformation

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,130
or their IT transformation they're

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,470
looking at not getting disrupted by the

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,410
disruptors who are also looking at AI to

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,230
to take over the large markets so we

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,660
have that kind of dual world going on

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,019
right now where and I like that idea

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,329
that the large companies are trying to

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,700
figure out what does AI mean to them so

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,850
for me it's been so fun like sitting

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,070
down and talking to you know not even

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,750
like the big huge companies that you

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,900
would expect but like you know we've

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,720
talked to Bank in Japan or the

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,329
government in Australia or you know some

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,370
automation company that just everybody

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,870
is thinking about this and probably the

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,180
way that it connects back to the talk

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,660
that I gave is there they want all of

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,799
this intelligence not just in the cloud

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,200
leveraging like all the public data that

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,120
we have but they want it like on the

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,100
edge right in whatever it is that they

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,810
sell and those devices aren't always

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,700
connected so a lot of the challenges

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,459
that you saw that are pretty far out

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,160
really with the glide plane is like you

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,230
know how can these run autonomously how

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,130
can they

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:22,400
just run no power self-heal how do you

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,620
update them how do they be run really

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,110
well locally or offline or in my data

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,180
center or just in my subscription not

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,430
connected to things and then how do I

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,280
make sure it can get update dated and

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,340
like improves because AI is improving it

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,530
seems like every day pretty much we

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,600
rolled new stuff out and so how do they

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,000
make sure they get the latest technology

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,990
or the technology that maybe isn't the

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,820
very very latest

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,639
but maybe has been proven and tried by

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,120
more people so in your example today the

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,060
glide plane that's not that far out I

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,850
mean you know it's already in practice

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,229
and being used so the way technology

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,530
moves so quickly

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:07,449
that's what six months out well I think

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:11,240
actually making it work for real safely

00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:13,699
four days repeatedly repeatedly I mean a

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,820
lot of the challenges it's some are

00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,380
probably policy challenges and you know

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,090
a lot of other challenges so what was so

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,460
cool about that is it made you maybe

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,650
think about well these things might not

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,840
could use power in a really different

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,400
way so they could be solar powered

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,990
they're low-power they're using the air

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,120
to do things so like just what could

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,380
that enable maybe it couldn't let allow

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,120
us to do lower cost you know I don't

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,880
need router it could allow you to do

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,800
lots of things so you know that

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,820
particular team is just really inspiring

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,800
because I think for all of us those

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,710
technologies yeah they're not that far

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,960
out really and they're making their way

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,360
really quickly back into the tools that

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,860
we make available to everybody so that's

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,229
been I mean Microsoft research you know

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,050
I was a Microsoft Research forever and I

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,940
feel like we're you know it's it's we

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,919
always had pretty much every research

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,720
topic vision and speech and language and

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,090
one really cool thing is all of the

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,919
focus on AI is really well what

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,479
scenarios all these scenarios need all

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,400
these pieces together so it's really

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,770
bringing all these groups from all these

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,570
different countries together so just for

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,450
me that's been super fun to have the

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,170
research stuff really be together with

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,300
the product

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,510
so what's old is new again and it's kind

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,540
of cuz AI was around back in the 80s mid

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:38,930
80s and it's now back here so you looked

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,400
out let's say a year from now we haz we

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,230
sit down have this conversation next

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,140
year what would you like to say

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,150
Microsoft is doing differently at that

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,000
time and what would you like to see

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:53,930
happen in the industry in general as

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,380
well for 12 months from now I guess in

00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:00,980
the industry for companies I guess I

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:04,520
would love it if they they really were

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,950
engaging us their customers in a way

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,670
that you were really wanted to interact

00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,780
with them all the time I mean it's not

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,490
and maybe some companies you already

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,770
want to interact with all the time

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,930
but a lot of them you really you really

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,070
don't know and so why do you want to

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,010
interact with the company I mean do you

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,300
need to like what what is that dialogue

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,980
that you're having with the businesses

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,210
all around you and it could be big

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,870
business it could just be a small

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,880
business so I think in order for

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,500
business to thrive and our hope is that

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,870
there are many many businesses in this

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,970
world versus two or three big giant

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,620
businesses that basically swallow

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:43,220
everybody else up because I think we

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:46,190
need that as a society we want we want

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,320
business to be healthy and governments

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,260
and schools and other organizations and

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,410
show in order to make that economy

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,840
healthy I think we need to think about

00:07:53,410 --> 00:08:00,200
you know what maybe have tech companies

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,260
learned to do that you know that we can

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,120
share and and give to everybody else

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,430
because for all of us I mean it's really

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,830
hard to hire like these AI rockstars and

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:13,490
you know we're lucky that we have a lot

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,800
of them but you know if you're a normal

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,170
small company or a company like you

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,550
really you probably aren't going to be

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,020
hiring a lot of AI researchers and it's

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,060
just really cool that all the big

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,980
companies we're sort of out there just

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,340
sharing what we have and I think that

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:34,250
that's really unprecedented and you know

00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,960
it's fun and most companies make sure

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,580
that the technologies can kind of mix

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,310
and match which i think is also pretty

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,810
neat but I think the addition of you can

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,010
own your data and your data can be

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:48,650
private is kind of disruptive for a lot

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,600
of cloud businesses and I think we'll

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,400
just kind of makes you build the AI in a

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,290
really different way it'd be kind of

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,480
nice if we could share that the

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,280
algorithm is not the data right you know

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,910
so that everyone can do better together

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,350
and make better AI useful for everyone

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,030
yeah we are hearing a lot of our

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,220
developers so we do the developer tools

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,930
and I think we have you know I mean it's

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,760
kind of amazing we have like 200,000

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,960
developers building BOTS and like you

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,420
know just who would have thought right

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,770
what do you know yeah and I think we

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,600
care that a lot from people like hey I

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,950
built these I had models or you know

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,330
with all of our cognitive services

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,520
probably one of the things that's unique

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,530
is we have these models but then you can

00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,690
very easily customize it so we're

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,880
finding that almost anything you want to

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,250
do you don't just want like the global

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,380
definition of a person or a place like

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,810
you have different attributes for a

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,800
person maybe based on what your company

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,660
does and you want to be able to

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,280
customize those models and then we're

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,630
finding people are saying hey I've made

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,730
all these customizations can I share

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,590
that with my team can I sell these maybe

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,450
but business around that and then below

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,310
that not just the models that you can

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,500
customize but can I make my own models

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,610
and share those so people I think you're

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,040
right on I mean I think we're going to

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,600
see that in a year where people have a

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,850
bunch of custom domains that they're

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,110
doing things for in speech and language

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,390
and vision and they're going to combine

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,220
those and they're gonna want to be able

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,380
to leverage and reuse that and you're

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,430
already kind of starting to see it but

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,500
it would be really cool if we made sure

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,720
that those can interoperate in some way

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,000
so that you're not having to say but

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,190
yeah but I started with this tool so now

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,680
I can't I really can't port those around

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,850
yeah excellent so twelve months from now

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,890
we'll sit down and we'll check in and

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,670
see how things have gone yeah thank you

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,670
so much thank you

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,050
