Title: Fireside chat with Naveen Rao and Steve Jurvetson
Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - San Francisco, CA
Description: 
	Naveen Rao is the vice president and general manager of Intel’s artificial intelligence products group. Naveen’s fascination with computation in synthetic and neural systems began around age nine when he began learning about circuits that store information and encountered the AI themes prevalent in sci-fi at the time. He went on to study electrical engineering and computer science at Duke, but continued to stay in touch with biology by modeling neuromorphic circuits as a senior project. After studying computer architecture at Stanford, Naveen spent the next 10 years designing novel processors at Sun Microsystems and Teragen, specialized chips for wireless DSP at Caly Networks, video content delivery at Kealia, Inc., and video compression at W&W Comms. After a stint in finance doing algorithmic trading optimization at ITG, Naveen was part of the Qualcomm’s neuromorphic research group leading the effort on motor control and doing business development. Naveen was the founder and CEO of Nervana (acquired by Intel), which brings together engineering disciplines and neural computational paradigms to evolve the state of the art and make machines smarter. Naveen holds a PhD in neuroscience from Brown, where he studied neural computation and how it relates to neural prosthetics in the lab of John Donoghue.

what excites you the most over the next

00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:09,820
five or ten years well I think as a

00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:12,190
society kind of solving this car curve

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,280
problem re continuing to to bring

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,340
together more data and drive better

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,660
insights right I mean you know in in I

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,060
think even in my own lifetime you've

00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,550
seen a shift in science go from an

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,560
individual you know looking at data and

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,360
and writing a paper and you know being a

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,310
super genius sitting in a corner to

00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,690
science today it's very different right

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,280
it's a very collaborative effort we

00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,109
don't have that anymore we have one

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,269
smart smart person sitting in the corner

00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:39,370
making breakthroughs now it's like you

00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:41,949
know sharing knowledge sharing data and

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,789
I think this is the trend we have to get

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:46,899
better at Ohio and and that's the way

00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,980
we're actually going to drive science

00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,620
foreigner and increase our understanding

00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,449
you mentioned you know coming up with

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,760
new physics to understand better how

00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:57,129
quantum computers work I mean this is

00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,879
going to be massive observations around

00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,260
the globe

00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,510
millions of people working on these

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,889
problems combining those results and the

00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,889
