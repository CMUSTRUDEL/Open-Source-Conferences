	00:00:00,339 --> 00:00:06,320
thanks for joining me here so one thing

00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:09,919
I'm gonna tell you today is not how cool

00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,999
things are but how cool things can be so

00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,240
I'm gonna take you through a brief

00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:17,179
journey from the consumer space to the

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,460
enterprise space so it's really about

00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:22,699
engineering the future of AI for

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,189
enterprises as we move from what we call

00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:29,630
the perceptual AI world to really the

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:32,419
enterprise AI world so I think everybody

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,489
will agree nature is phenomenal by every

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:37,600
means and if I didn't give you the clue

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:40,219
of the top middle part of that picture

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,129
people will have hard time really

00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:46,280
describing it and I think yes perceptual

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:48,140
AI has come to a point that yes I think

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,600
visual recognition software's can nail

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,190
it and yes they can nail that's a stick

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,690
insect and yes they can nail yes

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,289
obviously that's how olive green color

00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:01,460
as well but really getting to enterprise

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:05,119
AI is beyond this kind of cool and also

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:08,360
it is really beyond this kind of cool as

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,640
well where you know a blue board sitting

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,070
on the side of a building a green bird

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,530
sitting on top of a bowl and a woman

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,509
sitting on a table one could argue she's

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,390
not sitting on the table but sitting by

00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:23,210
the table and the giraffe peeking its

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,009
neck from the window which is a

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,159
black-and-white picture but it's very

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:29,030
hard to caption in general so yes that

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,030
is impressive

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,149
however the word of Enterprises is

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,520
really beyond that as well it's lot more

00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:41,630
than giraffes and birds and boats and so

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,549
on so this is a well-known example I

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,229
think popularized by fearfully at

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:50,899
Sanford a phenomenal work one of the key

00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:54,680
interpret enterprises tenant says you

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:58,610
know I cannot take my data and get it to

00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,289
50,000 workers in 167 countries you may

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,649
imagine I may have a slight problem

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:05,329
taking the data I have and really

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,759
crowdsourcing it out to that kind of

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:10,070
numbers because the data cannot leave

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,050
the enterprise's that's the first one it

00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,280
cannot leave the enterprise compute and

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,560
the second one is really even

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,470
if it can leave the enterprise compute

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,110
there is there not enough skills in the

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,870
world for that kind of deep knowledge

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,300
worker thinking to be able to outsource

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,230
and crowdsource that data labeling

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:35,370
problem in general so this leads me to

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,010
the you know Big Labor Data overlords so

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,709
the journey we are on that you see Lord

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,560
narrative out there is you know Alex net

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,959
VG net Google net ResNet and you keep

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,800
these so let's pop up some more layers

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,720
on to it

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,180
impressive work very impressive work

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,950
however soon you don't get a get to you

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,560
know a million layers I'm just

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,440
projecting ourselves out there however

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,709
that gives rise to another phenomenon

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,160
deep neural networks need massive amount

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,310
of data not just data but label data

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,100
actually interestingly no enterprises

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,890
have infinite amount of data however the

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,890
amount of label data is very hard to

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,670
come by and therein lies a significant

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:23,220
problem for enterprise AI which is

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,590
enterprise AI is not about really

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,260
learning from big data but it's really

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,470
learning from small data very similar to

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,840
you know as we learn as humans when we

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,260
were infants it's really know when I

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,900
when I had my children she was three

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,209
sixteen now when she was a child at best

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,209
I have two books no two or three books

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,609
C's for cat B's for boy is for Apple and

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,170
you iterate that over and over again and

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,760
sooner you know you know show her

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,739
another picture of a cat she has never

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,280
seen before and she is gonna say in her

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,970
cute voice that's a cat now geoff hinton

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,970
more recently said we we clearly don't

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,910
need all the label data I would actually

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,100
project one step further and say yes we

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,609
clearly don't need all that label data

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,340
and we clearly don't have all that label

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,049
data also so I would just change couple

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,359
of words in that sentence and say we

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,959
clearly don't have all that label data

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,270
and enterprises therein lies the

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,000
fundamental techniques we deploy and are

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,110
constrained by an enterprise AI which is

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,479
not about learning

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,639
from big data but really learning smoke

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,680
from small data and techniques like

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,810
transfer learning few short learning and

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,080
as you project forward one short

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:43,229
learning as well so therein lies you

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,960
know the what I call labeling 101 so

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:48,210
there's a headache you have of you know

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,789
massive amount of labels that you need

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,370
to generate in particular you can look

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:56,300
in verticals industry verticals you talk

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:59,219
about health care insurance accounting

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,979
consulting manufacturing telecom retail

00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:04,590
natural resources and the kind of areas

00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,620
you deal with in enterprise AI is really

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,340
about regulatory compliance obligation

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,139
extraction risk assessment

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,210
conversational discovery now take one of

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,550
our key clients as an example who is

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,740
trying to do risk assessment and trying

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,650
to label data are you gonna take that

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,680
data and test send it to 167 countries

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,259
worldwide even if that data could go out

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,210
there are few people in the enterprise

00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,599
themselves who actually can label that

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,879
data that data cannot go out first of

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:38,279
all for privacy reasons second even if

00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,740
that could go out it cannot be labeled

00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,719
by someone just crowd so in living in

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,940
the crowdsourcing world the skills are

00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:47,990
high enough to for date that data to be

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,819
labelled really inside the enterprise's

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:54,210
second one there is actually a key

00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:57,599
language of enterprises now one would

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,150
argue okay what is that language and we

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,729
have seen this client after client that

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,180
language of enterprise is boring old

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:08,909
PDFs now by some measure they are

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,639
roughly speaking 2.5 trillion PDFs in

00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:14,370
the world one would ask why the heck is

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,349
it so hard to interpret a PDF it's

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,469
interesting so many of you may have done

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:21,719
your mortgage so what happens when you

00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:24,029
do go through a mortgage process there's

00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:26,819
a digitized PDF your loan officer prints

00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:29,219
the documents they have you sign it what

00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,620
happens after that they at least scan

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,580
the documents what happens to scan

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,889
documents they actually become pixelized

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,529
now it's not too hard to interpret text

00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,000
in a pixelize document it's actually

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,730
bloody hard

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,880
interpret tables in a pixelize document

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,220
it's even harder to interpret graphs in

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,130
a pixelized documents and the kind of

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,010
knowledge we deal with is exactly that

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,320
kind of knowledge it's damn easy for me

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,810
to recognize cats dogs you name it at

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,210
Lee 22,000 categories or pictures it's

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,630
really easy for me how do you interpret

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,730
a table in a scan PDF documents that's

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,710
really the kind of space we are talking

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,770
about from the space you deal in

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,169
perceptual ai and and consumer ai to the

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,510
to the space you deal where the language

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:21,690
of the enterprise's really captured by

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,669
to almost 70 percent in scan PDF

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,560
documents and that's the knowledge you

00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,419
need to extract that's the knowledge you

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,250
need to reason on that's the knowledge

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,060
you need to teach and that's the

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,590
knowledge you need to learn from as well

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,890
there's another problem v of enterprise

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:41,190
AI i'll call it reasoning challenge so

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,780
interestingly current methods cannot

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,910
make sense of the world without the help

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,910
of very big amount of label data we just

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,880
talked about it the second one is really

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,940
we know that research has researchers

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,440
have a limited insight into why

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,210
state-of-the-art newland methods make

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,760
particular decision let me illustrate

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,880
that with a very simple example again

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,310
let's take you know loans as an example

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,020
so I let's say you are in the market of

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,000
buying a house you really you know you

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,400
and your wife search around a lot you

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,830
finally find the house you love you know

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,290
you fight you figure out you're in Baria

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,840
you figure out honey I don't have enough

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,479
money okay what are you gonna do first

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,520
thing you go to the loan officer say can

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,290
I have some lawn well if you're lucky

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,970
you're gonna get some loan and if you

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,470
were 5 years back everybody's gonna get

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,130
a loan or eight years back everybody's

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,690
gonna get a loan and you know you apply

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,760
the loan officer calls you a week later

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,789
say mr. Puri your mortgage has been

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,380
denied what is the first word out of my

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,330
mouth why and and you know the loan

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,520
officer is really cute and he's you know

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,290
sent he's looking at the screen and it

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,459
was a damn deep learning model giving

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,010
them you know why yes or no and he looks

00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,290
at the screen and says because and this

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,780
the geeky joke because the machine

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:05,700
learning vector lambda is less than the

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,830
threshold of 0.5 you know and and the

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,980
section void of your out of your mouth

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,380
will be why so I think therein lies the

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,290
problem of enterprises it is not

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:21,000
sufficient enough to tell me what it is

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:23,850
it is critical for you to tell me why

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,430
that is the case in fact enterprises are

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,200
riddled with processes just get over it

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,360
they are not gonna change for your dam

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,430
algorithm you got to adapt to their

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,070
processes and therein lies the problem

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,200
of you know if you're if you make a

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,120
certain decision your boss asks you you

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,340
know finally something god forbid

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,320
something goes wrong your boss finally

00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,020
asks you why did you make that decision

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,120
you know you say that computer told me

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,310
so it's a you idiot you are the one who

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,410
took that decision so again it's

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,960
important for us to really focus on

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,940
those two set of problems it is not

00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,440
about learning from big data it is

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,390
learning from small data because I'm

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,160
sorry we don't have it and the second

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,170
one is the why engine I'm gonna talk a

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,060
lot about that deep detailed case

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,830
studies as we move on I have a session

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,780
later on as well where we will discuss

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,600
detail client case studies in this as

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,310
well but more importantly I'll end with

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,470
this particular joke which I love

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,610
actually it's not about teaching

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,650
machines with small data for AI but it's

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,710
really about teaching teaching machines

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,900
with smaller data that can explain you

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,730
why it's a joke on linear algebra which

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,910
most of you will appreciate thank you

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,020
very much

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,020
