Title: Deep learning to fight cancer: Fireside chat - Peter Norvig (Google), Abu Qader (GliaLab)
Publication date: 2017-09-20
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - San Francisco, CA
Description: 
	Abu Qaderâ€™s personal experience is a testament to the increasing impact and accessibility of AI technology. As a high school student, he taught himself machine learning using open online resources and launched an AI company for breast cancer diagnostics. Peter Norvig sits down with Abu to share anecdotes, discuss the state of artificial intelligence, and explore where things are heading.

	00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,950
how do you evaluate how well your models

00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:09,550
doing and compare that to others yeah so

00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,730
in healthcare it's not just accuracy

00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,650
that you can use to really build out you

00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,869
know how you know build out metrics as

00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,249
to how well your models are doing you

00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,679
need to look at sensitivity and

00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:23,409
specificity and understand you know how

00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,499
close is the model to detecting the

00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:28,239
bounding box of the tumor when you know

00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:29,529
versus the actual right the actual

00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,539
coordinates are actual coordinate

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,610
locations because if you if you get it

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,170
just a bit off right if that you know

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,150
that 1% decrease in sensitivity

00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,850
specificity that's enough to impact

00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,280
thousands of people in a negative manner

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,510
and so a lot of the metrics that you

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,330
know I use and that we're using right

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,490
now deal with you know how accurate are

00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,230
they in the sense that how close are

00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,880
they to actually telling us where these

00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,090
tumors are where are they located what

00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,560
are they so yeah accuracy isn't enough

00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,320
when it comes to medicine just because

00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,750
the impact in healthcare especially with

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,960
AI is so much more massive so that you

00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,479
know a 1% increase in accuracy or its

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,859
best fittings and and sensitivity that's

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,090
you know that's it's a thousand people

00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:12,090
that could be affected

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,799
