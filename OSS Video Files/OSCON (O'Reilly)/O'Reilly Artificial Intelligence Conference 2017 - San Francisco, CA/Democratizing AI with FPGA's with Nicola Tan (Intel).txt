	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,929
hi this is Mike Hendrickson from the AI

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,879
conference in San Francisco

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,280
I'm here with Nicola from Intel Nicola

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,080
how you doing great nice to be here how

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,460
was the event been to Peru so far it's

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,389
been pretty exciting I think you know

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,799
there were some great speakers this

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,210
morning it was really fun to see Ann

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,949
jury and kind of go up there and do a

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,020
little chalkboard talk and give everyone

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,970
a good lecture i think as a good

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,550
professor does yeah Andrew from Coursera

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,150
right absolutely yeah yeah so you're

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,250
with the Intel and you guys have AI

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,050
everywhere we do so you know there was a

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,730
same a couple years ago software is

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,890
evening the world it's probably really

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,690
AI eating the world nowadays it seems

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,790
like it doesn't it yeah and can you talk

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,160
a little bit about how Intel's AI

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,989
programs are working yeah so I mean

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,480
Intel has really the world's leading

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,760
portfolio of AI products we spend

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,640
everything from Zeon's in the cloud and

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,920
data center all the way to move idiots

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
vision processing units that are these

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,109
low-power vision compute networks that

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,640
you can fly in drones and so we really

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,710
span everything from the edge to the

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,510
cloud and that's really important

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,570
because you know there's not a single

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,159
one-size-fits-all solution for AI every

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,840
customer has different needs and there's

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,070
so many different ways about deploying

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,540
it there's so many different

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,820
applications that they all require

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,020
different types of solutions and so our

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,790
approach is really to have a whole

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,500
portfolio of solutions to to really

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,150
address all of our customers needs and

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,939
so today you guys also announced

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,490
something about be able to try your AI

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,979
stuff in your free cloud or yes so we

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,579
have various cloud platform is to look

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,110
at something the DEF CON yeah yeah I

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,520
can't speak too much about that it's it

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,720
just got announced so even I think cress

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,299
Intel we're all still learning about it

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,130
but it's pretty exciting new new

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,200
programs really want to democratize AI

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,390
so that you know people all over the

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,000
world can can use it and really realize

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,950
its applications so Intel you're you're

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,200
from the hardware layer but you're all

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,720
the way through the stack in your AI

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,390
offerings is that so from the chip

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,350
that's a little AG all that all the way

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,759
up through yeah so I mean from our FPGA

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,670
so I work in the programmable solutions

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,469
group and so we look at FPGAs which are

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,349
field programmable gate arrays so those

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,980
are programmable chips so at that level

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,080
you can really design your circuitry to

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,450
that your specific algorithms and AI

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,580
needs you know we also obviously have

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,519
our CPUs which offer the most flexible

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,950
applications of AI and then we work with

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,420
our own software developers and software

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,489
developers around the world to optimize

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,890
software applications all the way up the

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,470
stack so that you can use all kinds of

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,260
AI frameworks and it's optimized for all

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,500
of our different types of silicon and

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,900
applications are you seeing any

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,480
interesting industry trends towards

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,599
who's using FPGAs you know traditionally

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,360
FPGAs are really used by a couple types

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,269
of segments people like military who

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,410
have very custom applications and so now

00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,299
we're starting to see a lot of growth

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,510
than in the data center which is really

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:03,109
exciting by applying FPGAs to a data

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:06,620
center you can get really scale your

00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:08,769
your your growth your applications get

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,349
really high throughput really high

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:14,060
bandwidth and energy efficiency and so

00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:16,280
you know Microsoft's a really great

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,620
example of this a few weeks ago they

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,840
just announced their brain wave project

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,269
and so they were able to eke out 40

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,419
teraflops of performance on our static

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:28,549
sten FPGAs which is pretty mind-blowing

00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,440
and they're not done so they're actually

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,389
have a roadmap to 90 teraflops on that

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,010
same piece of hardware and that's a

00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,180
really interesting application of how

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,010
they're using FPGAs

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,410
by they're actually getting that

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,880
performance by using new data types so

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,639
they're actually using that flexibility

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,440
of the FPGA to get the exact level

00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,450
performance they need and accuracy they

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,519
need and drive really high levels

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,099
performance so the people in the future

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,859
that want to design a system that's

00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,579
real-time you know basically real-time

00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,930
streaming data that's informing an AI

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,579
something FPGAs could be right in the

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,829
middle to help accelerate that process

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:06,590
quicker absolutely I mean that is really

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,660
one of the best performance benefits of

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,519
FPGAs as we're really great at low

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,609
latency applications so we can run

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,729
things as fast as anything and so for

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,780
applications like autonomous driving you

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,280
know where car has to make a

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,289
split-second decision or split

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,210
microsecond decision as to what to do

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:26,030
based on all these different sensor

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,830
inputs you know FPGAs can really provide

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,349
that really fast

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,240
type of processing you'll even see it in

00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:33,280
things like smart home applications and

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,349
we have all of these smart speakers I

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,939
could speak to and you don't want it to

00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:39,400
wait you know several seconds for it to

00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:41,169
figure out okay what is it saying how do

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,090
I respond you know the faster that

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,770
response time is the more natural that

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,139
interaction is and that's when we will

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,870
start to really see you know that growth

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,969
of that technology and FPGAs are really

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,289
great in kind of handling that and

00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:55,740
running it very quickly at a very low

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:58,479
latency I would also like some sort of

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,240
thing to make sure that those smart home

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,819
devices don't always turn on when I just

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,349
say a name that sounds familiar they're

00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:07,479
getting smarter every day yeah they are

00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:11,319
they are so what do you see is the

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,389
future for AI at Intel and when I say

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,430
the future that probably means three to

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,889
six months yeah it is moving fast right

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,370
yeah um I mean I think we're just gonna

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,889
see a continued growth of applications I

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,419
mean I think if you look at deep

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,219
learning and AI you know the last few

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,680
years been really focused on image

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:32,440
applications and image recognition we're

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,690
moving towards speech there's goods and

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,400
emotions yeah I saw that this morning

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,039
and then we're start to see more

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,349
reinforcement learning and robotics so I

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,750
mean really the sky's limit I think that

00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:45,430
just the way that we've seen computing

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,419
take over the world like you mentioned

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,370
you know software taking over the world

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:51,069
I think AI can be really applied to

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,800
every industry out there and if you

00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:55,839
could apply AI to any industry or any

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,509
problem in the world that you could

00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,819
solve with AI what would you tackle I

00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,949
mean I think one of the most interesting

00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,629
ones is healthcare right we have so much

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,610
data that's starting to come in now we

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,520
have a genomic sequencing that's

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,250
happening and so you can really apply AI

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,349
because it's such a complex problem of

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,020
being able to apply new algorithms to

00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:19,839
find new cures and and root causes to

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,520
two different diseases I mean I think

00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,050
that can be really hugely beneficial to

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,629
the world yeah more than just another

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,800
DNA relative match right it's something

00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,870
that actually is going to affect your

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,039
life absolutely yeah your health yeah

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,500
yeah that's interesting

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,919
well Nicola if we sat down twelve months

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,209
from now and had the same conversation

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,449
what do you think will change in the

00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:40,979
more

00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:45,039
it won't be the most significant hmm I

00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:47,939
mean I think what's gonna change is is

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,650
really that the growth in the number of

00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,360
people that are really applying AI right

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,009
now I think a lot of people are still

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,979
sort of researching it trying to figure

00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:59,110
out how they want to apply it right as

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:01,870
as these use cases are starting to come

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,159
out and as companies really understand

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,229
where it adds a value to the

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:06,939
organization you're gonna start seeing

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,419
it really get adopted pretty widely and

00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,889
pretty quickly

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,509
excellent will we look forward that

00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,719
conversation next year thank you I'll be

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,719
here

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,880
