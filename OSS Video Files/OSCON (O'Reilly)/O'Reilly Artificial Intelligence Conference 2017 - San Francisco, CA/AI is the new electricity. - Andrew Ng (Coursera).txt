Publication date: 2017-09-20
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - San Francisco, CA
Description: 
	Much like the rise of electricity, which started about 100 years ago, AI will revolutionize every major industry. Andrew Ng explains how AI can transform your business, shares major technology trends and thoughts on where your biggest future opportunities may lie, and explores best practices for incorporating AI, machine learning, and deep learning into your organization.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,690
now I'm often asked I think often people

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,770
also ask me hey Andrew what are the

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,320
biggest trends of machine learning

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,929
where's the value creation you know I

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,750
think that today if I look across

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,369
industry the vast majority of economic

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,140
value is created through supervised

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,090
learning and then what are the other

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,250
thing is I would say this is my personal

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,070
opinion and I visit companies and see

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,260
quite a lot of companies AIFS I think

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,760
they transfer learning you know people

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,150
often ask me what's after supervised

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,590
learning

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,059
I think transfer learning is creating

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,770
quite a lot of value today for some

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,840
reason is not that sexy so people don't

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,940
talk about as much this idea that you

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,399
might learn from you know object

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,440
recognition and learn from a huge data

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,360
set image snail and transfer some of

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,039
that knowledge to read x-ray radiology

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,960
images so this is actually creating

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,610
economic value today like this is useful

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,129
I think unsupervised learning is a

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,989
fantastic long-term research project I'm

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,699
super excited about this this is

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,620
creating a little bit of economic value

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,180
especially in word embeddings for

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,159
natural language processing but I always

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,260
say to my personal opinion much less and

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,780
then reinforcement learning is an

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,490
interesting one I worked on

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,430
reinforcement learning for many years do

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,860
a little work on it I think that the the

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,970
excitement and the PR hype on reinforcer

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,100
learning is a bit disproportionate

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,229
relative to the actual economic values

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,130
creating today it turns out reporter

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,560
learning is type of machine learning

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,270
whose hunger for data is even greater

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,799
than supervised learning just this is

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,390
really difficult to get enough data for

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,320
enforcement learning algorithms so it

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,670
turns out they're great for playing

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,290
video games because you're playing a

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,430
video game you can play like an infinite

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,750
number of video games you're in the

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,840
computer by yourself or great for

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,000
playing games basically but outside game

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,189
playing and applications and robotics

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,930
often applications in robotics where you

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,340
can build a simulator and therefore you

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,079
know play it if the number of video

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,880
games driving a car or Bambi you might

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,250
robot walk or whatever I think there's

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,380
still more work to be done to translate

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,210
this to the businesses in practice so

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,670
and I think there is actually rapid fall

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,250
off in the economic value being created

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,110
today going down this list having said

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,520
that this is today and one of the things

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,079
there's a constant in computer science

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,390
is that breakthroughs all the time and

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,190
so the ground under shifts every every

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,819
few years so they could be breakthroughs

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,709
in any of

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,099
which could rapidly reorder this list in

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,099
a few years

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,910
