Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - San Francisco, CA
Description: 
	Jia Li has contributed to some of the most influential datasets in the world and helped transform computer vision from an academic niche into a dominant technology. Jia explains why a democratized approach to AI ensures that the compute, data, algorithms, and talent behind these technologies reach the widest possible audience.

he has been a long and sometimes

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,860
challenging road but we've made

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:13,879
remarkable progress in computer vision

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:17,780
to teach computers to see in the real

00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:20,900
world you might find our work handy when

00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:25,510
your photos are automatically sorted but

00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,510
the real world impact goes beyond that

00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:34,809
see cows and at-risk species due to

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,010
vision and coastal development

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,730
conservationists have been trying their

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:44,510
best to monitor them from the air

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:50,269
usually from playing window but this is

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:52,999
a very costly approach for instance

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:55,730
there is a fecal somewhere in this photo

00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:59,059
but I bet you two have trouble spotting

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:02,569
it and there are tons of thousands of

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,870
images just like this how long it will

00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:08,240
take for us to manually thought through

00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:14,510
through them all and identify all the

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,530
sick houses in it a vision model built

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,650
with tensorflow

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,200
has demonstrated incredible ability in

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,910
identifying the sea cow it's just right

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,060
there and they can easily scale up to

00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:33,080
tens of thousands of images creative

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,660
solutions like this tell us that AI can

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:40,120
make a difference everywhere we just

00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,120
