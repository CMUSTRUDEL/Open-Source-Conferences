so in the Age of AI it really is still

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,109
about the people particularly those who

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,590
can turn AI technology into an

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,440
application value so a few months ago

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,369
LinkedIn released a study where they

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,930
looked at their user base and they

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,210
looked for people who were associating

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,529
AI related technologies and their

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,449
profiles things like deep learning

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,730
computer vision and speech recognition

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,130
and they found a lot of people were

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,570
already starting to do that and a lot of

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,890
them resided in the US if we normalize

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,230
the data for how many people in each

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,750
country uses LinkedIn though we start

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,370
seeing some comparable talent density in

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,200
various countries and not I think it

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,559
just speaks to the international fervor

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,600
about AI and indeed this is because

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,219
there are more and more professional

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,890
opportunities that are emerging for job

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,460
seekers and our own experience with our

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,699
platform Safari where we've noticed that

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,510
there's a surgeon interests around

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:02,510
topics related to AI

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,490
