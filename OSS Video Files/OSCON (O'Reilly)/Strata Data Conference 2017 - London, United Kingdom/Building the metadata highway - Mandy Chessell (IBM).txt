Title: Building the metadata highway - Mandy Chessell (IBM)
Publication date: 2017-05-24
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	The data landscape is broken. So much of an organization’s data is either undiscovered or useless because it has lost the context that gave it meaning. It’s time to rethink the way we manage the data that feeds our analytics and machine learning. Mandy Chessell explores the role that open source, embeddable, and interconnected metadata capability play in transforming the availability and understanding of the dark data that lurks throughout our organizations.

This keynote is sponsored by IBM.
