Title: Building the metadata highway - Mandy Chessell (IBM)
Publication date: 2017-05-24
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	The data landscape is broken. So much of an organization’s data is either undiscovered or useless because it has lost the context that gave it meaning. It’s time to rethink the way we manage the data that feeds our analytics and machine learning. Mandy Chessell explores the role that open source, embeddable, and interconnected metadata capability play in transforming the availability and understanding of the dark data that lurks throughout our organizations.

This keynote is sponsored by IBM.

	00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,839
good morning everybody as thank you for

00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,139
inviting me today I'd like to talk about

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,019
an important project basically our data

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,420
landscape is broken so much of the data

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,420
we try to use for data science has lost

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,430
its original context so it takes ages to

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,480
work out exactly what this data means

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,330
and how useful it is the pink missing

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,630
piece is metadata metadata provides

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,030
information about the original context

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,380
how the data was created what its

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,890
structure is and what it means now if we

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,970
had good metadata across all our data

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,950
landscape we would start to be able to

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,660
build an enterprise catalog so that we

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,970
can find the data that we need not just

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,970
within the enterprise but much more

00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:57,300
broadly when we bring in new tools from

00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:01,590
many vendors these tools can all connect

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:05,580
to it then if that metadata management

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,100
is embedded in the platform the that

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,120
metadata as new data comes available

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:15,480
then it's been it then it's of use

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,460
finally as you start to as you start to

00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,400
build up that welder knowledge inside

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,040
the metadata repository people can

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,230
collaborate around data and you really

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,360
start to get a data-driven organization

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,610
we can start using metadata to drive

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,510
governance enforcement so as the chief

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,340
data office

00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,290
defines the requirements for how

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,330
sensitive data is managed for example

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,940
that can be embedded in the engines that

00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,920
drive the data pipelines so you start to

00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,960
get an environment where there's

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,000
increased trust in the data that's being

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,409
used now what happens today is that

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,290
every vendor believes that their

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,450
metadata repository is came that it's

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,610
the master copy and that you buy their

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,200
product and they bring all the mess that

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,229
you bring all the metadata into that

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,290
product and then their tools work the

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,250
reality is that there are so many cloud

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,700
platforms data platforms

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,700
systems where that data originates that

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,290
it is impossible for a single vendor to

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,960
provide coverage across the data

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,640
landscape so we need to start thinking

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,060
differently about the way metadata is

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,300
managed if you think about 30 years ago

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,950
you used to buy a tcp/ip stack for your

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,370
system in order to connect to the

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,630
internet that doesn't that is now

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,920
embedded into every laptop every system

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,830
similarly with security that used to be

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,020
an add-on now it's embedded so we need

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,040
to start thinking about since metadata

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,560
data is so important to many businesses

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,330
and in fact only any organization's

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,730
operations we need to start thinking

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:59,650
about metadata as being a standard

00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,560
capability within a platform now there

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,150
are many many metadata standards that

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,209
doesn't seem to be solving the problem

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,080
what we really need is an implementation

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,120
that everybody can use so there is an

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,160
area that has actually been incredibly

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,320
successful in common metadata management

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,260
and that is of course digital

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,500
photography you know that you can buy a

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,769
digital camera or your phones take a

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,060
photograph and load it into almost any

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,769
application that's dealing with

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,140
photographs and you can see that

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,810
metadata that metadata is captured by

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,600
your camera and it covers many aspects

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,480
about the light levels that the title

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,660
camera that was used the location of the

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,450
photograph think what that would be like

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,489
if all types of data had this level of

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,549
integration at the platform that would

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:55,420
allow a multi-vendor environment for

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:59,110
metadata so we would effectively have a

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,840
bus so this is saying metadata shouldn't

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,160
be loaded into a single repository

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,280
metadata repositories need to be

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,810
peer-to-peer they need to be able to

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,280
exchange that means we need to download

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,350
formats for metadata that will allow

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,900
different vendors metadata to exchange

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,359
and also for that metadata to be

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,460
embedded into the data platforms such as

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:26,870
a Hadoop platform and it's automatically

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:31,729
that metadata as we go so we need to

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:34,310
rethink the way that we manage metadata

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,410
and governance everything must be

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,030
automated as much as possible because we

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,060
all know we're not very good at filling

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,550
in metadata we need to make it

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,710
ubiquitous because it's all very well

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,449
having the data science platform enabled

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,789
with metadata but all the downstream

00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,979
systems need to be as well plus the

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,569
places that we distribute to if we're

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:56,930
going to sell data we're going to have a

00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,910
data economy we need ways for not just

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,349
the license for the data but also the

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,419
description of that page and how it

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:05,870
should be used in data sides goes with

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:08,419
the data in a standard format and we

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,210
need to be able to access metadata in

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,490
open API as you think about data systems

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,080
and the cloud you can't get in and put

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,300
your own infrastructure underneath there

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,860
to monitor what's going on those systems

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,590
need to be doing the metadata management

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,539
after the box with open API that you can

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,570
connect to and see wait see what's

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:29,449
happening to the data on that platform

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,639
we need to use metadata to govern the

00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:34,460
management of data and that means that

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,460
business people data experts are not

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,800
relying on IT teams to actually code new

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,930
rules around how data is managed because

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,840
the data regulations are moving forward

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,590
fast and we need to end we need to cover

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,719
them and wherever the possible tools

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,229
that work with data should be able to

00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,940
read that data and use it by default so

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:59,120
we start to get an environment where

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:03,770
data is not just zeros and ones data

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,419
always has a context and we and enough

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,729
information to allow it to be used

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:12,500
safely so what does this look like we

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,680
need again to think about these

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,050
repositories as peer-to-peer systems

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,479
they may be in the cloud they may be

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,460
on-premise they need to be gathering

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,219
metadata and managing it as close to the

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,830
source of the data as possible and then

00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,479
making it accessible across it we need

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,240
to think about federated queries across

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,190
these repositories but also replication

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,090
between the repositories wherever

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,960
performances

00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:41,240
issue and we need to support these

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,910
thousands of metadata open standards

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,130
that we have each focused on a tiny part

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,199
of a single type of data but actually

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,080
bring that in together into a coherent

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:58,070
whole than enables data science across a

00:06:51,080 --> 00:07:00,680
variety of data so how can you help how

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,960
are we approaching this so at IBM we

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,180
have a lot of data tools we have data

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,650
platforms and we've realized even within

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,190
our own portfolio that this is

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:13,580
incredibly difficult to manage without

00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:16,280
some sort of open external definition of

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,290
how metadata should be managed most of

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,750
the design decisions we make around a

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,930
metadata repository actually are not

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,389
valuable innovation we need to do is to

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,580
say no stop let's not innovate at a

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,430
metadata repository level let's make

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,220
that an open-source platform that we can

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,800
all use so we've chosen Apache Atlas as

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,240
this as this metadata base and we want

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,919
to turn it from a Hadoop based gatherer

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,070
of metadata to an open metadata platform

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,250
with a full range of data standards from

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,240
basic greater understanding glossaries

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,720
collaboration information governance

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,880
information lineage as well as discovery

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,360
analytics allowing us to create that

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,599
rich enterprise catalog that it's

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,550
interconnected now with open source open

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,229
source gives us a community where we can

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,470
discuss what these structures should be

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:14,690
and collectively contribute to the

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,370
implementation having an open

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,530
implementation lowers the barrier of

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,660
entry for metadata management and this

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,660
will allow many more vendors to be able

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:26,419
to to be able to have metadata built

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,760
into their platform and also to for

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:31,099
other vendors to say it is worth me

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,990
building my tools on this open standard

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,659
because there is such an ecosystem

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,089
sitting behind it so this is something

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,950
where we want to change the industry we

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,469
want to change the way that data is

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,420
managed in IT systems to make that data

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:50,430
more valuable than it currently is

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:53,190
so given its an open open community this

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,210
is Apache Atlas community there is a

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,430
wiki in on that wiki we have put

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,710
information about the work that we're

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,680
doing the different projects the drivers

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,230
that are opened and please you're very

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,840
welcome to join us to enter into the

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:14,180
discussion to help us get these formats

00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:17,070
as wide and as useful as possible and

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,260
and give us and give us the best

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,940
metadata platform that will enable our

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:27,719
