hi this is Mike Hendrickson strata data

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,240
in London I'm here with SIA from Intel

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,160
yeah how you doing very good great to

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,950
see you again Mike you too last we spoke

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,410
was in Singapore in December so you gave

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,849
a keynote today can you unpack a little

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,859
bit about what are the main points you

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:21,270
wanted today for people to take away

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:25,560
yeah sure so um you know earlier this

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:28,260
year our CEO BK Brian krzanich has

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,080
informed an industry that Intel has

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,210
transformed into a data company so we

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,130
have been going along the data journey

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,350
for several years now and now that and

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,579
that's why you know in Singapore a lot

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,770
of time we talked about our data

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,230
strategy so one of the largest Silicon

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,530
makers and hardware is now a data

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,570
company if the data company so this is

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,170
because the growth in our data center

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,640
and other businesses is driven by our

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,660
industry's data transformation you know

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,930
in the previous years we worked on the

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,019
technologies for enabling big data and

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,450
analytics workloads for customers and

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,930
now we're working on the AI workloads

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,780
for customers but whether it's you know

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,540
AI its Big Data or analytics our

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,000
commitment is always the same we will

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,310
make sure that we deliver the best

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,250
experience for our customers workloads

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,900
on Intel hardware so now when you say

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,270
Intel hardware you mean you you guys

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,270
cover everything from way down at the

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,240
chip level all the way through the stack

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,229
is that how Intel looks at data now yes

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:41,790
yes so at the the silicon level we have

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,740
been driving innovations and you saw all

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,470
the innovation that we're doing with a

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,740
computer storage shed and a network and

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,290
even at the computer space you saw the

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,630
work that we do is they on the FI FPGA

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,619
and anumana and then at the software

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,590
level we optimize data and analytics and

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,439
AI workloads on Intel hardware for must

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,490
improve the performance of scalability

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,369
and ease of use

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,590
and the security at the end of them you

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,300
know using analytics as the example we

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,950
have been driving

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,170
analytics deployment on Intel platform

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,080
and so a lot of your partners that plug

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,730
into the Intel platform the ecosystem

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,300
are seeing big gains because of

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,250
performance and scalability and security

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,700
is that what Intel's bringing to kind of

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:35,050
that partner ecosystem right and that's

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,090
what we mean by best experience for our

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:41,570
customers and for our ecosystem is for

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,900
best performance for cost effectiveness

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:47,750
and for ease of use and for security and

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,660
scalability and you know Intel has

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,470
proven to be a leader and we are

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,110
uniquely positioned for democratizing

00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,500
technologies whether it's for AI for

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,980
analytics or for a big data previously

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,260
so how important is ok since Intel is

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,870
now a data company or is a data company

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,990
how important is AI to your future as

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:15,080
well is that is that is data and AI now

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,610
synonymous or are they two still two

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,220
separate things but really important

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,250
together you know they are part of the

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,290
one journey in if I look at our data

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,620
journey many years ago one in first

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,630
started we're talking about having you

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,120
know most cost-effective data storage

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,940
solutions which is that's why we you

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,300
know started optimizing Hadoop solution

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,100
stack on Intel hardware and then later

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,350
on we were looking for a more performant

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,450
data processing engine that's why we

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,209
started working on spark for Intel

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,450
hardware and then after that we started

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:53,300
introducing analytics experience on

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,340
Intel hardware and with a traditional

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,980
machine learning getting added to the

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,090
analytics layer and then in recent

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,250
couple of years AI is becoming the next

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,410
wave of this journey so we're just

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,810
continuing with our data journey and

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,200
this is exactly why the case that we

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,720
have transformed into a data company

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,970
because the journey does not start this

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,640
year you know it's a continuous

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:23,060
evolution for our technologies and at

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,530
the end of the day we want to work with

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,500
the ecosystem and make sure our

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,350
customers and

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,080
owners they have the best experience and

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,300
then again performance scalability cause

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,210
effectiveness and a security on our

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,630
hardware but I'm also leveraging our

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,970
software capabilities so Intel has

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,730
always been notorious for like improving

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,830
performance and like Moore's law with

00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,930
with processor speeds and everything

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,000
just kept growing and crazy our is the

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,790
same thing going to happen now in the

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,310
data and AI world where you're going to

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,640
build it in jest and make make decisions

00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,790
quickly from AI and machine learning

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,730
combinations

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,669
I think performance is one and obviously

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,680
you know as a technology company you you

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,169
know it's very easy to say you know my

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,050
performance is better but I think at the

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,330
end of the day the dobson the impact of

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,540
your technology is going to be measured

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,480
by how much you're satisfying the

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,570
customers needs and again after years of

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,450
working with our customers in data in

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,760
analytics and AI space it is clear

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,979
nowadays customers are no longer just

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,690
looking for performance they're looking

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,030
for security they're looking for

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,160
scalability they're looking for ease of

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,220
use they're looking for lower cost of

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,770
ownership so then how do we make sure

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,740
that we provide the software and

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,810
hardware solution stack that really will

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,890
address those needs rather than just the

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,419
performance itself

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,220
so you look at the holistic picture of

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,080
working with your customer including

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,090
probably reliability in there as well

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,180
right yeah one of those things where if

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,590
you have a medical medical device or

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,050
whatever that's feeding data were

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,450
learning from a patient you can't have

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,750
that fail or anything like that so until

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:13,800
I look at is great hardware and in the

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:18,300
past data company now if we fast forward

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,460
10 years are you an AI company or are

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,770
you what what do you see it looks to say

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,590
not 10 years because that's way too far

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,960
out there with the way the industry

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,310
changes so quickly 3 years from now what

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,890
do you think Intel's going to look like

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:36,690
I think we will continue with our data

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:39,190
journey but our goal or our strategy is

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,010
always the same no matter what the

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,920
next a wave is we will make sure that we

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,100
give customers the best experience using

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,050
our hardware and a software solution so

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,870
maybe today is performance of

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,000
scalability and security for some or

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,630
clothes and then we're also looking at

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,150
cost-effectiveness and you know other

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,460
customer needs but we really at the end

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:06,070
satisfying and address customer's needs

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,650
is our biggest goal for different new

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,000
workloads that's that's yet to come

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,860
excellency we look forward to that

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,760
journey with you thank you so much thank

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,760
you Thanks

00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,980
