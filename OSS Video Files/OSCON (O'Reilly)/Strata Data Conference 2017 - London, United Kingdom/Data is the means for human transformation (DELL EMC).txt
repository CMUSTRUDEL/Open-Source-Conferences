hi this is Mike Anderson from strata

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,629
data in London I'm here with Cory and

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,020
Ross how you gentleman doing good thank

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,330
you Mike

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,490
so you're with sell um see and that's a

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,250
large company with a lot of different

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,379
entities can you tease apart what you

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,699
guys are all about and what your what

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,640
your different players are yeah

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,050
absolutely so as you say den AMC is part

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,180
of the larger Dell technologies

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,939
organization now and that's brought

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,429
together a number of companies in the IT

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,880
industry under the one umbrella from a

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,460
VMware perspective through SecureWorks

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,800
RSA virtustream Bhoomi

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,250
and now Dell EMC coming together as well

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,250
a really powerful powerhouse inside the

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,379
the IT organized a IT sector driving IT

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,480
digital security and workforce

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,239
transformation and Dell EMC makes up an

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,680
important part of that from a

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,230
traditional data center infrastructure

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,780
perspective having a portfolio of

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,359
products through servers storage and now

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,039
switches as well so a big consolidation

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,470
from a Dell technologies perspective and

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,760
so what do you gentlemen do with Dell I

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,799
mean because it is a large organization

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,630
and there's probably a lot of different

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,909
roles though what do you have guys

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,090
actually work on yeah so I work on an

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,560
lead a team of highly talented pre-sales

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,810
systems engineers as we call them

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,479
focused on unstructured data and big

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,240
data and analytics in the ania

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,250
marketplace okay and I'm a principal

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,990
systems engineer but I also lead the

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,299
global go to market for our Big Data

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,650
solutions team so we bring together a

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,329
number of products from across our

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,530
portfolio put them together and

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,630
well-engineered

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,920
highly validated ways and bring them to

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,170
market for customers so that it's easy

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
to adopt our technologies for the good

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,189
of workloads he said systems engineer my

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,189
background is I'm an I'm an engineer by

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,799
trade that's an issue inc so when I look

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,320
at Dell I think of like hardware and all

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,149
the way up to the cloud and you have a

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,700
data solution that takes you from the

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,409
base all the way through yeah so we

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,299
think about it and you can think about

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,530
it in terms of the stack but one of the

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,049
ways we like to think about it is the

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,340
buy versus build continuum so at the

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,630
lowest end of the stack if you want to

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,429
build something out of components

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,979
meaning you want to buy Best of Breed

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,080
components from compute now

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,790
storage software if you want to

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,170
integrate those components yourself we

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,780
have the industry's broadest portfolio

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,400
as it relates to buying components to

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,500
build a stack to support a workload in

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,870
an application but if you're looking to

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,069
buy an outcome rather than build it

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,569
yourself if you'd like to buy the

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,879
outcome of what's a big data as a

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:32,390
service and we certainly provide the

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,489
capability to do exactly that and so the

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,370
kinds of partners you work with our a

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:40,459
traditional Enterprise IT companies or

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,079
is it across the board from your pivotal

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,150
group working with startups and

00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:47,569
different companies all the way through

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,250
that IT sector I think it's for me

00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,290
absolutely everywhere there's another

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,000
single answer to that question it's

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,620
great being at strata here in London

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,810
this week because everybody on the show

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,060
floor is is a partner in some shape or

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,980
form either inside a customer or were

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,079
actively working with from a go-to

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,180
market perspective you know we we

00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,040
partner with the biggest organizations

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,569
in the world you touched on on pivotal

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,420
and they're partnerships with some of

00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,489
the leading industry brands in their

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,319
fields but we also partner with you know

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,880
the small upcoming organizations

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,760
especially around things like data

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,950
analytics AI Internet of Things those

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,049
types of things and so what excites you

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,819
about data working at Dalian see what

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,769
what is the most exciting thing that you

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,510
guys bring to that that world

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,389
yeah I think the the thing that excites

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,919
me is the fact that data is one of them

00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,239
means for transformation and we're

00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,980
really having an impact on human

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,169
progress so we're helping organisations

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,329
solve really interesting challenges by

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,790
bringing what L sensibly many times is

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,709
unique very very well differentiated

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,450
hardware offerings to market that make

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,400
it easier for organisations adopting

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,530
some of these data platforms to do it

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,629
better to do it faster we actually just

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,730
received the John McCain award for

00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:57,109
leadership from t Jem which is a great

00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,280
customer of ours where we actually help

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,739
them accelerate their high performance

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,450
computing and data analytics so that

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,370
they could fight childhood cancer faster

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,780
and so it's those kinds of human

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,730
progress stories that we see that

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,919
organizations are using Dell EMC

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,590
technologies to accomplish really big

00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,120
worldwide good for Humanity kind of

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,290
things and that's the stuff that you

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,729
know makes it worth getting into the

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,620
weeds and have an appeal is about the

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,599
you know the hard architecture

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,400
conversations and the exciting you know

00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,790
evolutions we see in technology that

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,260
makes

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,480
worth it when you can connect it back to

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,580
really human progress and so that

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,080
evolution is important and a lot of

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,730
people call what they're doing is

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,320
digital transformation and really

00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,820
they're on continual transformation

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,060
because there isn't a stopping point

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,040
anymore turning so in that journey where

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,390
where would you say a company that has

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,160
something that they want to solve in the

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,900
world like Tim O'Reilly had a came out

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,820
this morning talked about some big hairy

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,980
problems in the world we're just going

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,790
to start with you guys where do they get

00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:55,190
their their beginning like we have we'd

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,020
like to solve food distribution in

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,330
Africa or something yeah where would

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,460
they start so that's so I think it's you

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,720
have to tenner every kind of project and

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,630
the way you approaching these things

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,370
with what is the desired outcome and

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,320
having big picture ideas is certainly a

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,230
wonderful thing but what a Berk goes

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,030
into attainable digestible achievable

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,040
bites right so one of the things that we

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,720
do as an organization is really focus on

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,330
the consultative side of helping

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,740
organisations identify those problems

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,000
are those challenges that can have the

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,130
biggest impact on their business the

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,810
fastest so through our global consulting

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,880
organization we've actually built a

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,200
number of service offerings that are

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,970
really around helping organisations

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,280
understand what does it mean to be

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,370
data-driven identify projects that are

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,320
of high value but maybe also very very

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,990
feasible in terms of deployment and then

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,600
help them evolve and achieve early wins

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,240
so they can have those digestible wins

00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,740
an early start wins because we see some

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,540
of these projects if you start with too

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,250
big of a picture in mind that you don't

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,320
have a specific measurable objective

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,630
then you can often fail and we know this

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,040
is a capitalistic world that we need to

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,020
make some money or save some money we

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,970
need to feed the CEO or CFO s needs and

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,100
if we don't do those it's really hard to

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,360
get funding for future projects so we

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,670
advise customers to take a really

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,110
pragmatic approach engage smart

00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,120
consultants and good partners who can

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,540
help you achieve those objectives faster

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,700
start small achieve big so it's not a

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,320
small achieve big you touched on digital

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,240
transformation and I think a lot of that

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,700
starts with true IT transformation as

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,680
well you know starting ensuring that the

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,510
IT and the business are aligned the

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,070
common goals and striving towards

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,680
solving those business outcome problems

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,120
and as Corey said organizations across

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,850
the spectrum are becoming more and more

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,460
data-driven

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,960
and really deriving value out of the

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,430
data that they either already have

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,490
inside of their organization or

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,040
constantly capturing in new forms and

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,740
new ways and that's across many

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,060
different industry sectors from

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,620
automotive through autonomy or

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,930
development of autonomous cars and as

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,360
toward Cori touched on in healthcare as

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,090
well as huge area for us where you know

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,700
human progress and the need for genome

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,470
sequencing and advanced healthcare you

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,200
know it starts with a business outcome

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,940
it starts with a human outcome but it

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,010
needs IT to be aligned to that as well

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,140
so from a systems engineering

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,440
perspective do you see different

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:17,650
different industries that are moving

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,200
faster towards a full-on data solution

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,750
ai solution and do you see other parts

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,700
of the world or parts of the world when

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,830
I say other depends on where you're

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,840
sitting we're in London now so yeah do

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:32,050
you see parts of the world adopting AI

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,880
and data as a solution quicker than

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,470
others you know I don't know if I'd say

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,000
there's any one part of the world where

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,650
it happens I think it's probably you're

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,600
going to see densities where you have

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,040
talent densities because any of these

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,080
transformations they're powered by three

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,000
key things people process and technology

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,040
right so we've we've seen the

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,870
technologies globally globally available

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,220
we have great supply chains that can get

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,960
to write tech to the right people at the

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,510
right time but it's the people in

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,090
process that gets challenging so we see

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,370
talent hubs being the the reals you know

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,380
the real driver for activity so you know

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,880
anime you know here in Europe there's a

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,440
number of obviously London being a big

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,330
one we also see a number of areas that

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,070
are fostering startups that also have

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,050
really strong university cultures that

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,760
are investing in the skills that it

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,430
takes to achieve digital transformation

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,470
take advanced mathematics statistics the

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,600
the newest kind of type of program we're

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,460
going to Scala Python are right where

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,050
we're investing in new skills there

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,540
that's where we start to see and that's

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,100
true across each of the theaters but I

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,110
wouldn't say that there's one far ahead

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,610
of the others I do say I do always get

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,460
some funny emails from our buddies in

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,750
Australia that they have some

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,430
interesting projects going on there some

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,680
of their telcos are doing some some very

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,190
interesting stuff that it's pretty

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,020
innovative

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,430
maybe it's positioned their weekends on

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,460
the beach and have happy times do you

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,649
see industry so there may be out front a

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,050
little bit is it medical is it

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,360
retail anything like that or they're all

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,730
like are we on the same journey together

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,769
that's I think it's across the board

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,329
I think there's big advancements across

00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,309
the board in a number of different

00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,230
industries I think there's some that you

00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,939
can dive down into a little bit more and

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,009
see some some quicker progress around

00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:07,869
digital adoption and digital startups

00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:09,970
you know really disrupting the

00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:11,920
marketplace but I think generally it's

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,619
across the board and as Corey says often

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,929
its global collaboration amongst those

00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:18,790
those major hubs around the world which

00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:20,410
is driving that progress and driving the

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,779
adoption yeah I think depended upon the

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,179
industry you see different parts of the

00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:27,129
big data economy come into play so you

00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:29,319
know manufacturing we typically think of

00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:31,269
manufacturing is maybe a more stodgy

00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,499
slower industry in general but I think

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,910
that they've done some incredible work

00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:35,139
we're seeing some large global

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,879
manufacturers do some of the most

00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,990
interesting things around connected

00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,879
devices and predictive maintenance

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,410
outcomes right where they're improving

00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,749
the efficiency of their production

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,189
processes by using data and the millions

00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,869
of connected devices that they have in

00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:48,519
their plants and then if you see things

00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:50,410
like financial services we expect them

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,389
to be out ahead and that's ok because

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,920
they're they have to do things like

00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,540
fight fraud which is a great data

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,309
analytics play but then you see the

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,079
automotive manufacturers that are as a

00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:00,639
subset of manufacturing doing

00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,889
interesting things are on autonomous

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,290
cars that's driving a you know machine

00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:06,850
learning and AI I think - it's really -

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,259
it's achievable limits today so that's

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,139
where some of the most interesting I

00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,910
guess innovation I'm seeing happen but

00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:14,740
again it depends on the industry but in

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,839
each industry they have specific plays

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,819
that are getting pretty popular so if we

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,209
look back 10 years ago when we started

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:24,399
the Strada ado draw the data big data

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,009
was like a terabyte and that was big

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,529
yeah if we look forward three years what

00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:33,009
is big gonna mean in the data world I

00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:36,249
mean is big humongous is it going to be

00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:39,879
NASA scale data where we're looking at

00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:42,459
planets and galaxies that amount of data

00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,959
what is big going to be in the future I

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,790
think that's pretty a couple of ounces

00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,069
about how are you guys so you handled

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,889
your up so high / yeah I think it comes

00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:53,410
down to you know scalability and

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:56,410
interpretation of big data in a big data

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,550
- evolving into things like real time

00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,260
analytics and

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,450
you know analytics at the edge and not

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,260
just kind of in the core is an evolution

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,899
of Big Data

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,970
scalability really the streaming all of

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,440
those things real-time analytics taking

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,180
what Cory just said from a manufacturing

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,110
perspective you know Internet of Things

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:17,320
and and making that analysis real-time

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,180
and data-driven insights but the edge is

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,100
one way of looking at it and I think

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,740
there's also a scale in terms of

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,170
capacity as well know ooh BRR on the

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,860
mainstage yesterday fantastic example of

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,000
how digital disruptor in the

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,490
transportation industry is now

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,649
generating huge amounts of data through

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,320
their use of technology and autonomous

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,200
cars that have entered 250 gigabytes an

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,940
hour per car a huge amount of things and

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,500
you can scale that out over the future

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,720
and that's just one organization who's

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,230
doing it yeah it actually picked the so

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,510
the the size and scale I think we're

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,790
terabytes were the the norm then I think

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,890
petabytes are very much the norm now I

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,450
think exabytes are where we're going

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,339
right so we're learning our Greek and

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,649
then I actually have had conversations

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,720
over the last year with some very large

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,730
global manufacturing and global orders

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,680
that are talking Yoda byte sort of scale

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,870
which is not even something that we have

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,120
hid out right so there's a there's

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,839
there's certainly scale concerns do it

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,160
on Star Wars

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,070
that's one of your things all right

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,020
maybe that's why the galaxy yeah so so

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,880
there's certainly scale concerns and

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,130
there's physics that come into play

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,720
right so we're starting to see that you

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,430
know in the in the solid-state disk

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,770
market where certain seed densities get

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,050
really really high right now higher than

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,790
spinning drives does that mean they'll

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,079
replace them I don't know it depends on

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,930
the availability of certain resources

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,970
natural resources but I think the scale

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,459
is is one part of it in terms of the

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,350
capacity part but I think another piece

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,870
of it is the scale at which we have the

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,540
number of devices creating data and how

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,220
we get smarter at consuming or using

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,570
that data at the edge without having to

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,920
send it across the network we're getting

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,570
smart about what we do because we

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,160
frankly don't have enough bandwidth

00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,050
currently to send all the data being

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,760
created at the edge back to a court

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,680
anyway so we're going to have to see

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,320
evolutions in a number of parts of the

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,810
IT sector both in storage technology and

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,180
computational technology in network

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,960
technology but also in likely analytics

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,570
programs that can

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,290
on very small devices at the edge so

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:19,390
last question speaking for Dell EMC how

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,030
do you see humans in that future in the

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:25,030
loop so data is going to be massively

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,970
important but it's not the whole thing

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,490
so how is Belle going to you know

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,550
balance the the humans that are needed

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:37,510
to interpret the data or to serve the

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,440
data or to you know manipulate or make

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,110
decisions with it

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,000
how does Dell look at that in the future

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,020
yeah so I think that the people part of

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,450
it is young we said it's part of that

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,100
tripod people process and technology we

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,720
continue to foster development with

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,670
universities around the world because

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,860
it's as a human evolution if you look at

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,720
each of the industrial revolutions now

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,700
the digital revolution something

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,100
happened and that is the many of the

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,940
basic you know unskilled or low-skilled

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:06,910
jobs do get surmounted by technology in

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,250
many ways which forces us as a people to

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,630
become more skilled and more relevant in

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,280
new ways so I think that we're going to

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,750
see that new skills are going to come

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,220
interesting I have a have a

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,440
four-year-old and a two-year-old that

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,820
I'm excited to see what technology will

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,500
be available next two to three years

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,330
that want to teach them how to code

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,800
teach them out of develop these these

00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,690
skills that are going to be necessary in

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,190
a new economy but I think it's I think

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,470
it's a matter of it's a real opportunity

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,810
for us to use these technologies for

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,880
again human progress to solve some of

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,860
the biggest hairiest challenges we have

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,480
on our plate and I think that if we as a

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,220
people start to take that very seriously

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,200
and educate ourselves and get focused on

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,150
it I think we can be able be successful

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,880
excellent I think there's an element for

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,370
me around creativity and productivity as

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,230
well huge advances advances in

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,630
technology are driving productivity

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,400
amongst the workforce and transformation

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,500
around the workforce and how people work

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,180
and operate on a day to day basis but I

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,020
also think there's a huge opportunity

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:05,110
for things like AI and augmented reality

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,600
to help drive creativity as well to next

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,040
levels freeing up people as Corey talked

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,050
about you know industrial revolutions

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,880
throughout the course of history have

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,910
allowed people to become more creative

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,320
and foster innovation faster because of

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,390
the technology that they're developing

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,880
and I'm excited about that I have a

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,310
young family as well like orient and I

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,410
often talk to them about

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,610
picking up devices and using them

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,920
because that's their future that's how

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:32,140
they're going to work and learn and play

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,820
going forward so their creativity and

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,040
productivity I think is huge advances

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,450
around around IT transformation

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,800
excellence although we look forward to

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,720
that journey to the future with you

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,720
folks thank you might like your best mic
