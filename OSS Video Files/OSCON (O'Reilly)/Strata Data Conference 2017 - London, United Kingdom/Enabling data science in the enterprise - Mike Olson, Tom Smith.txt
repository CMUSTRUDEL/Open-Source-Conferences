Title: Enabling data science in the enterprise - Mike Olson, Tom Smith
Publication date: 2017-05-25
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Mike Olson (Cloudera), Tom Smith (Office of National Statistics)

Data science and machine learning are powering some of the most ambitious business solutions of the time. In today’s world, a vibrant ecosystem of open data science tools is coupled with big data solutions to address a wide range of data science analyses at immense scale. Mike Olson and Tom Smith explain how the Office of National Statistics (ONS), the UK’s largest independent producer of official statistics, is leveraging data science to create repeatable, accurate, and transferable statistical research while decreasing time in developing models with better visibility and results.

	00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,500
so I want to share with you just a

00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,330
couple of the examples of work we're

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
doing and really kind of give you a

00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,629
sense of what we're up to so earlier

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,670
this year

00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:15,340
ons launched the data science campus

00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,020
which I need we're currently team of 26

00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,240
data scientists we're doubling in size

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,390
again this year we're shortly going out

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,589
to recruit so a small pitch if any of

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,960
you are interested in using your data

00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:27,579
science skills for public goods then do

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,400
look out for the recruitment and so on

00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,659
but give you a sense of some of the some

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,600
of the work and projects that were

00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:36,879
underway we work on experiments so we're

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,710
exploring the value of data and that to

00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,440
me is really the key part of data

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,420
science and we start the experiment with

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,039
a question and the question for this

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,640
piece an early question we asked was

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,920
what value is there in image data and

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,899
street level imagery particularly to

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,480
understand and produce indicators that

00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,969
tell us something about the UK at local

00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,469
level on an issue we're interested in so

00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,350
we're working in this instance with the

00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:03,910
natural capital team in an OH&S trying

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,490
to understand the value of the local

00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,160
environment and our work is producing a

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:12,070
data set that cat will accept the level

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,080
of greenery of foliage of trees and so

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,050
on at local level but interestingly

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,790
based on Street View imagery so lots of

00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,370
organizations and obviously famously

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,650
Google a collecting street-level imagery

00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,870
what we're doing is sampling this data

00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,610
around the country running it through

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,950
neural network classifiers and

00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,440
essentially using that to turn from

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,600
images across to the map on the right

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,700
which essentially gives you an estimate

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,140
an indicator of the greenery in the

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,000
local area this is something we didn't

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,040
have a measure of before so it really

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
hits our kind of buttons around the

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,820
value of new types of data that perhaps

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,520
we haven't used the types of analysis

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,980
that you need to run and assess those

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,510
sorts of datasets and producing

00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,060
something in the real world that is of

00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:59,140
value to OH&S and all of the our users

00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,450
the second example I want to share with

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,280
you is a project that we're working on

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,920
in collaboration with with the duck

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,900
statistics agencies or OH&S along with

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,060
other agencies in the world spotted the

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,799
kind of global statistical system we

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,049
work together and collaborate on how to

00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,530
understand the economy out to understand

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,530
the size

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,840
and population in ways that can support

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,510
decisions and what the question we asked

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,330
ourselves here was what data do we have

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:29,410
that can give us a faster readout on the

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,570
economy so official statistics GDP tend

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,190
to cover a quarter of the year and come

00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,080
out about a month after the end of the

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,900
quarter an OH&S is pretty well in terms

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,630
of speed but for example looking at Road

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,760
sensors so 60,000 Road sensors across

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,400
the Netherlands looking on minute by

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,130
minute car but track traffic and volume

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,290
of vehicles can use to give you a live

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,270
real-time estimate of the strength of

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,640
the economy now it's messy as hell it's

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,110
real data but essentially this is giving

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,000
you a window onto something that we

00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,410
didn't necessarily have before so that

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,630
again kind of is a really interesting

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,220
use of new types of data and perhaps

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,830
different ways of understanding the

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,630
world and measuring the world the third

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,970
and final example I wanted to share with

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,400
you which probably takes a bit of a

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,470
broader remit so this is working with

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,840
the UN sustainable development goals

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,540
teams and this is an international

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,900
effort to look at goals across countries

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,290
and ways of measuring those those goals

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,670
and Tart indicators to ensure that the

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,340
day for you on benefits so this is

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,760
around using data for public good across

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,760
