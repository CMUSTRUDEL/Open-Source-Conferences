	00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:06,329
so let's now get a little bit more

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,670
specific so I'm sure many of you here in

00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:11,040
the audience have received that really

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,230
annoying phone call from your bank or a

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,850
credit card company telling you that

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,189
your current account has been blocked

00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,589
frozen due to what looked like a

00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:21,179
suspicious transaction and they ask you

00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,880
to confirm whether it was a legitimate

00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,009
transaction so that is fraud detection

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,659
and guess what

00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:33,900
AI is pretty good at it in fact during a

00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:38,760
project that I worked on we managed to

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:42,120
deploy AI that replace a human expert

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,310
rule based system to well achieve

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,160
amazing things so for starters it

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,780
achieves a ten times 10x efficiency

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,270
improvement in the form of hot cutting

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,510
of the operation but also it ensure that

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,930
you get you've got a few of those phone

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,910
calls

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,670
fewer legitimate transactions were

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,390
blocked and then also it managed to

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,659
detect an extra 10% of genuine fraud so

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,120
that is pretty cool but you know what it

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,030
doesn't really change the world the way

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,550
that driverless car does but I think

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,370
where things get a little bit more

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:20,250
interesting and impactful is it turns

00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,890
out that fraud detection belongs to a

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,560
general class of problems called anomaly

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:30,390
detection which have a much wider impact

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:35,310
in finance so we're all here in London

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,340
we're just not so long ago there was a

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,280
bank called Barings Bank where the Queen

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,950
used to Bank and it was more than 200

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,690
years old and it no longer exists now

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,580
because of the financial crisis but

00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:52,010
because of one guy called Nick Leeson

00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:55,770
who was a rogue trader and he managed to

00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,270
drive this very old venerable

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,760
institution to bankruptcy

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,580
single-handedly so if you can use

00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,799
anomaly detection to revolt to detect

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,950
this kind of activity as well as things

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,420
like insider trading which is illegal

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,300
market abuse as well as kind of

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,550
violations of the workplace code of

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,740
conduct then you have a lot

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,870
more impact that is of societal

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,500
relevance not to mention last at least

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,500
