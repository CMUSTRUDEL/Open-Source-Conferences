Title: Using AI to create new jobs - Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media, Inc.)
Publication date: 2017-05-25
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	The history of technology shows that while new technology has always destroyed jobs, it has also created new ones, in part because it makes things that were previously too expensive cheap enough to expand demand. AI will make currently unthinkable things possible. If we put it to work properly, it can lead to prosperity; if we put it to work destroying jobs, that is our failure of imagination. Tim Oâ€™Reilly delves into the history of some past technological transitions, speculates on the future possibilities of this one, and shares some thoughts about what is keeping us from making the right choices to govern our creations.

	00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:10,930
good morning two weeks ago I I spoke to

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:14,740
a device in my kitchen and I said it's

00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:17,170
my flight on time and when it confirmed

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,920
that it was I asked it to call me a car

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,360
and a few minutes later a lift showed up

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,260
to take me to the airport

00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,619
uh anyone watching this just even a few

00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,230
years ago would have said no he just

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:35,140
what's going on there all right

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:38,590
WTF of course is an expression of wonder

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,260
and delight in that case but a lot of

00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,540
people are hearing the news about

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,980
technology today and particularly

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,070
technologies like artificial

00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,770
intelligence and they're saying WTF in a

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,170
very different tone of voice because

00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,110
they're hearing about this study from

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,579
Oxford University that 47% of jobs are

00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,160
at risk of being automated in the next

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,870
20 years they're hearing that

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,360
self-driving trucks are going to put

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,900
millions of trucks and lorry drivers out

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,860
of work they're even hearing increasing

00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,540
calls for universal basic income because

00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,600
it's just not going to be enough work

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,369
for humans to do now

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,970
I actually think universal basic income

00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:25,420
may be a very good idea but as TS Eliot

00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,000
once said this last temptation is the

00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,549
greatest reason to do the right deed for

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,150
the wrong reason it's for murder in the

00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:37,000
cathedral the idea that there is nothing

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:41,920
left for humans to do strikes me as

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,140
deeply offensive our global economy has

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,540
the mistaken idea that the goal of

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,000
technology is to maximize efficiency and

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,100
profits even if that means treating

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,920
people as a cost to be eliminated that's

00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,710
the rotten idea at the core of our use

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
of technology in this economy

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:03,369
I've been increasingly coming to believe

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,270
that our economy is in the thrall of

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:10,479
what you might think of as a rogue AI

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,430
that is as our world becomes more and

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,439
more controlled by algorithms

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,890
we have to ask what is the fitness

00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,260
function of the algorithm that drives

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,480
behavior so you think about google

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,790
search for example the fitness function

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,680
is relevant they're sitting there and

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,439
they have all these factors and all

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,599
these programs and algorithms and big

00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,700
data and they're driving towards giving

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,599
you the result that they think will be

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,450
the answer to what you're seeking

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,250
Facebook has similar rich data

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,500
infrastructure and they're trying to

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,819
figure out what content you will most

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,209
respond to now what we've seen in the

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,799
case of both Google and Facebook is that

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:59,579
bad actors try to manipulate the

00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:03,040
algorithms you also see that maybe the

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:05,920
creators didn't get it quite right well

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,310
our economy is also in the thrall of a

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,819
set of algorithms and we have told these

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:16,329
algorithms what to do we have told them

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:18,459
to optimize for corporate efficiency and

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,949
corporate profit and particularly for

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,190
stock price even if that means getting

00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:27,160
rid of people and I think it's time for

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,280
us to retune those algorithms to change

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,440
the way that we direct the economy what

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,549
is the fitness function that we want to

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,859
direct these magical powers that we are

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,010
putting in place so that we experience

00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:45,389
more of the WTF of delight and less of

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,389
