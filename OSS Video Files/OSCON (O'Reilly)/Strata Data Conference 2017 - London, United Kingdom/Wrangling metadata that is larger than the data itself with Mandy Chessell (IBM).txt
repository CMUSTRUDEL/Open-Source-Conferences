hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,339
data in London I'm here with Mandy from

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,589
IBM Mandy how are you doing I'm very

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,929
well thank you so you gave a keynote

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,120
this morning and a very provocative

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,460
start saying the data landscape is

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,850
broken can you unpack that a little bit

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,720
yeah sure so I mean obviously we have

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,480
thousands of different types of systems

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,670
and that's where the data is born it's

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,340
also born in mobile applications in

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,170
devices and sensors and then it comes

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,849
down the wire as bits and bytes and then

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,859
the data scientist who sees that thinks

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,559
well what's that about what does it mean

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,960
what's its quality how much can I rely

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,260
on it where can I use it all these

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,420
questions are known to the original

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,750
system owners where the data came from

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,920
but not known to anybody downstream so

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,010
if you really want to get value out the

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,750
data we have to start labeling it making

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,059
sure all that tribal knowledge around

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,370
it's the data origin moves with the data

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,770
and so when the data scientist gets the

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,629
data there's enough information to that

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,439
we can use it effectively so how much

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,869
context can you pack into that metadata

00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,490
description of the data I true the

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,070
metadata can get bigger than the data in

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,320
many respects because you want you need

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,500
to understand it's for massive structure

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,590
as much information about the thought

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,180
process behind nature as it captured so

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,430
you know for example if you're

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,460
collecting names of people who are

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,650
prospects for selling for marketing

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,729
that's a very different data collection

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,579
process that when you're actually

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,259
signing up customers for an account that

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,509
has financial responsibilities

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,040
associated with it so the both customer

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,409
lists for the two very very different

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,270
types of customer lists so it's that

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,220
type of information that's almost as

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,820
valuable as knowing this one's written

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,280
in XML

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,579
this one's written in innocent sort of

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,860
binary format and so like in the case of

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,170
I know one of your former scientists

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,869
Jeff Jonas used to say data finds data

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,049
okay how would you do metadata for data

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:06,450
that's finding data yeah exploratory

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:09,000
zooming so it's almost like it's them as

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,560
a cyclist say as there's small games you

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,360
do you do this if you get small gain and

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,210
that's really how much the data works is

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,980
you you

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,930
you put what you know at the start and

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,520
then they should process more you get

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,620
deeper understanding in the structure of

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,750
the data and it's and how it's changing

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,040
over time and then you can start

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,750
bringing in other data and say well

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,310
actually these columns in this table

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,500
with exactly the same as the columns in

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,420
this table is probably the same data and

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,850
then you start to say okay this is a

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,790
broader perspective so the finding data

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,590
also requires almost a suspicious set of

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,840
processing to make sure you know I know

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,730
these numbers correspond but are they

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,010
really the same thing do they really

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,900
make sense so I think it's an

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,030
augmentation of your understanding in

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,340
the capture capture of that process and

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,970
will data ever be self describing in the

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,220
metadata I mean can a I help with Kaylee

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,290
explaining what the data is and how its

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,450
derived I think it can I think it can

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,570
it's something we just have to choose to

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,000
focus on and then have standards around

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,380
those data formats so that they can be

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,990
exchanged and picked up by something

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,340
else that then adds to that knowledge

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,700
and as I say if we do this right

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,770
actually the contextual and metadata

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,390
around data is going to get bigger and

00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,670
actually become more valuable than the

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,920
original data so this is important for

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,870
everyone this isn't just about IBM oh no

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,740
this is Razoo world this is about

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,750
changing changing IT to bring data laps

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,340
would be a much more first-class aspect

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,170
to the platform you look at our

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,520
programming languages and the way the

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,100
systems are written it's all about the

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,270
processing but actually and then yes

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,760
almost dark data sir is a secondary

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,200
piece and it's owned by the system but

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,420
actually what we want to do is to say

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,990
actually data flowing across our

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,610
landscape and it needs to go with with

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,790
it with its description with its

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,830
metadata to enable a business to be data

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,320
driven rather than processed RIF unless

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,630
it's been in the past so iBM is a

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,890
classic example of a company that is

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:11,170
just immersed in data mm-hmm how you run

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,210
your business act and then immersed in

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,460
data and how you're working with your

00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:20,549
partners and customers okay so you've

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:23,440
got the internal need and the external

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,940
capability a whole people yeah so how do

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,110
those two come together I mean like

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,800
you're learning as you're going or yeah

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,650
and we work both sides so I work it for

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,360
our chief state office for so he was

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,610
actually partially looking internally

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,160
into IBM and how we we want our business

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,620
using data plus also a little of clients

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,540
and helping them were there and same

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,850
questions really how they do governance

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,890
how they find their data how they enable

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,190
people to think about data and so you

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,490
mentioned earlier data scientist is that

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,340
person different than the data analysts

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,710
that used to exist and has maybe morphed

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,570
and change their title and become data

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,820
scientist there's a core data

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,490
understanding and you know in an

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,410
understanding about all little traps of

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,780
it Berto found in data but the data

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,730
analyst is their job almost stops when

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,350
they understand that data the data

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,120
scientist is trying to build a new value

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,990
so they've got more of a business head

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,840
they've got they've got different

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,180
business use cases they tried to really

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,460
find something an interesting that's

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,280
going to then change the business them

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,200
you know give give people a new

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,390
perspective on things and then that same

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,030
data scientists also works with your

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,600
partners to help them solve their issues

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,330
and help them build solutions or is

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,660
there some sort of intermediary there or

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,860
tell you something in general when you

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,090
look at the data scientists work they

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,250
really understand the data they can

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,050
build algorithms those are going to be

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,700
useful that needs to go to a data

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,010
engineer to actually get it embedded

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,810
into the systems it needs to be the

00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,700
business analyst need to say ok how do

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,860
we change the way we work given this new

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,240
insight because you know the system can

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,590
come out with this brilliant you know

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,780
these are the customers you'd go after

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,940
nobody picks that list up and goes after

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,280
it and you know the data science isn't

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,430
giving you much value so often there's a

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,740
business change around data there's a

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,870
process change the way the applications

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,410
use the data as well as the core data

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,620
science that sits at the hospital so do

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:31,350
you see data significantly helping IBM

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:33,450
become a leaner meaner organization and

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,520
is data going to be something that

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,250
carries everyone through the future I

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,240
think it's going to get into only with a

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,810
very very complex organization that you

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,110
can imagine and so we do an awful lot of

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,699
data sharing we actually have a single

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,150
collaborative system that everybody's

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:54,160
sharing information on we have a lot of

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,039
consolidated systems in one way of doing

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,930
things across the world so it has been

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,550
an ongoing journey it's something that's

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,259
never going to stop really in terms of

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,590
how we transform and that use of data

00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:07,300
health sales I think I think the biggest

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,830
challenge is always changing people's

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,599
mindsets they're used to working on

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,970
their own gut feeling their experience

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,710
and then to actually get them to think

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,360
about well what data could I use how

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,849
could I make this better that's still

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,759
you know an ongoing education process

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:23,800
for so yeah I like that ongoing a lot of

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,210
people describe digital transformation

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,680
as something we're trying to achieve

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,750
yeah it's like they became digital and

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,610
yeah yeah so I think that's continual

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,120
transformation and we're on this cycle

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,280
of always from the very first let's

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,710
let's put em let's automate the payroll

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,650
all the way through to let's make sure

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,820
that everybody has sort of cognitive

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:50,020
type advisors around them helping them

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,940
understand the complexities of the

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,310
decisions that they're making so yes

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,900
we've really you know and I'm sure that

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,340
those in other ways that will come you

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,020
know in five years time are we saying oh

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,620
yeah now we've done cognitive let's do

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,900
something new so excellent so let's not

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,659
go five years ago let's let's back up to

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,940
if we have this conversation next year

00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:13,319
in London twelve months from now yeah

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:18,310
what's going to change for IBM and their

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:20,770
their use of data and their use of ml

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,360
and AI okay what's going to change in

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,479
that twelve months that you see

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,830
happening many things actually so what

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,719
one of the things we're doing is we've

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,930
got a big focus on open metadata and

00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:33,760
governance so we are helped have a

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,800
building or health emails out that

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,930
open-source project called Apache Atlas

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,680
which will give a foundation for how

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:45,279
method eita can be structured exchanged

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,680
and use in many applications we're going

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,690
to rebase our products on that we also

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,850
going to use it internally as we do a

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,130
lot more data-driven processing for our

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,460
own benefit but also alpha de Chasseur

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,170
- to customers so you can see you know

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,560
this will become an underpinning for how

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,990
we share and make better use of data on

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,750
the customer so again we're getting more

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,180
and more experience about how we help

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,910
them use use AI in their in their

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,950
processing and this is an Apache license

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,110
per hour so it's something you want

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,210
everyone to use absolutely yes that's

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,780
right so so all the contributions were

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,270
making our code and knowledge around how

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,640
you managed metadata contributions it's

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,970
everything we're doing the designs the

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,520
discussion it's all in public so anybody

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:37,200
can join excellent value we look forward

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,200
to that conversation journey thank you

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,720
