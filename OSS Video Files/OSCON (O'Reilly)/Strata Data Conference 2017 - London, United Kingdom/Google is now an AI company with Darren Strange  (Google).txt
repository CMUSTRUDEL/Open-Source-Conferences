hi this is Mike Hendrickson strata data

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,670
in London

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,040
I'm here with Darren from Google Darren

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,889
how you doing good yeah yes you gave a

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,360
keynote today and in that keynote you

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:18,510
talked about how important a I is to

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,130
Google what why what what is a I I mean

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,170
I think a lot of people are saying AI is

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:27,630
in their future but you're an AI company

00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,390
yeah Google's mission from the very

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,500
beginning was to organize the world's

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,530
information and make it universally

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,809
accessible and useful and this led us I

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,910
guess to do some of our best work was

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,190
trying to solve problems around big data

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,079
and that and that's been the history of

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,149
the company but you know now the kind of

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,250
problems that we need to solve to run

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,829
our own business are essentially AI

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,570
problems and the same pattern that we

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,699
followed all along where we divert

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,559
technology for ourselves to drive our

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,239
own business and then after it's been

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,090
battle-hardened for sometimes like 10

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,250
years making that external allowing

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,899
customers to user as well the same is

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,390
happening with AI so things that we're

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,850
developing for ourselves to be able to

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,530
do machine learning and models that were

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,600
building we're now making that available

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,939
to customers as well so we find

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,439
ourselves you know becoming an AI

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,689
company these are this is the future

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,070
this is where big data is headed this is

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,140
that these are challenges that are left

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,299
us all so you've been you guys have been

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,240
swimming Google's in data for a long

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,100
time what do we define as big or what

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,689
what is that all of a sudden big because

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,900
you guys have been working with massive

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,579
data sets all along and all of a sudden

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,860
we're now coming to a point to where

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,079
with IOT with cars with everything going

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,689
on are we finally getting to a point

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,180
where we can label it big it's huge I

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,180
mean the when I think back to the

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,670
initial paper of you know the business

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,969
proposal for Google I think it was based

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,000
on a model that said well if everyone

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,680
generates you know I think a few K of

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,939
data across the u.s. in a year I think

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,009
it was like eight hundred and 50

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,680
terabytes we might conceivably be able

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,869
to index if Moore's Law kept it up for

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,410
another 15 iterations who might just be

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,960
able to do it and you know

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:17,310
of course we've always confronted by

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,870
these you know incredible you know

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,100
mind-boggling numbers but yeah I mean at

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,200
Google it's a real problem because you

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,960
know big data ceases to be a very

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,420
meaningful as a qualifier so we just

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,700
tend to talk about data now and think

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,850
about things from a you know a cloud

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:37,810
hyper scale so the bigness of data is

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:40,270
leading us to AI but is it AI that's the

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,700
the important component or is a machine

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,250
learning or are they synonymous and

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,500
connected always well machine learning

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,600
is just a subset of the discipline is

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,760
artificial intelligence of course so

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,610
being able to predict an outcome from a

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,750
set of inputs or from or to identify and

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:03,010
classify something to common things and

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:05,920
but um yeah I think where we're coming

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,780
from a point where you know data is

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,670
having to not just look historically at

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,560
things that we don't just want to know

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,060
what just happened to us now we're

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,920
interested in solving problems that

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,110
wouldn't be great if the machines were

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,730
able to alert us to things that we were

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,350
able to learn about what might be about

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,910
to happen and other things where it's

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,620
very complicated for the human brain to

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,330
take in you know all kinds of different

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,670
parameters computers are really good at

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,320
that so certain kinds of problems become

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,520
possible to solve but it really just

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,990
weren't before

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,660
and so this is very exciting time to be

00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,540
in computer science so can could I ask

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,160
why do we call it artificial

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,890
intelligence I mean I mean to me it

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,070
seems like computers making sense out of

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:49,260
data and numbers should be like fact not

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:52,060
artificial I mean is is it just some

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,250
because it's not from our own brain yeah

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,900
I think that you've opened up a field of

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,870
existential thinking there that might be

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,459
a beyond my ability to sufficiently

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,650
articulate but yeah I think it's where

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,910
we're computers start to act in a way

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,459
that's indistinguishable from human

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,980
beings from something that makes us able

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,110
to understand you know difficult

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,940
concepts and a great example is when we

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,500
used to map languages from one to the

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,120
other we used to have to understand and

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,890
parse the languages and we used to make

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,500
a kind of a transfer or between those

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,609
but when we started to apply you know AI

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,370
techniques and machine learning

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,260
techniques to this we were able to

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,060
understand

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,950
the input that from one language and

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,950
even to a language that we hadn't mapped

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,930
to at all it was able to create you know

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,450
translation into that language that we

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,860
hadn't actually mapped directly it's as

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,050
if the machine itself had some

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,810
understanding of what the concept was in

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,660
a language neutral sense and was able to

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,610
then use the models to you know

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,020
articulate that in at the end as a

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,550
result so that's really quite an

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,460
astonishing thing when machines are

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,560
really able to learn and you know it

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,270
opens up possibilities of problems that

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,670
have seemed out of reach for many many

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,010
years and is something else enabling

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,290
that the cloud basically because before

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:08,010
it used to be done on a processor you

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,200
know CPUs or GPUs or whatever now with

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,390
the cloud are we more infinite in our

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,760
resources or what does that look like

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,830
exactly I mean the cloud is what's going

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,990
to make this not science fiction but

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,300
absolutely possible before we had the

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,820
cloud we weren't able to appropriate

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,550
these kinds of enormous computing

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,220
resources to you know for simple things

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,110
we weren't able to and quickly harness

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,820
millions of machines you need to think

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,500
about a problem building these models

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,260
there's an intensely computational

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,550
intensive task you know it doesn't it's

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,020
one thing to use a model but you're

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,270
actually building these models relies on

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,330
vast amounts of data so back to what is

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,660
Big Data you know the two parts of it

00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,760
being able to create a heuristic that

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,470
develops and is able to iterate over

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,870
time to be more accurate more accurate

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,490
possibly than a human being and that's

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,190
great and the data science involved in

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,230
that is key but you can't beat the size

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,180
of the data that it trains on it trumps

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,950
every time the amount of data that you

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,770
train on it is much more important

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:11,040
actually than the than the heuristic and

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,200
in terms of getting that to be more

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,580
accurate so you know Google finds itself

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,950
in a really strong position with this

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,600
because we've developed what is

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,750
essentially the clouds to drive all the

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,700
other you know billion user products

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,920
that we have that was to build our own

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,080
business and we ended up kind of

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,400
creating the cloud and so now that we

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,380
have that and we also have this

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,570
incredibly powerful resource of loads of

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,930
data to train on we're able to advance

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,230
this whole field both in photos in

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,600
speech in

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,210
actual language these are modalities

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,080
that we can now bring to technology so

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:50,830
can you disentangle I know Google's

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:54,280
all-in on AI and you have tensor tensor

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,980
flow and you have tensor processing

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,230
units yeah can you explain the three or

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,930
the four whatever that the package of

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,520
tensor stockers sure so I mean one of

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,990
those are saying the advantage of having

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,360
so much data is that we're able to

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,610
create models that no other company can

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,790
really do so if you think about it a bit

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,830
like a spectrum of complexity we want to

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,260
be able to provide pre-trained models

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,210
that are very very useful for key use

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,560
cases so things like you know so vision

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:28,900
API that you upload a photo we return a

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:30,460
JSON tree of metadata and that happens

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,900
in a few seconds so it's incredibly

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,490
quick you don't have to understand how

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,840
it works you have to scale the model you

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,240
don't have to worry about that you just

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,300
used the model so that's fantastic for

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,620
and you know these key fundamentals of

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,570
AI if you like speech and vision natural

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,550
language translation these kinds of are

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,110
now video intelligence API by the ways

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,480
and another one being able to do this

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,920
over videos tremendously powerful so

00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,750
that's great so that means you can start

00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,790
to build those models use those just out

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,150
of the box without any without having to

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:03,070
be an ml company really and but you

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,960
could use those to triage your oh you

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,730
know like a first stage and then go

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,110
deeper with your own models as well so

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:14,170
take for example say a retail company

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,300
that has a stock product the vision API

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,120
you could send it a photo and it might

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,520
return well this is a lamp but then you

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,960
could take the data from that and now

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,460
that you know it's a lamp you can start

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,110
to apply it or well which lamp is it

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,780
within our stock which SKU would it be

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,280
so what we hope it can do is you know

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,750
get you a long way down your own

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,479
modelling so then you might want to then

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,460
bring to that your own model so you may

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,290
want to train with a set of photos of

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,479
your own stock and take it further than

00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,979
that so so we think that what people

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,720
will do sometimes they'll just use the

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,970
you know the trained models and that's

00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,800
good but in a way that's kind of you

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,780
know in use cases it's fairly low orbit

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,430
you know what we want to get people to

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,790
think about too is being able to extend

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,920
that

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,200
their own data their own models so this

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,210
is where tensorflow came in technology

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,000
that's the most popular ml framework on

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,890
github now used by data scientists

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,050
really by default these days and

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,970
tensorflow enables you to build these

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,340
complex models using data science and

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,430
but also to manage those in a serverless

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,610
way so we've got you know on a cloud

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,540
portfolio want to provide service

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,280
products that allow you to use

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,100
technology like tensorflow

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,810
and other others like data lab as well

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,280
so being able to actually have a sort of

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,590
digital notebook about how you're

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,810
developing heuristic exchanging that

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,580
information with other scientists this

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,530
collaboration is absolutely crucial to

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,440
building these things well and then as

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,150
you as you mentioned that the M / TP

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,750
users a new innovation actually which

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,720
came out of the project with alphago

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,260
where we were using really pushing the

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,550
frontiers of what AI can really do and

00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,970
that was custom hardware that was able

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,920
to be optimized for the specific use

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,720
case of applying a machine learning

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,590
model now the new version we announced

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,060
last week io and cloud TP use this is

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,640
like the second version of this and it's

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,530
also built to optimize for and the

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,660
training aspect of data as well so you

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,700
can the training aspect of building as

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,660
models in you know intensely complex and

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,820
before we were only really able to use

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,170
that for the inference the usage of the

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,050
model piece but now we can do it for

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,640
both so these are specific pieces of

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,070
hardware optimized for this particular

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,530
kind of task they also have onboard and

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,630
network so they are very good at being

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,310
combined into large numbers of these all

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,480
together into what we call a pod which

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,750
is a bit like having a supercomputer

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,650
your disposal it can deliver something

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,720
like eleven and a half

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,630
Teta flops of collecting point

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,880
operations just mind-blowing amount of

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,620
computing power power that's optimized

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,890
for doing machine learning training and

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,440
inference stuff so we're going to that's

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,970
available now you can sign up for the

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,830
alpha of that but what we want is people

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,170
to be able to you know span the whole

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,620
spectrum from being able to use these

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,730
out-of-the-box pre-trained API all the

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,080
way through to building their own model

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,730
to even building you know highly

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,420
advanced pushing the frontier if they

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,900
decide in are these private

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,030
public or combination hybrids cloud-like

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,130
you run all this stuff all that this is

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,740
just part of Google compute engine so

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,290
it's going to be part of the public

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,510
service you determine if you were

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,170
sharing a public or just your own yeah

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,580
absolutely

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,470
right so this is the trainer model and

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,970
use the model and once you've got that

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,260
you're able to actually yet you can do

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,800
what you want with that with that yeah

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,200
of course

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,330
excellent so if you were to fast forward

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,790
12 months from now what would you like

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,430
to see happening in the AI marre in the

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:41,000
AI world because it's growing

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,040
tremendously and at a really super fast

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,430
rate where do you think we're going to

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,230
be in 12 months in this AI world since

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,050
you're now an AI company or yeah you

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,610
always have been but yeah yeah it's a

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,980
great question I think we will see

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,130
different things so one of the things I

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,230
want us all to think about it is really

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,750
showing respect to these new disciplines

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,480
you know it is an iterator what is a

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,970
progression I guess from from previous

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,010
eras but it is new as well and there's

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,840
there's disciplines we need to learn so

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,820
as computer scientists we need to

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,690
understand what data science is really

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:21,220
about you know so let's not just rebadge

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,120
you know traditional data analysis

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,070
nothing wrong with that but you know

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,870
let's understand the differences and

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,640
actually when we talk about data science

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,610
let's really be showing that we meet and

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,440
you know when when we see people talking

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,180
about their products let's not just like

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,340
rebadge traditional business

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,620
intelligence let's let's understand how

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,150
fundamentally profoundly different these

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,620
kinds of techniques are going to be and

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,940
with companies you know I think one of

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,480
the things in the next year we'll start

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,640
to see is this really interesting

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,100
interplay between the data engineer you

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,690
know who is writing code around building

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,330
pipelines and managing prepping data

00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:59,240
shaping that data making it useful for

00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,980
the company and this new breed of hires

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,260
which is this sort of data science

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,840
discipline which takes that further and

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,550
works on on kind of more academic models

00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,950
so I think companies are wrestling with

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,660
how to how to get the most out of both

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,220
of these different but important

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,050
disciplines in this new year so the data

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,990
engineer and the data scientist once

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,190
training data one's preparing the

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,110
pipelines and the

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,120
these and all that stuff yeah and

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,380
exactly and I think you know they're

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,700
coming from very different places you

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,890
know you've got your data engineer

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,760
typically someone who's a developer

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:34,190
who's comfortable programming and you

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,170
know in Java Scala or something like

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,820
that and they're thinking about agile

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,160
developments they typically used to

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,570
working on a two-week sprint and then

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,950
you're speaking to a data scientist

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,930
who's coming really from a very academic

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,090
discipline someone who's used to

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,030
thinking in a three year event horizon

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,680
around the PhD or you know I'm

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,630
exaggerating but you know they're more

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,420
that they're part of a science they

00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,190
issue papers for peer review and it's

00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,960
you know the elegance of the model is

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,460
what's really driving their interest so

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,560
we've got this very interesting

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,960
combination of these two disciplines and

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,930
you know and what I see is companies

00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,420
hiring both and struggling to understand

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,490
where to place them in the organization

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,300
how to even was the reporting life how

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,520
they work together

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,080
yeah and one key question we often ask

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,590
is you know what outcome are you looking

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,810
to optimize and we want to have people

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,730
think about that you know it's no use

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,590
bringing machine learning if you don't

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,110
know what it is you're you're wanting to

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:33,110
optimize for so this is getting clearer

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:36,350
about you know how a company wants to

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,510
develop what matters to it really and

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,210
how these technologies can be brought to

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,890
bear you need to move them forwards

00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,780
excellent Darin we look probably your

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,320
journey and thank you very world thank

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,320
you thank you

00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:55,439
