to change our lingo they talk about

00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,999
being a data subject so I am a data

00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,269
subject this is a local of the Dutch

00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:17,590
Data Protection Authority and as such

00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:18,189
while I am a data subject so are you so

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,570
is he

00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:25,750
so are we so are you all they are we are

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:29,009
all data subjects and the data ecosystem

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:34,570
that we created kind of looks like this

00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:37,200
so as a data subject I have rights data

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,899
subject rights to access portability

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,210
these are enforced certainly here in the

00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:48,359
in the UK by the ICO the Information

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:53,140
Commissioner's Office and these

00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:55,239
authorities ask organisations under the

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,180
gdpr to appoint data protection officers

00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,039
and above what we already know today to

00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,829
add another acronym to a couple of

00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,220
people we need in the company because

00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,470
these people have responsibilities as

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,990
companies as data controllers as the

00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,840
companies behind it data processors and

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,920
things like that so we are all data

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,979
subjects we play different roles in that

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,720
employees of companies but also

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:27,070
certainly for me as parents or

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,380
caretakers as consumers as customers men

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,460
and women young and old we are all part

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,979
of this ecosystem one way or another so

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,170
I don't want to share it's a pieces of

00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:42,130
legislation in this presentation just

00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:47,409
one one recital there are 99 articles in

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:49,270
the GDP are 173 rituals just one bit the

00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:53,530
processing of personal data should be

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:55,780
designed to serve mankind it goes on to

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,930
say that the right to the protection of

00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,939
personal data is not an absolute right

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,460
so we're not saying privacy is the most

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:06,369
important thing needs to be balanced

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,820
with other things and as our society is

00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,440
evolving we need to discuss that and see

00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,830
how we can do better to make sure that

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,630
we serve mankind one way or another

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,810
so you might have heard about the GDP

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,580
are the reason why most companies hear

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,900
about the GDP are is basically because

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,610
of the fines if you don't comply and

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,700
European Data Protection Board goes

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:34,180
after your company or the way you use

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,100
the data you can get fined up to four

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,010
percent of global turnover or twenty

00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,860
million euros that's an increased risk

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,630
that did not exist and still does not

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,220
exist today and will kick in in May two

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,440
thousand eighteen so I just want you to

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,300
think about this idea through the

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,700
conference the processing of personal

00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:01,420
data should be designed to serve mankind

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:04,140
that is the objective of the GDP are its

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,870
the objective is to align companies

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,910
employees people consumers customers to

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,910
