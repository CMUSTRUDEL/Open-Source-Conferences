	Peeking into the black box: Lessons from the front lines of machine-learning product launches

With advances in machine-learning algorithms and the democratization of big data technologies, machine-learning products have become ubiquitousâ€”they are the de facto choice for powering the experiences that are now common place in many of our beloved apps and services, such as recommendation and personalization. While offline evaluations are routinely done to evaluate algorithm performance, results from live experiments more closely reflects real-world performance and is a necessary step toward a product launch in many companies. However, running experiments on machine-learning products poses unique challenges and requires consideration beyond what traditional experiments frameworks offer.

Grace Huang shares lessons learned from running and interpreting machine-learning experiments and outlines launch considerations that enable sustainable, long-term ecosystem health.

	00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,359
as I was preparing this talk I was

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,360
thinking back in my previous training as

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,420
a computational biologist and it occurs

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,680
to me that all these anti patterns are

00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,330
symptoms of a failure to think of

00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,640
machine learning product as a living

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,839
organism so there are a few interesting

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,419
qualities of a living organism they grow

00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:26,160
they maintain a homeostasis which is

00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:28,409
like a relatively stable equilibrium

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,259
with the system and they adapt to the

00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:32,460
environment and in very much the same

00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,760
way I think that machine learning

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,410
products need to have these qualities

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,860
your model needs to be able to come that

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,360
growth both in your users in your data

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,770
and more importantly you need to be able

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,140
to accommodate the growth in the

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,550
complexity of your model so over time

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,100
you're going to build up your features

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,290
from hundreds to thousands to tens of

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,860
thousands are you able to handle that

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,900
level of redundancy and sometimes a

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,530
technical debt that comes with it and

00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,170
and do you have a way to retire your

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,240
model do you have a way to age them

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,460
gracefully so that you can at one point

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,700
replace them with another model with

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,310
relative ease

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,140
second of all does your model have a wet

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,140
way or a mechanism to maintain a

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,659
relatively stable environment and by

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,249
that I also mean do you have a way to

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,859
building a negative controlling your

00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:28,770
system such that your model is

00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,139
relatively robust against perturbations

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,499
in your data against corruption your

00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:37,710
data and again this effect where rich

00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:39,600
gets richer where you know certain

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,409
initial effects with noble into

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,619
something that is amplified to again and

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:48,299
finally does your model have a way to

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:51,450
adapt to this dynamic and shifting

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,209
environment that whirring your users

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,819
will grow and will drift over time can

00:01:54,209 --> 00:02:00,420
your model handle that sort of growth

00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,179
and evolution through time and your

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,009
product will probably pivot and will go

00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:07,979
through different changes in the product

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,409
market shift it's your model ready to

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,130
handle that sort of pivot or ultimate

00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:15,300
goal that you're trying to with us

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,300
