	00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,340
so we were making breakfast for the kids

00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:08,050
the other day and I said to my wife I

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,360
know what I'm going to talk about at

00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,719
strata I'm going to talk about how

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,720
Google has become an AI company I must

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,150
explain at this point my wife's a vet so

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,460
she looks up from cleaning up some spilt

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,420
Cheerios and she says what's a googles

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,160
into artificial insemination now I which

00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,500
point my nine-year-old pipes up daddy

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,770
what exactly is artificial insemination

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,540
and then realized this talk was going in

00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,060
a direction I hadn't exactly planned and

00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,770
but it revealed to me that actually

00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,810
we're doing a terrible job sometimes of

00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,550
explaining how artificial intelligence

00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,550
and machine learning is going to

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,340
profoundly change everyday lives of all

00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,649
of us and so wondering is this time to

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,510
challenge myself challenge us to think

00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:57,250
about what role we want to play in

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:59,770
shaping this future now when we as a

00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,360
species went to the moon everyone

00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,290
assumed the very next thing we do is go

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,049
to Mars right but it didn't happen

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,150
instead we decided what we would do is

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,610
launch satellites we invented you know

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,380
the Space Shuttle we dispense with the

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,869
Ariane 5 that would have taken us there

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,369
we we got on with other things we built

00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,950
the space station and all of that was

00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:23,020
great but in that we kind of lost that

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,630
dream that somewhere along the line of

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,260
conquering the galaxy and going to other

00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,299
planets and here's what I think you know

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,610
I think being in computer science can

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,740
sometimes feel a bit like this you know

00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,090
that we we feel like that the biggest

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,220
problems have kind of already been

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,170
solved and that we're left even if we

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,760
don't admit it kind of tinkering around

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,189
the edges a little bit solving

00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,590
optimizing but the really cool problems

00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,479
the really audacious things feel like

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,479
they're too far away they're sort of out

00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,909
of reach you know like science fiction

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,009
but now of course you know NASA

00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:00,130
companies like SpaceX tell us we could

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:03,220
be on Mars by 2022 and you know machine

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:07,299
learning and AI is for us a chance to

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,270
transform the world and as we stand on

00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,770
the

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:15,980
brink of really what is a new revolution

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:23,510
we have to think about how this can

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:27,770
transform companies now you know

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,690
Google's part in this whole play for our

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,360
part I think we can't do our best work

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,040
really when we think about solving

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,290
intractable computer science problems

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,720
and you know it was that that I think

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,160
led to some of our best work around you

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,080
know inventing the thinking around what

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,460
led to big data and ultimately the cloud

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,920
you know and for us the cloud has become

00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,300
the way that we can we can take we can

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,170
solve some of these problems it's the

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,570
cloud that's going to make the

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,390
difference to reaching these problems

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,740
that fell out of reach and for our part

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,280
we're building a cloud that's really

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,590
optimized for this AI future and we're

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,150
doing you know for example last week we

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,730
talked about the release of our cloud

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,430
GPUs attentive processing units and

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,500
these are incredible optimized pieces of

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,930
hardware that can deliver in a pod

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,420
eleven-and-a-half petaflop sub computing

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,380
power and this is computing power that

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,670
is optimized for doing training and

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,040
inference of machine learning modeling

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,750
now previously these kinds of things our

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,650
models would take safer vision would

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,210
take us you know a whole whole day to

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,620
process one of those models now we're

00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,650
able to do that in just an afternoon

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,030
with 1/8 of the number of processes and

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,510
this is faster than anything you can do

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,030
on CPU or GPU including the new chips

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,160
that Nvidia release so really quite

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,860
exciting stuff more than that we're

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,690
infusing all of our products with with

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,610
an AI field if you want to hear more

00:03:50,690 --> 00:04:00,440
about that come to my talk a bit later

00:03:52,610 --> 00:04:03,920
today when the PC first came out the

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,240
last kind of a big revolution you know

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,920
the very first application that people

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,300
wrote it was a VT 100 terminal emulator

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,170
you know it was as if people were trying

00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,280
to use the future to recreate the past

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,720
you know and I see the same kind of

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,820
thing happening again and it took you

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,560
know windows and the Macintosh to teach

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,210
us how to use that technology

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,639
see this happening already again with AI

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,520
you know what we see is data analysts

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,500
perfectly respectable job being you know

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,750
rebadging themselves as data scientists

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,950
without really using without going to

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,330
learn and show respect to that

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,180
discipline and understanding what that

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,800
really means you know and we see

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,470
companies traditional bi companies

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,870
peddling this kind of a IML thing with

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,460
here with extra AI without really

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,919
understanding how that's so

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,870
transformational so I you know I want to

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,430
ask us not to be that guy let's not be

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,380
that that that role and let's challenge

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,360
ourselves I want to kind of leave this

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,889
with you that let's take time this

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,139
conference not to leave without

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,370
understanding some of these fundamental

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,870
you know new technologies we've got

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,580
really good talks at different levels

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,990
whatever level we're at whether you're

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,000
beginning or whether you're a very deep

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,010
expert already take advantage of these

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,810
we'd love to talk to you we've got our

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,000
booth we'd love we've got some demos and

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,300
code labs come by we'd love to chat to

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,960
you

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,710
and so my nine-year-old unable to get a

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,740
good answer

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:28,190
turns to turns away from us and she says

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,740
hey Google what's AI and there the

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,229
computer started to teach her and maybe

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,960
that's a glimpse of the future so join

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,479
with me let's make sure that we play our

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,350
role in this this new moonshot for all

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,839
of us thank you

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,839
