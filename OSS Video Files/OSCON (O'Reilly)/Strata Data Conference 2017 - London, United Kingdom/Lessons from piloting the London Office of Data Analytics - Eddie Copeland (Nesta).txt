Title: Lessons from piloting the London Office of Data Analytics - Eddie Copeland (Nesta)
Publication date: 2017-05-25
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	As the British capitalâ€™s boroughs and public sector bodies seek to meet spiraling demand in the face of reduced budgets, the London Office of Data Analytics, a collaboration between the Greater London Authority, Nesta, and ASI Data Science, is exploring the potential of applying data analytics to reform public services. Eddie Copeland shares lessons learned from piloting the London Office of Data Analytics.

The pilot program focused on using data to predict the location of properties rented out to multiple tenants where the landlord has failed to obtain the correct license. There are estimated to be tens of thousands of these unlicensed houses of multiple occupancy (HMOs) across London, but only a small minority are correctly licensed, representing a loss of revenue for local authorities and often presenting dangerous living conditions for vulnerable tenants. Eddie explores how the team at the London Office of Data Analytics overcame the barriers to joining up, analyzing, and acting upon public sector data at city scale to address this important challenge.

	00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,300
London skyline beautiful isn't it

00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:11,380
yeah underneath some of those rooftops

00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:14,950
lies a hidden problem vulnerable tenants

00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,720
being exploited by rogue landlords now

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,300
that problem manifests itself in many

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,900
different ways the one specific instance

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,109
concerns something we call unlicensed

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,659
HMOs and HMOs fans for house of Multiple

00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:31,089
Occupation and it's a property that's

00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:33,490
rented out to multiple tenants they're

00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:35,560
on separate contracts but they share say

00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,480
the kitchen and the bathroom now the

00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,370
landlord needs a very specific license

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,520
in order to be able to have such a

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,380
property this sounds trivial I'm not

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,490
just talking about the need for

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:52,300
paperwork unlicensed HMOs are concerning

00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:54,460
for three big reasons number one they

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,360
are linked to some of the most dangerous

00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,070
living conditions in the capital today

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,140
number two you may all be aware that

00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,150
English local authorities are under

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,280
extraordinary financial pressure right

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,350
now in any properties that they're not

00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,569
licensing they're not getting the income

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,369
for and that's income that should be

00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,530
going towards supporting public services

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:17,499
supporting the communities that we all

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,439
live in and lastly it's not exactly as

00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:22,749
if this is a minor issue in scale each

00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,499
London borough may have up to fifteen

00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:28,060
thousand HMOs and only ten to twenty

00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:31,060
percent of them are thought to be

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,759
correctly licensed so the question is is

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,069
there a way that we can help local

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,350
authority building inspectors go around

00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:40,420
this great capital find more of those

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,299
buildings protect more vulnerable

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,880
tenants bring in more income what

00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:48,700
perhaps you can perhaps you can do it

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,119
with data which leads me to the next

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,909
slide if that can be brought up our

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,979
pilots for a London office of data

00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:59,229
analytics which we have been working

00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,029
with the GLA at the Greater London

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,630
Authority whose rather remarkable

00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:06,039
offices you see in this picture we've

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,560
been working with an amazing data

00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,320
science team called the ASI and twelve

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,319
London boroughs and the idea behind it

00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,569
has been to see can we tackle a problem

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,579
that doesn't just affect HMOs but is

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,989
relevant for lots of different issues

00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:24,969
affecting this great city and it's this

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,579
for the majority of public services

00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:30,370
London's data is like a jigsaw that's

00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:32,620
never been put together every

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,260
organization has their little piece but

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,980
no one can put the pieces together thank

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,159
you very much take a step back and see

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,870
what that picture am shows now that's a

00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,689
big problem when we bear in mind that

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,299
right now public services need to find

00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:51,700
ways to deliver more and better with

00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,799
less and many of the tried and tested

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,949
the proven ways of doing that are

00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,239
hindered by the fragmentation of public

00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:01,269
sector data let me give you three

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,209
examples number one doesn't sound very

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,739
exciting but shared services the idea

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,049
that local authorities that neighbor

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:11,079
each other could share resources teams

00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:13,449
assets infrastructure to save money and

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,459
deliver and a better outcome and if

00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:18,340
they're done well they can deliver those

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,530
things but here's the problem you'll

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,810
find one local authority has got amazing

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,449
data on its own issues its own

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,729
challenges its own demand but if it

00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:30,280
cannot see the scale of all those things

00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:32,620
on the other side of the boundary if it

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,819
doesn't have that data how are they

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,769
meant to have a sensible conversation

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:38,530
with their neighbors as to whether they

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,989
could do more shared services a second

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,579
issue or a second opportunity for better

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,949
ways of working would be to

00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,169
intelligently coordinate the actions of

00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,030
different teams and this is very

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,949
relevant for some of our most complex

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,620
challenging and expensive public

00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,989
services like adult and child social

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,969
care you might end up with 30 separate

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,189
teams 30 separate organizations all

00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,840
working together to support one

00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:04,479
vulnerable family one vulnerable

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,150
individual how can they do that

00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:10,269
effectively if they do not have data on

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,639
what each other are doing and thirdly

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,060
and perhaps most importantly of all the

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,049
idea of prediction and Prevention

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,840
intervening in problems when they're

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,240
small when minimum harm has been caused

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,610
when frankly issues are cheaper to

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,770
resolve because if you think about it

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,400
the default mode of most public services

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,580
today

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,160
is to address failure after it happens

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,280
okay we go and sort out this giant great

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,070
pile of fly tipping after there's trash

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,470
on the ground I go to the doctor when I

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,139
already have relatively severe symptoms

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,780
and worst of all if you think in some

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,850
cases domestic violence victims do not

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,180
get the support they need until several

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,919
very damaging incidents have occurred

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,680
now we know we can predict and prevent

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,500
but only if you can bring together data

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,180
sets so that they can collectively point

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,180
