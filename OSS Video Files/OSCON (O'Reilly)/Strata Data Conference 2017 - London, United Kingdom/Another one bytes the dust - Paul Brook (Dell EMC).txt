hey hi everyone I'm Paul brook from Dell

00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:08,790
EMC come and see us on booth 103 as your

00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,990
musical introduction

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,000
gosh I'm kind of figuring you don't care

00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,430
that I work for deli MC you're looking

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,060
for the next important keynote what we

00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:21,220
want to do in these next few minutes is

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,529
talk about something that we dug up from

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,480
a presentation for a few years ago we've

00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:27,159
retired it because the customer in

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,720
question had been bored they were based

00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:30,550
right here in London but they've been

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,309
bought by a household name so we thought

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,469
we'll put that on the shelf to go where

00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:38,199
presentations and case studies go to die

00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:41,890
but actually we got thinking after I was

00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:43,690
reading I was reading the book Moneyball

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,329
some of you may know the film about the

00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,070
Oakland Athletics who used data to

00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,800
improve the quality of their team as

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,530
opposed to using the hunches and guesses

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,789
that the scouts and the baseball experts

00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:59,409
pulled in and what we were looking at is

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,100
here's an example of where if you use

00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:05,170
traditional data points things that

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,930
you've trusted maybe for many years in

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,380
the modern world you may be making one

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,570
big mistake but there's another one

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,510
bites the dust the song another one

00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,490
bites the dust penned by John Deacon

00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,120
performed by Queen seven million records

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:25,360
and still going ran out at about three

00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,070
minutes 52 seconds so I'm figuring with

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,870
a keynote like this I've got time for a

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,590
bit of an advert break so here's my

00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:35,200
advert and if you get the chance get

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,300
along to quarry Minton's presentation

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,330
there's the title of it's at capital

00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,330
suite for the machines I'm talking about

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,160
quarries going to show you how we design

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,350
them architect them how you can tune

00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,830
them instrument and how you can really

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,150
build the vol volume that you need

00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,610
whether that's a cloud platform and

00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,880
on-premise platform or we believe will

00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,860
be a hybrid platform now to the music

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,450
industry I need you to go with me on a

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,300
few things the first thing I need you to

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,280
go with me on is are you comfortable

00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,090
that the music industry has changed a

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,730
wee bit and if you're working musician

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,769
you're more likely to earn

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,470
money so you can buy your big house in

00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:19,659
the country through touring you're good

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,909
with that see a few nods at the front

00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:24,700
you're good with that and I obviously

00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,049
acts like a dowel and they still sell a

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,180
lot of records but Touring's where

00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:30,459
you'll make your money and do you think

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,170
it's reasonable if I say that if you're

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,360
on the bottom of the bill there with the

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,549
glee club tribute act you're going to

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,590
earn less money touring than you are if

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,060
you're Beyonce or Kings of Leon you're

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,030
good that being top of the bill is a

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,739
good thing well if you're comfortable

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,870
with that when I'm walk you through now

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,269
is the first thing I need from you I

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,319
want you all to imagine you are a

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:55,930
musician in a band and if that becomes

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,500
your worst nightmare and it even gets

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,670
worse I'm your manager now alice is kind

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,920
of talking to you about wanting to

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,480
manager but I've been around a while I'm

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,370
a pretty old guy I've managed some big

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,709
acts and I've said to you guys I've got

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,840
you a European tour of festivals now

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,700
after my fees you're not going to earn

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,849
much money but look at the audience

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,880
you'll attract so you go for it I'm

00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,609
going to tell you an extreme example so

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,410
you come out on stage so wet Friday

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:24,940
morning

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,120
are you expecting to stand up in front

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,510
of man and a dog and what you get is

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,549
80,000 people the minute you leave banjo

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,620
player you kind of see what band I like

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,680
the lead guitarist strikes the first

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:43,660
note there's a mosh pit that can be seen

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,660
from space even during the drum solo yes

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,880
you allow your drummer a jump solo the

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,880
audience again boop-boop at the right

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,810
moment I won't make you go whoop you can

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,669
if you want to it's a free country at

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,230
the end of the gig it's like Adele was

00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:01,150
at Glastonbury if any of you saw it what

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,129
a fantastic performance your singers

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,260
kind of like Freddie Mercury holding out

00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:07,810
the microphone people are singing you

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,620
out as you walk offstage you've just had

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,870
my friends the best gig of your life you

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,359
need to fire me your manager because I

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,120
have cost you thousands

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,590
Alistair comes on and he's been busy

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,340
renegotiating with the next tour fest

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,190
the next

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,020
festival and he says here's the problem

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,970
we don't sell a lot of records and are

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,700
making this bit up but if you add our

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,669
Facebook and Twitter band fans there's a

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,070
billion of them on YouTube we've been

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,470
played two billion times if you look at

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,620
Spotify at least one of our tracks is on

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,990
80% of everyone's playlist in fact two

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,900
of our tracks are on 50% of everyone's

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,090
playlist we are you are the most

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,310
illegally downloaded band in the world

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,620
which means you're hot to trot you

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,740
should be top of the bill if you just

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,540
look at selling records you as an

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,960
individual musician have lost about a

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,400
million dollars a night and that my

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,410
friends is the power of the technology

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,910
you're working with whether it's the

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,700
machines being trained to make the

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,530
decision or whether it's people making

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,110
decisions supported by the technology

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,850
you're developing on let's not forget

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,620
that it can change the world it can

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,680
change all of us come and talk to us

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,060
tell EMC at booth 103 I've been rubbish

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:29,040

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:29,040
