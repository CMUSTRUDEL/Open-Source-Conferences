Description: 
	We are more mobile now than ever. Although we use our mobile devices to optimize our time and do more anytime, anywhere, our apps are still too slow and cannot cope with our fast-paced lifestyle. Javier Garza details the ingredients you need to build and deliver an amazing app your users will love.

	00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,899
good morning everybody my name is Javier

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,820
I'm going to quickly introduce myself in

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,610
a few seconds and then I'm going to

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,160
share with you the secret for building

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,950
and delivering amazing web apps at a

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,580
scale are you guys ready awesome

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:23,820
ok quick intro bot myself I am a very

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,280
active geek that works at a very cool

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,960
company and the company name is called

00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,510
Akamai you know I could talk for hours

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,510
about Akamai but not today so we are

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,589
going to move on with the secret all

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,989
right if you've been in a bus or in a

00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:42,510
room full of people like this one you

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,399
probably notice something you know

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,559
people are constantly staring at the

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:52,260
phones here in the US a normal user has

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,469
around 90 apps installed on the on their

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,899
devices but from those ninety they only

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,839
get to use around nine on a daily basis

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,989
and that's what you call the favorite

00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:06,780
apps I've been working at Akamai for

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,450
around 14 years with some of the largest

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,780
companies in the world who create those

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,939
top apps and they have learned that to

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:22,590
make an amazing app you have to optimize

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:26,729
three different things first the front

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,890
end second the back end and the third

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,329
the network right three different areas

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,880
not in this order but doesn't matter

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,430
three areas I'm going to see in detail

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,070
what can you do to optimize each of

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,770
these three areas on the front end there

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,259
are five things I would do the first of

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,240
all is a beautiful interface you want to

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,119
have an amazing beautiful interface that

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,450
people who love and that is accessible

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,460
so anybody can use it it needs to be

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,859
aware of the network conditions to adapt

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,130
if the network is low or if you are

00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:02,969
offline and it needs to be secure if you

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,740
want to keep your users trust and the

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:09,629
most important one at least for me is

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:13,050
speed I want an app that it starts

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:14,280
instantly and that performs well all the

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,130
time

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,800
so that was the very first area on the

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,600
second is the back end on the back end

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,990
you want to have a distributed

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,660
infrastructure so your servers are your

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,840
apps are always up even if one data

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,750
center goes down it needs to auto scale

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:38,040
it needs to perform always even when you

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:41,040
have peak usage performance budget it

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,930
means your software developers they are

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,170
aware of the performance as they code

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,570
all right right from the beginning

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:51,600
continuous monitoring means you have

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:53,430
measures in place to monitor for

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,400
availability and performance for a

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,100
change on those all the time and you

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,440
have tools to act quickly if something

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,330
happens and DevOps is very important

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,260
it's all about optimizing like you can

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,320
see on my t-shirt

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,959
I love optimizing it consists on

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,500
automation integration and collaboration

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,080
between software developers and other IT

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,640
professionals on the company alright

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:28,019
ready for the last one so we have the

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,480
network DNS as you have heard a few

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,610
minutes ago it's super important it's

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,500
critical and can't be a catastrophic

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,549
single point of failure so have a good

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,269
DNS you should use newer DN and newer

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,980
protocols like for example a CB - that

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,940
can give you a lot of performance boost

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:52,260
with almost no implementation effort and

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:55,829
latency latency is a physical limitation

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,680
of nature so the further award you have

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,920
the server's from the users the slower

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,600
things get alright so the secret for him

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,269
reducing the latency is putting the

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,340
servers where your end-user your where

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,100
your end-users are by using a cloud

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:16,470
delivery platform all right so let's

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,329
recap to create and to build and deliver

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,549
amazing apps or the scale you need to

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,479
optimize three years on the front end

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,250
you need a beautiful user interface that

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:33,360
is accessible

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:36,300
is secure that is can that is secure and

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,870
can be aware of the network conditions

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,260
on the back end you need to use a

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,110
distributed infrastructure that out of

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,630
scale that is code to perform from the

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:52,650
beginning that is continuously monitor

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:55,130
using debuffs best practices on on the

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,950
network side you need to have a good DNS

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,480
ACB - and a good cloud delivery platform

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,600
to bring your servers close to the

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,120
end-users and reduce the latency gap all

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,010
right that's it that's a secret and if

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,470
you want to learn more about this you

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,400
