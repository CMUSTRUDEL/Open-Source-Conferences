hi this is Mike Hendrickson from bossy

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,339
2018 in San Jose

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm here with Denali from Vox how you

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,190
doing great how are you good so what do

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,099
you do a box so I'm director of

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,590
engineering for the enterprise group at

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,100
box we have four different orgs within

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,720
engineering focus on different users we

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,260
have one group that is focused on

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,910
developer API basically all of the

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,240
features and software needed for people

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,560
who want to build software on top of box

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,860
we have another group focused on the

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,170
actual end-user people who are you know

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,590
using uploading files using the website

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,200
mobile etc we have another group focused

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,200
just on generic platform services that

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,200
are needed for any software system

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,300
storage messaging networking etc and

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,550
then we have the enterprise group and we

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,800
are focused on features and products for

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,660
the IT admin and the chief information

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,649
security officer so people who are

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,439
concerned about compliance security cost

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,119
management and basically deploying box

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,439
for their company so people like the

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,170
people who are here at this velocity

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,610
event that's right that's right yeah so

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,680
are you meeting good people here is this

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,799
like the tribe that would be a box

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,659
enterprise customer it does it does feel

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,430
that way and actually in the recruiting

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,630
booth talking with people we need to be

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,040
careful because we have a lot of

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,400
customers but we also see a lot of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,650
people we'd like to hire so that's good

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,810
probably right right right so what is

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,280
your day-to-day look like in box if

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,150
you're the director of engineering I

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,220
mean what what hits your plate so right

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,110
now I think the big focus for me I've

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,329
actually just joined in the past three

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,270
months I'm so I'm still relatively new

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,850
at box but the big focus for me has been

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,820
on really building a strong staff so

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,680
that we can perform and then really kind

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,960
of move the needle and and really

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,549
succeed with our product but in order to

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,380
do that we need to have a healthy staff

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,460
so it's been a lot of work around

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,530
recruiting and how to make that more

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,229
efficient and more optimized and how to

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,390
innovate there we've introduced some new

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,310
programs and some new approaches that

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm super excited about that I think

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,990
will help us find talented P

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,510
well outside of sort of the you know the

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,510
standard pools that too traditionally

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,280
people look at and then beyond that

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,200
we'll move into we've already started

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,080
moving into also focusing on retention

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,930
so you know staff is just like any other

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,480
business problem you know getting a

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,460
strong pipeline of sales incoming

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,230
doesn't really mean anything if there's

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,890
a certain percentage of churn Iliff

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,260
right right

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,570
and in fact existing employees are you

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,070
know just like existing customers are

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:49,590
more valuable over time so retention

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,660
programs around essentially training the

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,120
management team in terms of how to be

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,210
excellent managers in a more formal way

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,640
I think management is one of those

00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,470
interesting fields where it's very

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,020
unique there's there's just not a lot of

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,570
formal training that's really given and

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,100
sort of you know clear tools what makes

00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,170
a good manager what makes a bad manager

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,900
most people can't even really answer

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,790
that question they don't know and I'd

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,340
say that a good manager is someone who

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,470
can hire and retain staff and meet the

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,340
business goals so let me ask you about

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,990
good and bad what's a good candidate

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,370
when you see because you sit down with

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,650
that's a great question engineering

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,170
what's a good candidate like that's a

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,900
great question so I my whole perspective

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,420
on the recruiting industry is that it's

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,060
ripe for disruption and there's you know

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,240
tons of inefficiency and waste and in

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,030
terms of both time and money and the way

00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,660
that we're approaching hiring is is

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,280
definitely non optimal and I have lots

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,680
of thoughts in terms of where to improve

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,180
and how to how to do that but for me

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,480
when I look at candidates what I'm

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,310
actually mostly interested in is the

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,440
ability to learn and to grow and to

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,550
improve there's this fascinating

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,400
research that's been done at Stanford

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,380
about the growth mindset which is

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,910
something that we've you know we're

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,780
learning more about with children in

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,850
different and different communities and

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,350
groups across the country high school

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,090
students but I think the same thing can

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,120
apply for professional workers and

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,770
adults as well which is not just for the

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,840
individual but also for the company in

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,850
the organization which is how do you

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,540
approach failure and you can actually

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,180
understand

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,660
a lot about the real values and ethics

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,180
of a company immediately after there's

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,930
been a very large failure what happens

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,550
in that moment and so you know trying to

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,980
find people who are comfortable with

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,600
failure who can learn and improve those

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,940
are the people you want to hire and so

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,280
you elicit failure out of them like in

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,500
your interview questions I asked them

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,430
what it what is your biggest the biggest

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,980
epiphany when you failed I try to I try

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,630
to talk through you know past

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,940
experiences that people have had that

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,490
are both good and bad and get a sense of

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,230
what was the kind of flexibility and

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,870
what was the dynamic in terms of after

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,880
this failure how did they improve her or

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,490
move forward yeah for sure

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,890
so how important are technical chops as

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,060
well I mean do you want someone with a

00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,370
really solid technical pedigree so a

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,380
technical skill is important it's also

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,360
sort of dependent on the team so you

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,460
want you know a healthy team dynamic and

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,170
that's can be supported by having a

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,140
variety of different levels and skills

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:37,260
and so typically you know one one common

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,480
failure pattern that we see in industry

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,820
is especially for startups as you know

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,350
it's much easier to hire more junior

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,630
folks than it is to hire more senior

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,010
folks typically and you can over hire

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,170
and you can have these you know teams

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,600
and groups of really amazing junior

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,160
developers but none of them have really

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,110
kind of gone through the experience of

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,230
scaling a system or understand the

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,410
importance of you know architecture test

00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:03,120
automation see ICD the investments that

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,760
we make now and how they sort of impact

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,370
the future so you definitely find these

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,530
companies that have succeeded as

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,360
startups and moved into more kind of

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,790
mid-sized companies that now have these

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,850
just tremendous problems around

00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,140
technical debt and architecture lack of

00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,580
architecture that then need to be

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,690
addressed and they're much more costly

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,820
so I think the the key to technical

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,380
skill is really to think holistically

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,510
about the team and what the team needs

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,230
and make sure that you have an even

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:37,200
distribution junior mid and senior level

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,880
experience and your team's get to learn

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,910
and use all sorts of different

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,980
technologies because you're interfacing

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,540
with a lot of enterprises that have a

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,670
lot of different technologies in play

00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,550
that you're interacting with is that

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:53,120
true or so I think actually to be honest

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:56,290
we have sort of a legacy monolith system

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,150
written in PHP we have a little bit of

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,040
software written in Scala from about ten

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,860
years ago when that was hip don't blame

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,750
them but most of the stuff we're doing

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,030
now is actually either in Java or

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,150
JavaScript with the node as we're moving

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,400
into a services architecture with Java

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,260
or JavaScript being sort of the primary

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,210
supported languages and I actually think

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,830
that's the right approach I've worked at

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,660
companies where it's like you know

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,390
choose any language choose any framework

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,550
that suits you you know go have fun and

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,580
I think it's actually much more

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,870
efficient to standardize on the

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,040
languages that make sense for the

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,620
problems that you're dealing with

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,780
because it kind of allows you to then

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,480
standardize on the development

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,760
environment and the IDE and the release

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,110
process and sort of the tools that can

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,810
then be built in to support the

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:49,190
developers around linting testing error

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,970
you know throttling failover logging all

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,620
these things that need to be done well

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,690
and but that aren't really part of sort

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,110
of the core application business logic

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,020
so I think standardizing on languages

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,140
and technologies allows the business to

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,640
provide those templates and that support

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,560
so that the developers can move faster

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,050
and just focus on the actual business

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,910
problem and you guys have R&D going on

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,930
in parks as well like you have an RD

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,880
group I think we would say that we have

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,180
a build organization which is composed

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,680
of engineers and product managers and

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,169
this would be considered the Rd group

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,780
okay yeah excellent so if you look

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,240
forward at that box in the next like

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,539
let's say six months what do you want to

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,070
see change for your enterprise

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,039
engineering team what would you like to

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,690
see change in the next six months so in

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,750
the next six months what I'm hoping to

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,390
do is help the team to really become

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,610
outstanding both with with hiring and

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,990
with training and how we interact with

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,940
each other giving immediate feedback

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,530
both positive and negative

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,040
this is a simple thing that we should do

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,750
that most most companies still don't do

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,330
we had a whole training radical candor

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,380
yeah exactly so helping people be

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,050
comfortable with that because it's very

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,140
hard right have especially negative

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:13,130
feedback can be extremely scary but how

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,750
do we get honest feedback right yeah so

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,330
getting the team in a really solid place

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,180
and then helping us move forward such

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,320
that we're putting equal emphasis on

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,570
enterprise-grade software development

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,340
and value to the customer and doing that

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,020
every sprint every two weeks so

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,690
basically making sure that we're

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,210
shipping sort of a balance of doing

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,330
things with excellence again with in

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,160
terms of you know security quality

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,440
reliability all of these things but also

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,920
making sure that we're delivering value

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,050
to the customer quickly I'm really

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,160
excited about box because I'm very

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,230
bullish on box

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,430
maybe not for some of the reasons that

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:55,130
are you know being discussed or covered

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,700
recently around AI and skills but more

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:01,870
because I've spent about 20 years

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,000
working in industry in both quality and

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,960
security and I see a very clear trend

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,390
coming which is just a very you know

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,880
clear increase in cyber attacks in both

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,390
frequency and also depth and

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,570
effectiveness and I also see kind of the

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,900
the legislature across you know the

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,490
world coming up with ways to try and

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,910
mitigate this and ways to you know

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,070
create laws that help us manage you know

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,990
protection of data and protection of

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,360
people and you know protection of

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,950
software and so I see this as sort of a

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,190
growing arms race actually that will

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,010
just continue and intensify and become

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,640
bigger and bigger and so the idea that

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:49,390
there's this there's a product like box

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,470
that companies can leverage and use

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,750
especially if they're not you know sort

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,790
of at their core technology companies

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,950
that can offer these services that

00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,810
basically say you know we've taken care

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,690
of all of the compliance requirements if

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,490
you use box we make it seamless and easy

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,520
to you know

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,230
compliant right or socks or hippo or GXP

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,959
or any of the other like you know

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,580
vertical specific regulations and

00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,500
additionally we have all of these

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,779
additional security capabilities that

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,670
you can turn on easily for a defense

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,640
in-depth strategy where you just have

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,370
safety nets at every point to help

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,680
protect the business so to me that seems

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,450
like a super high value thing that

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,399
people will be willing to pay for that

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,470
will be really helpful as we move

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,290
forward in this sort of changing

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,149
landscape of cyber security all that in

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,850
six months at school quite a quick

00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,740
journey well yeah one step at a time but

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,120
yeah excellent well we look forward to

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,120
that journey with you thank you thanks

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,040
