Description: 
	The internet versus your sites: Taking action against internet volatility (sponsored by Oracle Dyn) Kyle York (Oracle Dyn)

When the internet is not bombarding your DNS with bogus requests, it’s trying to execute malicious SQL queries and crawling your site with bots (some good, some bad). We’re experiencing a perfect storm of volatility: application complexity meets a complex and evolving threat landscape with increasing attack vectors (shadow IT, the IoT, bots, ransomware, DDoS for hire, etc.) coupled with a terrifying lack of infrastructure resilience.

Kyle York explores the scale, complexity, and volatility of the internet and the risk it poses to your applications and infrastructure. He then introduces a new resource to help the good guys better understand these threats and take action.

This keynote is sponsored by Oracle Dyn.

good morning everyone thank you for

00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,910
having me so I'm Kyle York I thank you

00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,790
for the introduction so some of you

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,710
might remember me or if see me before as

00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,080
a member of the leadership team of Dean

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,570
that helps scaled on to the acquisition

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,489
by Oracle just about a year and a half

00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,720
ago so excited to be here today and

00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:25,329
introduce you to something that Oracle

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,939
is proud to announce and it really stems

00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:30,039
around the reliability in scale and

00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:32,649
security of your applications and your

00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,160
networks as you continue to operate in

00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:38,739
this really growing and complex internet

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,719
so what we're going to talk about at

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:43,149
first is is anyone been following

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,050
recently much of the activity that's

00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,370
going on in Syria as it relates to

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,230
internet availability so we started to

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,600
notice a trend don't worry I don't read

00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,989
Arabic either but what this is on the

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,050
right here is a it's actually the class

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:01,809
schedules for exams that's going on in

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,850
Syria today and what you're starting to

00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:06,160
notice through really interesting

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,960
datasets that there's a continued trend

00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,430
that's happening in Syria and we're

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,900
seeing this in many nation states where

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,660
internet access is actually being

00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,270
completely shut down for different

00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,100
purposes this purpose that we started to

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,500
notice a trend EIN was actually

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,750
nationwide national blackouts of the

00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,250
Internet in Syria in Syria across

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:29,440
multiple ISPs during exam time to ensure

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,180
no cheating is occurring on the internet

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,000
so you start to see a lot of these sort

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,220
of really different reasons for internet

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,140
volatility you tend to see a lot of

00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,390
action happening on the internet where

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,040
you don't know whose fault it is and you

00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,050
as network operators are struggling with

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,090
the performance and experience of your

00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,980
applications when really it's not your

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,360
fault and and we're here to tell you

00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,400
it's not your fault but you really need

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,380
tools in your hands to give you that

00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,970
meantime to innocence to make sure you

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,830
tell your boss and your executives and

00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,030
your board what's going on on today's

00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,950
global internet so we're here today to

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,440
talk a lot about that I think it's

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,540
undeniable that the Internet is his

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,019
rifled past commercially what it was

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,140
expected to be when original ARPANET was

00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:13,450
created the scale the Internet today 3.9

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,959
billion users as of this moment are

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,299
using the

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,000
most of that user growth is actually

00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,709
mobile and it's in many emerging markets

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,030
throughout the world so as you start to

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,549
think about your companies your

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,590
applications how you grow and reach a

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,859
global audience ensuring that you have

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,329
the visibility and management of your

00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:33,730
applications and the end users

00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,019
experience with them is critical as this

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,870
thing gets bigger and bigger and bigger

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:41,079
the complexity of the Internet is also

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,620
crazy complicated the internet routing

00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:46,120
pay tables the BGP is been doubling the

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,609
overall internet writing-table have been

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,349
doubling every decade over the last two

00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:52,569
and a half decades so as you can imagine

00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,669
who owns the Internet who runs the

00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:56,349
Internet who controls the fibre who who

00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:58,780
controls the undersea cables who

00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,310
controls the Internet is it state is it

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,620
public there's a lot of great working

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,000
bodies like ICANN and others and

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,739
internet architecture boards are trying

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,419
to figure out how to make sure we have

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,189
the right standards policies RFC's

00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,200
written to continue to deal with the

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,689
complexity of the Internet I know many

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,579
of you are bleeding edge web brands and

00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:17,889
focused on performance and security the

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,659
amount of objects that are now being

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:21,970
loaded on your pages from third-party

00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,979
widgets and micro services is creating

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,900
even further complexity that's hard for

00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,209
you and hard for your end users to

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,590
experience with and then lastly the

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,659
volatility and we're going to talk about

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,760
volatility on a bunch of different ways

00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:36,159
in a minute but you know really eyes

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,569
dying and now as Oracle we've been

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,519
monitoring the state of the internet for

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,989
the past 15 years we're shooting our

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,209
trace routes we're monitoring monitoring

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,889
DNS we're looking at the BGP routing

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,599
tables we're looking at recursive DNS

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,090
and we're looking at multi variant

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,680
lenses of the datasets with our data

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,909
science team incorporating a bunch of

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,519
machine learning to get smarter about

00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,919
how we do this to deliver back to you

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,629
value so that you can better optimize

00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,299
and manage your applications on the

00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:03,009
Internet we've been doing this as I said

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,750
for 15 years so we've basically been

00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,060
able to benchmark the state of the

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,609
internet over that time period and look

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,500
for anomalies or patterns and again

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:13,900
we're continuing to expose that in tools

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,449
and capability what you see on the right

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,919
side here is a bunch of this many of you

00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,269
might have followed the renesis research

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,370
blog a lot of this came from an

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,529
acquisition died that around us in 2014

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,570
that turned into the dying research blog

00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,520
that's now part of our Oracle internet

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,060
intelligence program and we're breaking

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,760
things that are

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,490
on the internet everyday Siri is not

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,770
alone in blocking internet for cheating

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,720
Iraq's been famous to do this Egypt as

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,430
well and you're seeing lots of different

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,850
you know kind of real-time rapid

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,770
response activity in context provided to

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,880
you through blog forum in in you know

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,790
we're really pushing that into more

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,220
resources for you as we progress I think

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,300
one thing I love the past talk you know

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,889
you see the stick figure which

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,060
represents the end user and then you see

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,160
the little cloud that represents the

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,540
network I think it's critical to for all

00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,580
of us to acknowledge that the Internet

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,160
is now becoming a part of our corporate

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,690
network at Oracle we obviously are are

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,880
feeling this big-time as more and more

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,800
databases and more and more of our

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,530
legacy data center in data center

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,810
on-premise workloads move to cloud the

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,000
reality is the Internet is your network

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,979
I saw a stat put out last week something

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,740
like eighty percent of you acknowledged

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:22,660
that you skip around your VPN throughout

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,520
your days maybe not you but definitely

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,100
salespeople and business people are

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,800
fretting around their VPNs consistently

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,630
and using the public Internet to access

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,720
business systems applications networks

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,919
every single day the volatility here

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,400
that you're seeing and this is I think

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,110
critical to see on the speak to the one

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,150
left this is actually Hurricane Maria in

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,770
real-time you actually noticed a spike

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,360
in traffic happening in the Caribbean

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,270
this is in the country of Puerto Rico

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,490
across there multi ISP links this is

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,110
basically people reaching out looking

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,539
for weather talking to loved ones and in

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,550
the internet shutting down and to this

00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,740
day full internet availability and

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,780
performance is still not back up and

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,610
running in Puerto Rico so thinking about

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,580
this when it comes to transit providers

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,930
to regional outages to networks to

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,180
thinking through how this affects your

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,130
application in real time we believe is

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,630
critical for you put one on the far

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,270
right is you know sometimes the Internet

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,970
is is used as a tool for DDoS for for

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,500
hires or you know BGP hijacks or transit

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,700
length and what's happening a lot is

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,250
you're actually seeing people get mad

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,050
right so the UK lotto a guy lost a bunch

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,090
of money what's he do a DDoS is the

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,770
website and takes it down for a day this

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,470
is the new world this is where we live

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,419
and we all need to be prepared so today

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,909
I'm here to introduce the internet

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,169
intelligence map this is our way of sort

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,490
of putting a bunch of tooling and

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,860
resources in the hands

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,870
the internet all internet constituents

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,729
to glean some of the same visibility and

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,470
access that we've been operating for the

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,660
past 15 years to build better networks

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,400
better sass apps better cloud solutions

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,889
and passing that along to our customers

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,080
but really wanted to provide a free

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,729
simple graphical treatment that I'd like

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,949
the play of video now and introduce you

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:03,639
to today over 3.9 billion people access

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,150
the Internet

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,699
we rely on it to unite us to empower our

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,580
businesses help us manage money and

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,169
foster global relationships it's a

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,240
system of ever-growing scale and

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,520
complexity but the very things that make

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,789
the internet so amazing also make it

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,930
increasingly vulnerable to volatility

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,669
securing your cloud and data in this

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,080
landscape requires a partner with more

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:32,650
data and more visibility introducing

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,599
Oracle's internet intelligence built on

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,880
years of research and analytics by dying

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,949
and backed by one of the world's most

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,500
comprehensive internet performance data

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,509
sets Oracle has developed the premier

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,759
resource in authority for reliable

00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,469
information on the Internet it has been

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,949
using those resources to tell the

00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:52,479
Internet story for more than a decade

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,310
some of this comprehensive data is being

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,930
democratized and shared with you in the

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,479
form of a newly launched Internet

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,729
intelligence map our resource designed

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,250
to offer enhanced updated insight into

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,110
the current state of the internet the

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:09,599
internet intelligence map allows you to

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:12,140
view global data on trace routes BGP and

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,430
DNS on a single dashboard

00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,500
[Music]

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,750
presenting three dimensions of Internet

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,550
connectivity side-by-side gives a unique

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,380
vantage point for monitoring Internet

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,010
traffic and the state of the global

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:30,550
Internet

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:33,099
[Music]

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,810
when issues with the internet arise the

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,669
map gives you the ability to investigate

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,700
the impact of internet connectivity

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:41,409
problems around the world the internet

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,479
intelligence map is just one of many

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:45,370
advanced awareness tools that help

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,230
Oracle improve your experience on the

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,529
cloud by making it better and more

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,770
reliable everyday Internet intelligence

00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:55,240
powered by Oracle cloud infrastructure

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,209
working to make the internet a safer

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,980
more stable experience for all who rely

00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:05,290
on so one thing I've realized in helping

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,000
build I'm from a scrappy startup out of

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,029
New Hampshire into the world's leader in

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,560
DNS in this data visibility is that the

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,810
infrastructure landscape is incredibly

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,149
volatile and complex and when we got

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,490
acquired by Oracle for me it was

00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,990
validation of the value we provided in

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,149
the infrastructure as a service

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,709
landscape but more so was a DoubleDown

00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,510
understanding that you know

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,510
infrastructure requires tremendous

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,829
resource and investment in scale so

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,170
we're proud to sort of bring that

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:35,050
scrappy hustle of a start-up in that

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,510
customer obsession around Internet

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,579
performance and internet security of

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,560
dying and and launch that today as part

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,750
of Oracle cloud infrastructure this is a

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,339
graphical representation you'll see here

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,130
of the same story I told you earlier

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,290
about Syria blocking internet access and

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,630
you literally all I know many of you are

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,890
probably modern-day gamers but all I

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,709
know is you don't want to be playing the

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,329
game avatar and on Atari pitfall as

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,160
you're running your networks and if you

00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,570
look at Syria this is a graphical

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
representation of the internet going

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,420
down consistently

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,880
for three hours every day for the last

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,829
two weeks follow along and earn an Intel

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
that Oracle comm please talk to us at

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,279

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,360
program came from Akamai wrote the state

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,740
of the internet report he's here please

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,300
search out our team and thank you very

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,410
