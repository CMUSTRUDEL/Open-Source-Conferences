hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,670
velocity and San Jose I'm here with Kyle

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,560
from oracle dine Kyle how you doing hi

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,570
good to see you thank you good so last

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,120
time we talked I think you were dying

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,410
yeah and now your Oracle dies yeah can

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,870
you talk a little bit about what that

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,119
means and what what it means to dying

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,220
yeah absolutely so we were acquired by

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,800
Oracle's cloud infrastructure team a

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:28,590
sauron's group and so we've sort of our

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,000
R&D groups have become part of Oracle's

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,610
cloud infrastructure team focused on the

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,649
cloud edge and cottage services so the

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,210
DNS the traffic management we also

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,219
acquired a business called Zen edge a

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,559
few months ago those web application

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,750
security to firewall DDoS protection

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,969
about protection so we're really

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,920
rounding out the portfolio of cloud edge

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,170
services as part of the Oracle client

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,449
for structure platform and you know a

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,090
bunch of my function has been to that VP

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,469
a product strategy for that group trying

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,350
to figure out how to continue to

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,969
accelerate roadmap and evangelize our

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,879
differentiation innovations in the

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,159
market it's been it's been a fun ride so

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,860
switch it up so what does this mean for

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,750
Oracle's customers like you know I look

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,250
at Oracle and I think of working with

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,430
large enterprise that's you know and

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,340
typically databases and financials stuff

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,439
for enterprises so what do you guys

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,729
bring to that offering yes so when we

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,470
were originally acquired I think it was

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,930
a lot for the competency around internet

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,700
performance visibility better traffic

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,350
management as more workloads we're

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,329
moving from on-premise data centers

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,700
captive data centers to the cloud and

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,100
every single one of Oracle's customers

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,950
trying to figure out that transition and

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,430
I think the beauty of the sort of Oracle

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,920
customer base is you know I think it's

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,090
the enterprise is still figuring out how

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,799
to move to the cloud how do you

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,450
transform how to transform yep and you

00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,520
know we think it's somewhere around 10

00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,080
percent of enterprise workloads business

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,470
application the systems that run your

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,909
company those are the only ones that we

00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,310
also see it as a very hybrid cloud

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,350
environment so how do you do this and in

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,229
this new world and ensure security and

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,790
compliance performance when it's no

00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,250
longer in your data center and your

00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,620
transit relationships and that's the

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,989
cloud right so we're kind of coming in

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,150
and helping provide that visibility that

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,890
lense of the public internet as well as

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,080
giving more controls and security

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,120
features to make the transition

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,860
hopefully easier so you kind of give the

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,540
vision in there for people to understand

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,250
why it's important but you also help

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,989
with some of the protection yeah

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,819
absolutely so if you think about data

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,950
and you think about the database and you

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,780
think about the things that Oracle is

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,830
obviously famous for as it relates to

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,200
ERP and HR cloud I mean these services

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,030
are mission-critical data sets and are

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,350
incredibly important to the health and

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:49,060
well-being of enterprise businesses so

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,760
ensuring that you have visibility and

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,920
security to protect their services as

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,660
they hopefully move to the club and also

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,370
probably remain hybrid and different

00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,410
components and as that sequencing

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,630
strategy of what things move first a

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,670
cloud happened that's something that we

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,320
are helping with all the way up to stock

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,750
all the way up to applications even

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,180
though it's an infrastructure service

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,120
mechanism it's really about moving to

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,410
cloud holistic Lea across the board so

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,150
you could be very interesting keynote

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,100
today can you talk a little bit about

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,530
what it was I mean the Intel report

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,100
sounds fascinating yeah so we launched

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,260
the internet intelligence map which is a

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,410
free resource for the market based on

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,239
about 15 years of internet traffic data

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,380
that we've been collecting on the

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,140
performance and availability

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,680
of the global Internet provider agnostic

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,900
right so we've been using these services

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,290
first and dying and then now an Oracle

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,570
to really drive a third party visibility

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,460
of how the internet works and you know

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,960
these disruptions are affecting you know

00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,210
the enterprise because the Internet's

00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,650
becoming a big part of your network so

00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,180
that's kind of the connection in the

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,100
correlation and we think it's great

00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,930
differentiation for Oracle cloud because

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,790
you know we're not a consumer apps

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,170
company you know we don't run any

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,360
commerce website we're straight

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,370
enterprise technology so our ability to

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,510
sort of democratize these data sets put

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,050
them in the hands of our enterprise

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,120
customers to modernize their their

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,250
workloads into the cloud give us a nice

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,700
compelling advantage and is that map

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,070
updated regularly yeah yeah it's near

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,730
real-time we're collecting every 24

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,250
seconds we're running about 500 million

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,770
choice routes across the internet and

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,870
collecting data on the performance of

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,240
the Internet and we're doing about I

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,790
think it's about 220 billion points of

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,130
data collection per day that we are

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,740
bringing together both of multiple very

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,080
events ooh border gateway protocol trace

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,520
data authoritative from recursive DNS

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,160
data we think we've got the world's best

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,960
map of IP addresses where they are who

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,490
owns them who runs those portions of the

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,100
internet again we're just bringing that

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,350
out to the market in this kind of a

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,990
reference case as well because you guys

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,910
are doing this on your own technologies

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,860
yeah and again is dying we did this for

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,550
our DNS networks and for our load

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,050
balancing services imagine that now

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,180
rolling into an overall client

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,620
infrastructure platform it helps you you

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,660
know decide where to deploy

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,420
infrastructure or what regions to use

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,430
what services to move over but also

00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,400
bring that all the way up the stack for

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,010
Oracle who again is is moving from

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,930
licensed software of these you know

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,100
fusion apps and e-business suite all

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,290
these services in but from e-business

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,540
with the fusion ops and then you know

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,610
the acquisition of NetSuite and many

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,070
others in the Oracle data cloud mo

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,840
blue Kai and data logics are really kind

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,640
of reinventing Oracle

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,699
yeah but famous for what it's famous for

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,430
and not losing those roots but

00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:50,020
yeah how do you kind of bring that story

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,860
forward for the next 40 years of Larry

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,379
Ellison's life

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,169
so in your journey with Oracle your your

00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,669
brief was it said 12 months about 18 18

00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,099
months what has been the biggest

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,900
surprise for you I think the biggest

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,060
surprise I mean I've historically

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,240
personally been a startup guy you know

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:11,319
scaling dying from 15 engineers got sold

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,509
when your get acquired you don't really

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,550
know what it's going to be like and you

00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:18,099
know I think Oracle's done about 130

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,389
acquisitions over the last 12 years so I

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,580
think I'm pretty good at and they've

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,840
learned a lot from the past I think what

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,889
I've been most surprised at is we were

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,229
acquired by the Oracle cloud

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,210
infrastructure team in Seattle and I've

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,500
found that they've actually given us a

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,090
tremendous amount of rope to be

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,310
entrepreneurial and to continue to

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,409
innovate aggressively and it's kind of a

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,599
I guess it's an advantage to be a second

00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:38,800
mover and infrastructure-as-a-service

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,839
try to play catch-up to some of the

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,389
other big guys out there that we're

00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,629
really able to innovate to differentiate

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,789
and operate like a start-up in worlds I

00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,210
think it's the 17th most valued brand in

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:52,900
the world

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,759
so having that sort of brand you know

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,889
and resources behind we're building and

00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,110
infrastructure for the enterprise but

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,169
also still being able to operate in a

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,430
kind of startup mentality has been

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,169
refreshing and I don't think I don't

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,839
think many of us had I nor Xen edge was

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,039
acquired after necessarily knew what the

00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,270
future would hold that's been pretty

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,699
good so far and are you still in New

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,770
Hampshire yeah in that that too that's

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,169
been great they we actually you said

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,939
you're down in mass we just actually

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,370
replaced with this massive sign in the

00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,930
register New Hampshire mill yard and it

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,550
was a dine sign and we just replaced it

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,810
with a massive read Oracle sign that

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,060
lights up at night and change the

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,020
skyline of my hometown and and you know

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,120
our hope is that that's a cloud you know

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,009
employment hub for the next you know a

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,180
couple decades up in New Hampshire and

00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,460
that's it that's really exciting

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,199
so you just looked back for us on under

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,060
acquisition how it's gone can you now

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,490
look forward and what would you like to

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,699
see happen in the next 12 months yeah I

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,949
think for us like I said our R&D

00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,330
functions are really focusing on

00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,880
continuing to evolve Oracle cloud

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,160
infrastructure platform

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,620
a lot of our product strategy functions

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,420
and dota market functions are really

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,610
working with companies that are more

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,860
climbed native-born in the cloud it's

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,570
really the velocity show is founding

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,520
right what performance security global

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,260
scale internet scale and the

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,780
complexities that go with that so I

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,790
think as important as it is for us to

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,070
solve the Oracle database in Oracle

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,260
on-premise technologies and software

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,000
moving to our cloud but I really like

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,340
the CS do is accelerate that sort of

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,940
DevOps you know bottoms up you know

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,010
cloud native global scale those use

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,810
cases kind of finding Oracle giving

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,930
Oracle a try seeing our price

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,940
performance improvements and see the the

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,410
traction in the market that way I think

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,669
I'll be that would be that would be a

00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,500
big win for all of us at Oracle

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,430
excellent well Kyle we look forward to

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,430
that journey all right thank you

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,770
