Description: 
	Netra Q&A: Scaling resource-intensive APIs (sponsored by Oracle Dyn)
Kyle York (Oracle Dyn), Richard Lee (Netra)

Kyle York and Richard Lee explore Netra’s high-performance computing environment, focusing on how the company’s AI and deep learning models process tens of millions of images and videos each day in a time- and cost-effective manner. Along the way, they explain what worked, what didn’t, and why you need an Agile, hybrid infrastructure if you want to build an AI business at the scale of social.

This keynote is sponsored by Oracle Dyn.
