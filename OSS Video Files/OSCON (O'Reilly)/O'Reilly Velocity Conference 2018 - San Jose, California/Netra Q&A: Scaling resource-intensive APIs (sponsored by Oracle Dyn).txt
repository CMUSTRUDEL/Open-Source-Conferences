good to see everyone again so yesterday

00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,800
I was up here um Kyle York VP of product

00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,769
strategy for Oracle cloud infrastructure

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,999
I'm also the GM of Oracle Dyne and we

00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:15,249
were up there yesterday announcing the

00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:17,650
launch of our internet intelligence map

00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,370
check it out at Internet Intel Oracle

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,560
com

00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,600
it's a free resource simple graphical

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,470
representation of the state of the

00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,550
global internet carriers nation level

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,950
internet connectivity

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,500
check it out hopefully it provides a

00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,020
little bit of value to you as you manage

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,489
your high scale internet scale web

00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:41,770
assets so we're excited today to be up

00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:44,230
here with Richard Lee founder and CEO of

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,910
netra gonna let him introduce himself in

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,980
a little bit but one thing that's really

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,950
exciting about what Netra is doing in

00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,210
leveraging sort of a multi cloud

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,430
opportunity is we're doing they're doing

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,640
something that wasn't possible ten years

00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,590
ago with ten year old compute power and

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,350
automation and management power or

00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,309
capability for infrastructure so I think

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,470
when you start to hear about what he's

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:07,090
doing it really is a sign of I think

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,770
things to come the types of innovations

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,100
that will be happening on our global

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,860
Internet and how we can continue to use

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,590
new tooling and new providers and new

00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,600
spaces to be successful in executing our

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,220
day to day jobs so Richard thanks for

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,110
being here with us thanks Kyle hi

00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,430
everyone as Kyle said my name is Richard

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,130
Lee I'm the CEO of a company called

00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,920
Netra our mission is to help enterprise

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,180
make sense of the tsunami of imagery so

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,700
we're a Boston based startup

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,799
we're seed funded we have about 10

00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,710
people so not your typical Oracle

00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,260
customer and actually we compete with

00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,990
the likes of Google cloud vision Amazon

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,670
recognition Microsoft Azure so despite

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,900
our size we often go up against some of

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,670
the biggest players out there and a lot

00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,810
of that is enabled by the current cloud

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,340
infrastructure out there so we're going

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,020
to talk about a little bit about our

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,960
company on our technology and then how

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,820
we're trying to scale with digital we

00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,350
provide image recognition as a service

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,920
to our customers and we deliver that via

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,270
an API that API really gives access to

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,270
our deep learning models that are

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,250
trained up on over 7500 classifiers

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,099
today so this is a little bit more

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,980
complex than hot dog or not hot dog if

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,450
you will so

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,580
if you think about it we're really

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,370
trying to do is pattern match around a

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,470
cluster of pixels if you will in a photo

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,970
and we're trying to determine it detect

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,610
objects of interest and so for example

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,500
or humans model may detect the face

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,750
there and then send it to our humans

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,390
daemon and then classify age gender and

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,819
ethnicity and so in this case we found a

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,090
female face most likely 20s and a

00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:42,819
Caucasian likewise our brands model

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,680
looks for the presence of a logo or not

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,540
a logo in this case we detect the

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,069
presence of the adidas logo which even

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,720
though it's tiny and really kind of

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,420
obscure and hard to see on our headband

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,410
we detect it localize it and are able to

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,090
determine with hundred percent

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,900
confidence that adidas is present and

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,239
then lastly our context and object model

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,069
detects and classifies what else is in

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,880
the image so we detect the tennis player

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:09,760
in athlete sports a person or tennis the

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,709
sport itself so what what's really

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,380
amazing is that we do all of this in

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,030
about 200 milliseconds so that includes

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,890
download of the download of the image

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,720
decoding of the image or extracting of

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,380
the frames and then hitting each of the

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,239
demons and so it's mind-boggling how how

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,220
much computational power is involved in

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,109
doing it this type of thing and so while

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,180
it's challenging on a on a one image

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,250
basis really trying to scale it for it

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,930
for for digital is what we're going

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,310
after next and and that's probably what

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,549
this group is most interested in

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,920
learning so really if you think about

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,810
the the the three trillion or so images

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,340
that consumers are taking and sharing on

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,389
their mobile phones almost every single

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,130
day or the 300 hours 300 hours of video

00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:53,160
uploaded to YouTube every minute of

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,989
every day this is all unstructured

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,060
unstructured imagery right now so Natura

00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,500
adds structure to this and and really

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,569
when we're trying to design our system

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,579
on the dev side it's how are we gonna

00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,200
scale our business to be able to to

00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:07,840
process millions and billions and even

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,849
trillions of images a day and so the

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,440
heart of our system today is built off

00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:15,609
of Apache Kafka and so we use Apache to

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,060
essentially be our messaging broker and

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:21,940
what we found is it's extremely scalable

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,280
as well as highly reliant we're able to

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,180
process hundreds of millions of images a

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,870
day and then use it to kind of transfer

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,620
it to each of our diff

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,440
Damon's so we've also docker eyes our

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,940
algorithms such that we can deploy on

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,980
any sort of platform whether it's

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,320
vertically on any of the cloud platforms

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,780
or horizontally across or even on our

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,930
own dev box so we have a pretty complex

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,640
hybrid infrastructure right now that has

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,400
really come about through quite a bit of

00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,750
trial and error and and so we've over

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,640
the past couple of years we've deployed

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,560
on basically every cloud platform out

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,270
there starting on AWS two years ago and

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
we used to train our models actually on

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,090
our own GPU laptops AWS had very limited

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,500
GPUs even two or three years ago so at

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,800
that point we had had invested in our

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,000
own dev boxes since that time obviously

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,220
a lot more players have come into the

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,050
field including Oracle and so we've now

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,270
kind of looking into being more flexible

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,330
and hybrid or agile across these cloud

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,010
platforms what we're doing today is is

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,370
really not no longer investing in our

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,800
own boxes but more kind of focusing on

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,450
really scalable volume across bare metal

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,610
GPUs so we actually are deploying an

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,010
Oracle cloud infrastructure we're using

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,720
their P 100 right now and in our tests

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,000
again some of the biggest players one of

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,170
the players I mentioned the the the

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,850
results were astounding and we're

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,270
focused on price performance right now

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,760
so we're able to get 62% lower cost at

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,040
30% higher throughput on our volume and

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,300
and again with our customers today we've

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,960
we've over the past couple of months

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,970
have scaled beyond the typical smaller

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,890
to medium sized customers to large

00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,050
enterprise right now and so with that

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,480
comes much higher volume much higher SLA

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,390
is much higher quality and reliability

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,610
and so we're focused on using kind of

00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,350
bare metal today for consistent volume

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,010
so tens of millions of images a day and

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:15,070
then using VMs to really adjust for

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,450
scalability dynamically so if we get hit

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,770
with a couple million images as we did

00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,100
last week that was a bit of a surprise

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,900
we were able to spin up a new instance

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,100
almost within minutes to be able to work

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,810
the queue down and once the queue gets

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,310
below a certain threshold we were able

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,460
to spin that down to manage our costs

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,990
but but our experience so far on Oracle

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,250
OCI has been has been pretty amazing

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,700
from from a price performance

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:40,090
perspective so that's kind of it from

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,380
from my presentation so yeah so I mean I

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,700
think for many of you just to kind of

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,080
quick introduction I mean when we

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,750
he set out to build Oracle cloud

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,900
infrastructure right out of the gate it

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,930
was very specific to purpose-built cloud

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,460
bare-metal cloud to be able to tell

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,900
customers or enable customers to

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,600
shutdown data centers and move their

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:03,400
database or move their license software

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,230
and ERP or HCM over to Oracle cloud I

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,270
think one of the the side benefits of

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,730
being a definitely a second or late

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,320
mover advantage is to be able to take

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,520
the best talent possible we were

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,590
actually building our organization

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,510
predominantly in Seattle making

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,360
tremendous acquisitions I should say so

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,550
for dine and Zen edge and others and

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,320
being able to kind of find these unique

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,720
use cases here obviously in

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,520
high-performance computing that are

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,740
attracting sort of sub segments of what

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,110
I would call more cloud native born in

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,010
the cloud type companies who I don't

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,750
think many of you in the room are

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,150
thinking about or excited about opening

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,410
up your next datacenter unnecessarily or

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,870
trying to figure out how to how to

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,700
leverage cloud to to scale your scale

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,010
your businesses and hopefully become the

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,560
next you know fortune 100 company in the

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,080
next decade or two yeah so so talk about

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,580
a little you know you're also part of

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
the Oracle cloud startup accelerator

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,620
program you know at first when I came

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,470
into Oracle I was a little bit like

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,970
reluctant to believe that Oracle was

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,860
actually having a startup program you

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,480
know and what it what it meant talk

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,180
about like the value drivers that you've

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,400
seen out of that just a little bit here

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,750
and let me let me say preface us by it's

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,370
it's still relatively new we were

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,260
accepted into the scale-up accelerator

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,940
and I will also say we were part of one

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,460
of the more kind of more traditional

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,620
accelerators that that that went out I

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,330
think what was attractive to us to

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,520
participate with Oracle were a couple

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,930
fold one credits are obviously valuable

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,870
to any startup it's like free venture

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,840
capital to either give more than I've

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,270
heard yeah it could always give but

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,349
secondly you know access to Oracle's

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,150
customers right you guys have four

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,280
hundred twenty thousand customers we're

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,870
starting to go a little bit more

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,940
upmarket Enterprise with our customer

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,800
base so getting access to your customer

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,600
base was extremely interactive in 3 it

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,640
was it was non diluted so I would

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,020
recommend any startup that is kind of

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,850
building its own cloud native

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,740
application to kind of look at it it's

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,630
been it's been a great program for us we

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,440
get some exposure opportunities to go

00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,690
market

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,580
yet really kind of the first look at the

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,260
latest you know we're excited about you

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,910
know some of the future things that

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,280
we've heard are coming down the road map

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,860
for Oracle and in in on both like vm's

00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,120
and v-102 etc and that's where we're

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,190
kind of building we're transitioning a

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,990
lot of our infrastructure to tensorflow

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,780
to take advantage of a lot of these

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,060
processes that are optimized around GPUs

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,840
so talk a little bit about your

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,640
obviously a very kind DNS customer of

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,320
ours and we've obviously specialized in

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,800
that is done and now Oracle for four

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,900
years yeah talk about you know DNS and

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,270
performance around DNS and sort of how

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,010
that is managing this multi cloud you

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,730
know environment for you yeah I mean we

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,380
definitely we've used dine at Hostgator

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,930
really to host our our website and then

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,150
and really that that's kind of been like

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,780
the the primary focus for us on the

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,550
nside but you know we are working in a

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,820
lot of different areas with with Oracle

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,260
in in both on the the cloud side the

00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,880
data cloud side and the social side as

00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,100
well right well thank you very much

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,020
