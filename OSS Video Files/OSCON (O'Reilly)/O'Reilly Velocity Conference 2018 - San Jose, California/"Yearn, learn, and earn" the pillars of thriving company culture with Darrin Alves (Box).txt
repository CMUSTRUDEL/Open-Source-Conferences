hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,069
velocity 2018 in San Jose I'm here with

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,450
Darren from box Darren how you doing

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,950
great how are you good

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,780
so what do you do at box so I'm the

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,360
senior vice president of technology

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,130
operations so I run everything from our

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,020
data centers and public clouds out to

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,029
our network operations center and

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,420
everything in between can you unpack the

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,090
box

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,000
what is max so box is a cloud content

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,760
management platform it allows companies

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,220
to do things as simple as enterprise

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,650
file sync and share but we do it in a

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,469
more secure level government DoD level

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,210
impact four levels compliance but we

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,370
also platforms that allow developers to

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,770
build applications on that so that we

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,100
can take some of that security the

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,690
complexity out of it for teams and and

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,039
allow that to work off-site for

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,390
companies but still provide them

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,860
security that they wouldn't be able to

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,460
provide on-site are you more of an

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:57,000
enterprise or a consumer we yeah we have

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,010
about 70% of the enterprise fortune 500

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,260
under agreement as box users so we're

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,960
largely square in the enterprise space

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,200
okay so I heard you you coined a term it

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,110
box called yearn learn and earned yes

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,090
yeah really that was around you know and

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,979
one of the beliefs that I have is that

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,530
those are the three pillars that either

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:20,520
attract talent or keep talent at any

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,320
company on the uran side what we've what

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,460
I feel is that people want to work for

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,350
the company I think we've had a

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,540
conversation offline around some company

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,060
that's doing something that matters it

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,290
has the culture the level of respect

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,869
those type of things you have to feel

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,420
good about the company that you work for

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:38,880
on the learn side people want to have

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,009
the ability to learn new technologies

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,079
they won't have opportunities at box we

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,259
use everything from containerization to

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,180
OpenStack to public cloud providers to

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,200
high security certifications and

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,420
compliances and then also mobility 30%

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,850
of employees of paka our positions are

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,950
filled to internal mobility as well so

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,869
and the last one is earned people want

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,719
to feel that they're fairly compensated

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,030
and at market levels or if the company

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,950
succeeds that they'll have some benefit

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,869
of their own in the success that's

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,450
aligned with the company so it's really

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,380
there's no one for different people they

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,090
may be different love

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,490
of importance but ideally those are the

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,260
three things that if you can solve for

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,550
folks I think he either keeps them in

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,750
their job or will attract them and I

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,880
think we've done a good job of it and

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,130
that's kind of building a culture yes

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,400
you know those those three together kind

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,920
of help build a culture that fosters

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,020
long-term employees yes and and you know

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,300
as you know the valley is can sometimes

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,080
be very transient and and employment so

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,030
creating that that cultural brand

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,500
allowing people to have that mobility to

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,600
it whether they're early in their career

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,090
or later in their careers are all things

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,250
that I think help you know solidify that

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,380
so employees you're in the valley yes

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,230
and there's a lot of competition for

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,120
great talent right so when you see

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,010
someone that you want what what is that

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,660
like some of the first questions you ask

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,230
them when they're sitting in front of

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,670
you looking to work for box what what

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,600
are some of the things you want to know

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,920
about them so for me one of the largest

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,960
motivations having been in the

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,590
technology business for some time in

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,050
hyperscale companies for for a while now

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,730
whole and say how long but it's around

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,330
people who are hobbyists I used the term

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,520
hobbyist you know I was working on

00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,990
computers before I ever had any formal

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,300
education or training around them

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,710
because I was passionate about it so I I

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,390
look for that person that if they were

00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,640
no matter what job they were doing

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,170
previously if they went home they would

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,400
they would work on a computer do this

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,260
those are the people I think have the

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,390
passion that continue to want to work so

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,700
first and foremost that's one of the

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,770
things we look at but also where do they

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,600
what kind of mark do they want to leave

00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,390
on the industry and what passion do they

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,360
have for learning etc so more than just

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,980
it's a job they actually wants a career

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,240
it's a career not a job I think there's

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,150
a difference between having a job and

00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,590
having a career and we're less

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,209
interested in people who want to have a

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,490
job and much more interested in people

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,990
who want to develop a career so if you

00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,260
if you look at all the companies that

00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:13,770
you compete with why does box stand out

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,650
I actually believe that the culture is

00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,479
one

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,259
you know I talked about those three

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,270
pillars probably the one that is the the

00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,250
two that I would say are the largest

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,930
impactful most impactful things that we

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,120
do is the mobility within the

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,580
organization and having a goal at the

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,770
corporate level to have mobility I think

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,180
that attracts a lot of talent I think

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,669
the other piece is when we talk about

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,560
culture there's nothing that the box

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:40,660
employee wants for we they get lunch

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,630
dinner everything that you always pay

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,100
for trains they're their transportation

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,990
to the office all of the things are

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,490
covered so we really take all of those

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,320
things out of the equation so people can

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,410
really focus on their career on their

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,419
work yeah that's excellent so what is

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,389
the biggest challenge to keep people

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,490
from leaving box is because if you have

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:03,039
this great culture and you have a

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,310
product that is needed by enterprises

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,110
why would people ever leave it sit well

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,460
there's this is a there's a lot of

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,770
companies here in the valley and there's

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,720
new ones that pop up all the time

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,370
but I think the balance that we always

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,530
have to strike at box that's difficult

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,770
is we have to meet customers needs and

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,539
their demands and the appetite for the

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,250
technologies that we people want to use

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:27,039
and work in so it's a constant balance

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,930
of meeting market demands as well as

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,970
employee demands and if you

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,490
overcompensate on any two of those

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,560
things then you can find yourself having

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,120
trouble retaining talent and that kind

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,039
of hovers around the whole learn idea

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,590
right exactly new technologies they want

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,090
to use you get to learn yet how did

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,190
deploy that for them yeah so it's really

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,099
balancing those three pride those three

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,870
pillars and but also you know we you

00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,130
know there's there's three people I say

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,820
that you try to solve for it's the

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,130
customers employees and shareholders and

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,630
in that in that order and that's the

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,729
balancing act that we always have to try

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,789
to maintain excellent so if you looked

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,470
forward 12 months from now would you say

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,570
the culture at Vox is going to be the

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,900
same are you gonna be able to keep it

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,060
the same and still grow and still scale

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,210
and still meet new customers demands I I

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:19,180
hope so so our our CEO and and some of

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,340
our other founders that's one of the

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,889
things that I think is curated the most

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,330
at box within so even our CEOs are still

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,460
heavily involved in the culture if you

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,830
look at the feedback that we get on the

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,470
culture

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,930
everyone is extremely focused on

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,010
maintaining that cultural aspect that we

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,750
have because I do think it is a

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,790
differentiator that we have in the work

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,940
in the workplace when you say look at

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:45,190
our our reviews or culture are you

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,960
talking about the website that people

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,190
when they leave a company put reviews on

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,700
yes yeah yeah yeah score extremely well

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,910
in those even when we look at people who

00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,530
have left we we go deeply into why would

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,970
they leave and those types of things and

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,460
then when we where there's a chance to

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,710
do correction we do we employ everything

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,420
from pulse surveys to others to

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,850
constantly re-evaluate and take a pulse

00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,820
of the culture constantly so my last

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,300
question for you is if you could tell

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,310
every tech leader out there one piece of

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,740
advice on how to create a culture like

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,040
this what what what is the best way to

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,010
get culture like this going one thing

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,510
that's very difficult is for me it's

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,890
it's difficult to say one thing because

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,750
I think you have to it's a it's an

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,910
ecosystem that has to be firing on

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,030
multiple cylinders and if you only if

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,070
you only target one area then yes you

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,720
might solve for some people but you may

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,280
not solve for others and you have to

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,730
have that whole ecosystem I think in

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,170
place so but I think culture would be

00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,600
ideally the first and foremost thing to

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,370
solve for and then and then probably the

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,540
learning side and the mobility people

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,550
have to feel good about what they're

00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,530
doing and who they work for and who they

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,060
work with and if they don't feel that

00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,750
way they're not going to last long

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,520
anywhere

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,710

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,710
