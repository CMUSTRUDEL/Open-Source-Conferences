hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,339
velocity 2018 in San Jose

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,600
I'm here with Angela from sales for

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,410
essentially how you doing good how are

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,090
you good

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,790
how's the event been for you so far it's

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,110
been great yeah meeting a lot of people

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,030
sessions are great too and so what do

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,010
you do at Salesforce I work as a

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,619
performance engineer with the sales

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,660
cloud team and essentially I've been

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,449
working in productivity for a long time

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,970
yeah ok so you guys probably at

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,310
Salesforce have a lot of different

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,610
technology stacks technologies

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,680
themselves platforms because you've been

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,120
through a few acquisitions yep fairly

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,070
recently now how do you bring all that

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,050
together in if you're performance

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,610
engineer hmm how do you still remain

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,160
performant with all those different

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,020
things coming together yeah it's it's

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,430
quite challenging because there is a lot

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,390
of subsystems that are at play

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,760
especially with acquisitions coming into

00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,309
Salesforce so what we have in Salesforce

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,129
we have what we call a v2 mom and that's

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,550
essentially a document that consists of

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:05,939
our vision values methods obstacles and

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,380
metrics and each employee is encouraged

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,900
to write their own be to mom it's sort

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,270
of like your own professional mission

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,920
statement for the year and so we

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,270
encourage all of the people who come in

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,490
through our acquisitions to write their

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,310
own v2 mom and add performance as a

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,740
metric so that that way we can keep a

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,080
line to a common goal and ensure that

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,360
all of our subsystems also have that

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,150
same common goal so that's that's

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,490
essentially how we do it excellent so do

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,259
you see all the different stacks as a

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,090
challenge or an advantage it's more of

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,119
an opportunity honestly to see all of

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,750
these subsystems come together and give

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,210
us a lot more capability than we had

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,740
before so it's it's actually really

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,509
really good for us so some of the

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,280
acquisitions bring technologies that are

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,350
going to be good for Salesforce hmm and

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,820
then some just have to go along their

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,079
way and move on um I don't know how much

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,360
we've I guess

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,520
grandfathered into our own product and

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,160
how much has been sort of left behind

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,590
but we try to make sure that every part

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,530
of every acquisition is considered and

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,010
as part of the Salesforce family so when

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,250
you have

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,599
so many third-party apps built into your

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,900
platform mm-hmm

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,760
how do you as a performance engineer

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,129
still make sure your high performance

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,349
could those apps slow you down and oh

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,629
yeah down the system and how do you make

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:35,940
sure that doesn't happen we try to

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:38,510
ensure that we using as much of our

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,790
homeroom tools to measure performance

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,480
around all of these new new features

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,269
that we're building

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,030
we actually have proprietary frameworks

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,709
that we use like aura for example and so

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,950
we build performance tools around them

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,930
one of those tools is called Soleil and

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,239
it essentially measures a bunch of

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,849
different metrics and these are the

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,230
metrics that are added to our v2 mom

00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,209
this is this is essentially what the

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,349
common goal of all of our acquisitions

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:10,650
as well as what our Salesforce core

00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:13,709
pages alright so yeah essentially it's

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,590
around building our own homegrown tools

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,540
and as well as using open source tools

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,010
so how do you evaluate whether you're

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,139
gonna use a homegrown or you're gonna go

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,449
to a third-party that's a great question

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:27,900
we actually have a lot of we do a lot of

00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:30,299
research and essentially it it just

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,269
depends on what advantages work out for

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,579
us in terms of homegrown tools we

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:38,449
definitely feel like we since we build a

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:41,069
lot of proprietary frameworks we tend to

00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:42,720
build tools that are very specific you

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,970
know that it can do a very specific

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,609
thing that can be customized exactly the

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,129
way that we want which you can't get

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,290
with third-party tools sometimes and

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,090
there's also this question of cost how

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,150
expensive is it going to be for us to

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,620
build our own tool versus buy a license

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,370
from a third-party vendor

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,129
so it's it depends is like the simple

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,079
answer but there's a lot of factors you

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,530
guys also use open source tools we do

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,269
interview back yes yeah we have a big

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,540
open source community within Salesforce

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,030
and we try to come you know give back to

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,789
our open source fellows as much as

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,909
possible so yeah so as a performance

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,310
engineer at Salesforce what is your your

00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,320
biggest

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,320
Challenge that keeps you awake at night

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,630
oh man this is this isn't like an

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,950
interesting question because you know

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,139
I'd say of course as I mentioned there's

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,450
like so many subsystems at play there's

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,130
like the data-based here there's the

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,919
middle tier with all the integrations

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,889
happening and the front-end performance

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,010
as well so I've mainly focused on the

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,710
front-end side of things and there's a

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,440
rapid growth of technology happening of

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,090
web technology and I think the main

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,639
challenge for us is to figure out how do

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,340
we get all of the performance

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,160
improvements that that each of these web

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,660
technologies is bringing but also ensure

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,380
that our customers are not impacted

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,600
adversely so I think that's the biggest

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,370
challenge for me and they're still

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,820
secure there's still they're still

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,650
secure we're still giving our customers

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,260
you know as much flexibility in terms of

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:24,410
customization and scaling exactly

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,610
20-round times everything exactly yep

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,440
that's a big challenge for you guys

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,770
mm-hmm so if you were to look forward

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,930
and look at the next cuz I know a

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,180
year.maybe is too long but next six

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,320
months and Salesforce what do you want

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,690
to see you guys doing better

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,610
honestly we want to make sure that and

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,320
we have this goal on our Vito mom as

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,190
well we want to make sure that every

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,470
customer that gets added to our

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,919
ecosystem it gets the best performance

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,350
the best experience in terms of their

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,289
front end in terms of their interaction

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,360
with the platform and just ensure that

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,660
our customers who've been with us for a

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,639
really long time are not impacted by

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,550
addition of new customers right so is

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:17,900
performance in your world never do to

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:22,820
the customer having old oh how do you

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,169
mitigate that we try to advise customers

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,450
as much as possible to upgrade

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:29,030
especially browsers and things that can

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,510
easily be upgraded you know we try to

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,490
get them to move up as much as possible

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,169
but with like old systems like all

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,810
laptops that have been in play for like

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,389
ten years you can't do much

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,850
we write a lot of best practices

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,800
documents for for developers who develop

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,230
on our platform and we tell them you

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,810
need to be aware of a ten year old

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,540
laptop not performing as well as a new

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,520
one so here's the best best practice guy

00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,270
and hopefully they follow it excellent

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,070
excellent

00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,510
well we certainly look forward to

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,190
watching what you guys do in this area

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,090
so thank you so much thank you so much

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,090
it's great being here

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,069
