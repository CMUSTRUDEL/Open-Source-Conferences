hi this is Mike Erickson from velocity

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,100
2018 in San Jose

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,420
I'm here with Martin from Microsoft

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,950
Martin how're you doing I'm doing very

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,370
well nice to be back nice to see you you

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,800
too

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,690
so we talked last year and that time I

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,610
asked you going forward what would you

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,830
like to see happen and you said you'd

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,520
like to see Microsoft get even better at

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,250
doing open source yeah Wow have you

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,279
gotten better at open source I hope so

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,980
so yeah that's fascinating we've been

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,410
doing a lot more open source projects

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,690
the Microsoft organization on github is

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,780
now the biggest of the big company

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,260
organizations darknets now I'm an open

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,350
source you know and a lot more engineers

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,480
in Microsoft a day in day out working on

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,309
open source projects where's that coming

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,920
from is that coming from the top I mean

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,340
is it yeah everyone like thinks open

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,170
source now it was one of those bottom-up

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,469
top-down meet moments the individual

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,449
engineers sort of the grassroots level

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,790
you know knowing how to build software

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,670
and wanting to contribute back and then

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:13,350
top-down understanding the open source

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,229
software was becoming more and more

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,020
prevalent and buying Microsoft and not

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,340
getting involved in open source they

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,680
weren't playing on a level playing field

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,060
with everybody else so we needed to get

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,580
more involved and needed to structure

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,460
our business in a way where our business

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,780
models were a lot more open-source

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,520
friendly you know where we could do

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,130
stuff and be an become treating to open

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,930
source and and it work it be sustainable

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,689
so that contribution is one thing I

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,299
would ask you about you guys seem to be

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:44,880
contributing back a lot and being good

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,710
stewards in the community okay of open

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,299
source project yeah that's good to see

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,060
that perception outside I certainly hope

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,720
we are and one of the things I spend a

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,250
lot of time with when we when we start

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
an introducing open source into the

00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,460
company and you know doing that whole

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,490
change management exercise we're

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,219
stressing the importance of contributing

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,649
back to open source projects and the way

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,270
I explained it to you know managers in

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,160
Microsoft you haven't been doing open

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,940
source through their entire careers you

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,370
know was it

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,110
bit like taking a you know when you

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,350
branched off from somebody else's code

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,080
if you're not continuously integrating

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,600
with that with that other branch then

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,100
it's very hard to pull new features over

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,900
so it's very hard for you to get that

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,670
code and bring it into your software so

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,550
what was the point using open-source at

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,390
all if you don't if you're forking so by

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,350
contributing back you can now take

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,640
upstream you can now take the open

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,530
source library and use it because it has

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,360
all the features you need and then you

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,740
get all the benefits of a testing and

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,240
the bug fixes and all the other features

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,130
everybody else has done so I certainly

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,260
feel that we're contributing back and we

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,910
seem we have a lot of people you know

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,530
with Microsoft email address is

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,720
contributing out to get hub now so

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,810
that's good what country we get to get

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,840
hub yeah that's what's you know and and

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,730
let's talk about that a little bit so

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,160
what does Microsoft bring to the table

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,200
for github let's not think about what

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,120
github brings from Microsoft yeah let's

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,760
wet flop that around and say what is

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,360
Microsoft bring to the table for github

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,950
yeah so it's probably worth saying you

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,600
know the point we're recording we've

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,130
just acquired we just announced we're

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,360
going to acquire github and that at the

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,730
point we're recording that deal hasn't

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,410
completed yet right so we're in though

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,970
you know the regulatory approval stages

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,050
we're going to go to regulators and

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,810
chatting with those people so we'll

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,370
probably have hopefully by the end of

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,320
the year that acquisition will be

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,790
complete the two companies have said yes

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,980
the two companies have said yes the

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,510
boards of the two companies said yes now

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,400
we just have to hope everybody else is

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,690
happy with that right now the two

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,120
companies are operating entirely

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,230
independently and and are separate

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,530
companies as well as we're recording

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,880
this now anyway but back to the original

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,739
question which I'm turning over now oh

00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,160
yeah what does one Microsoft bring to

00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:58,920
the table

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,209
what does Microsoft bring to the table

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:07,000
with github and a whole lot of resources

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,489
in terms of you know we've got a revenue

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,750
stream around Asia around some of our

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,840
products and things that we can use to

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,049
fund open source development and fund

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,350
development of github itself so you know

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,120
we really bring a big checkbook and we

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,550
also bring a lot of expertise in terms

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,129
of selling to the enterprise market

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,990
the whole enterprise Salesforce so

00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,780
hopefully we can help there and that's

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:35,500
it international cells exactly yeah

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,139
but the goal the goal would get hub is

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,159
to right now as I say the acquisition

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,979
hasn't finished so they're entirely

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:43,569
separate company even when they are

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,250
acquired into Microsoft they're gonna

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,370
come in it's a model we used with

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,919
LinkedIn as a wholly owned subsidiary

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,110
and so you know github we won't get up

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,370
to stay github we like github otherwise

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,319
we wouldn't have spent an awful lot of

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,879
money buying it you know so we need to

00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,159
we need them to keep their independence

00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,409
and be an open platform for developers

00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:04,240
and we need everybody else to know that

00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:05,979
this is an open platform developer so

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,020
they can't be you know tie things

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,150
directly into github it needs to be kind

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,210
of one level out so you were acquired

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,229
yes I think yeah I joined us necklaces

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,479
yeah so did your life change drastically

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:21,449
I was a much smaller acquisition than

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,419
than the github acquisition is you know

00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:28,900
starts with five people and what's been

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:30,490
fascinating for me I mean I was joining

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,029
from a start-up with five people joining

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,860
this huge company I wasn't sure how I

00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:37,479
was going to do how I was going to

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,740
survive if it was gonna be fun or not

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,710
but I was gonna you know do it for two

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,690
years see how it went and what's been

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,509
fascinating is that Microsoft have moved

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,419
more and more towards how I was working

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:51,819
so I haven't had to move to be Microsoft

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:53,500
Microsoft luckily this wasn't you know

00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,479
anything to do with me but Microsoft

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,789
have moved more and more to how I wanted

00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,979
to work move more to open-source more

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,599
move more into not just windows

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,400
development or cross-platform Levante

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,029
developing for Mac and for Linux and

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,919
everything else

00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,750
developing the much more agile way

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,129
developing in a more DevOps way all

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,889
these things have happened so it's been

00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:14,229
it's been great for me github with

00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,879
having you know obviously that being a

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,770
separate entity and having that brand

00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,270
affinity with developers because

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,669
developers are such a key important

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,849
audience for Microsoft there and even in

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,960
an even stronger position because

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:29,289
Microsoft don't want to mess that up you

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,919
know it this is we've been telling

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,199
people hey

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,030
you know we're more open source friendly

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,569
now we're you know we're sort of

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,969
demonstrating by our we're not we're not

00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,949
trying to make people trust us we're

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,990
gonna show people what we are this is

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,659
who we are now this is how we're

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,999
contributing if we were to mess the

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,169
whole thing up then no then we've lost

00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:53,719
that we'll lose the trust of a

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,520
generation of developers so they're in a

00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:57,979
much stronger position I think so what

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,860
would your biggest piece of advice be to

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:02,479
a github er coming into Microsoft yeah I

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,400
would say the let's say the acquisition

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,189
happens I think yes forward yeah

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,979
day one what changes for github is

00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,930
anything or and they'll get a blue badge

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,189
with the you know which was I remember

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,020
when I got acquired that was WOW

00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,650
Microsoft badge that's when it became

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,719
real and they get access to a whole

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,370
bunch of toys that they didn't get

00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:26,060
access to in terms of resources and

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,550
people I can pick up the phone speak to

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,129
like Eric gamma or Anders hallsburg or

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,620
there's absolute legends my I think my

00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,830
advice would be not to get carried away

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,990
you were you don't get carried away too

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,169
much and don't try and please too much

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,909
because when you get acquired it's it

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,080
might be different for those coming in

00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:49,189
as a big team that's staying together

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,800
but it's very it's very tempting to sort

00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:54,740
of oh you know to want to please you

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,789
know to be a puppy well I want to do

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,949
what you want me to do whatever you want

00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,569
me to don't I focus on doing what you're

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:00,740
doing they're amazing at delivering what

00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,110
they're doing they've done got an

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,000
amazing product they're amazing and you

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,469
know affinity with developers focus on

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,349
that stay good at what you're good at

00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:11,389
and then look around and see what you

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,069
can leverage that Microsoft's got that

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,810
you can build on so maybe some of the

00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:17,029
enterprise Salesforce maybe some of our

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,870
cloud platform maybe some of the machine

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:24,770
learning in a ideologies you know good

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,659
book do that very very deliberately in

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,969
in a controlled way so that you're not

00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,289
always you'll get lost you know you need

00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,000
to focus on delivering because that's

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,979
kind of why why you were bought because

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,589
you know so focus on that first so is

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,570
the culture at Microsoft still changing

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,590
is it shifting are you guys in like a

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,440
transformation

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,940
I think it's always a shion's always

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,720
change internal transfer continual

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,730
transformation one of the interesting

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,160
things about Microsoft is it's very it's

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,430
very deliberate transformation and it's

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,380
a very sachet causative growth mindset

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,500
but it's such an endeavour to you

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,720
it's very much how deliberately thinking

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,580
about how to get better and that's

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,430
DevOps really isn't it you know a

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,260
continual improvement process how do we

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,840
improve how we do business how do we

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,800
deliver more value into the hands of our

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,880
customers quicker at higher quality and

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,220
Microsoft's continually changing so

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,100
open-source you know the open source

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,810
culture has definitely sort of infected

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,580
Microsoft the more and more people that

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,070
are contributing to open source projects

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,990
the more you see the culture of

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,630
Microsoft changed so I think we spoke

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,380
last year about inner source kind of

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,000
people contributing to you know sharing

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,260
and collaborating in a very open source

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,390
way inside the enterprise that's

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,020
definitely happened but it's also small

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,970
things like we're still a very email

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,090
centric culture we use teams a lot now

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:53,090
you know X type stuff use those types of

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,920
things but we're still very email

00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,470
centric and I remember somebody on the

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,790
team you know when when you have a baby

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,610
and things you send out the obligatory

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,350
you know we've had a baby email and

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,330
everybody goes we know nice baby email

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,970
sort of thing and this particular

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,980
submitted EV on the.net team sent out to

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,780
hey we've had a baby here's my baby sort

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,390
of thing and the first comment back was

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,910
+1 looks good to merge so the thing yeah

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,980
open-source is infected the org so that

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,680
was great to see yeah one of the things

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,960
that github do really well is their

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,570
entire their entire business runs on

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,970
github from what I can tell so their

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,920
lawyers use github so they're they're

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,710
eating their own they either undock

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,900
vinum Microsoft do that already and so I

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,370
work on the team of the STS team visual

00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,080
studio team services team we build a lot

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,870
the engineering tools for Microsoft and

00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:48,300
we use VST s to deploy the STS

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:49,860
but the but that the limit is our dev

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,290
team you know we don't have the lawyers

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,850
using it we don't have marketing use it

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,390
get over in their entire business on

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,120
github

00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,910
lawyers send pull requests lawyers you

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,010
know people in hrs it makes sense it

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,480
really does yeah and I'd like to see

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,980
some of that that would be great to see

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,290
some that come into the company as well

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,779
you know like some a bit more about some

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,450
dog food culture that they've got the

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,190
whole way yeah it's great to see ya so

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,290
if you were to project a year out from

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,200
now again like let's say yeah I hope

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,150
that I opened up with that's pretty I'm

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
not gonna get a good record of that so

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,779
you know because there could be more

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,980
acquisitions coming you know knows you

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,770
know we don't know what the appetite

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,150
yeah yeah so I know our core like my

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,920
boss he's corporate and makes he's maxed

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,660
out right now anyway said that Friedman

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,100
he's been of even you so yeah we're

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,750
saying he's gonna be the new CEO get

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,150
when he comes in now okay

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,820
and I can't honestly can't think of a

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:44,010
better new CEO for github than that

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,360
and the fact that he gets to bring the

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,830
resources and Michael because he's got a

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,650
ton of experience in like the known

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,390
world and xamarin so he's been acquired

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,970
by Microsoft before and when he came

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,020
from Microsoft he was working at xamarin

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,610
and they had an expensive commercial

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,410
product which he's now open-source you

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,810
know so he's used to that being enabled

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,339
so yeah he's gonna be an amazing CEO for

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,490
more debates in San Francisco so sorry

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,320
you're saying the question if ya we sit

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,600
down twelve months yeah what would you

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,180
like to say has happened during this

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,400
period of time like what switch wits

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,020
fast forward yeah so together hopefully

00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,040
by then the acquisition will be complete

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,320
hopefully our lights have seen that the

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,220
world didn't end and you know ever that

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,420
the you know the the strongest fears of

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,250
some of the people on like you know

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,600
Reddit and I can use and think some of

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,820
those things haven't haven't come to

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,060
pass and that get hub stronger than it

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,130
has been

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,750
and he's progressing really well and

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,540
having a good velocity of delivering

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,350
features to developers I'd like to see

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:47,320
Microsoft's culture it would be great to

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,420
see some more of the the github flow

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:54,520
type models working in so you know

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,470
reviewing reviewing blog posts with PR

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,330
people using pull requests or some of

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,010
those types of changes starting to come

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,190
into the core building on top of that to

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:06,070
review the yeah yeah and then also we

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,540
continue in our DevOps journey so we've

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,430
been doing our DevOps journey for nearly

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,610
ten years now and you know DevOps is

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,890
never a destination it's always

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,450
improvement I think there's a lot of

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,550
things we can learn from each other in

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,410
terms of like live site cultures how we

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,450
keep us you know github service

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,640
availability is just phenomenal

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,170
like how what we know what could be

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,790
learned from that some of those sorts of

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,150
things as well it's gonna be fascinating

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,470
to see it's gonna be it's really

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,730
exciting to actually work at Microsoft

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,530
so you're really talking about a

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,510
continual transformation you're never

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,210
going to stop changing growth and

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:44,550
changing you know you got to get better

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:47,350
they're getting better on my team

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:50,680
we've I say we've been on our DevOps

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:53,020
journey we delivered more features last

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,600
year than we did in the previous four

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,220
years combined and that's because we're

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
continually trying to improve our

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,730
velocity and continue trying to you know

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,650
get better at doing things and I see

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,450
that happening across the whole org and

00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,220
different parts of a large company like

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,690
Microsoft move at different speeds so

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,360
the great to see everybody you know

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,860
moving along this same line but no yeah

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,780
continual transformation let's hope so

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,430
yep excellent Martin we look forward

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,430
that conversation thank you much ticker
