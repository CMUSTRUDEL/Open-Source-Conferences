hi this is Mike Hendrickson velocity

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,879
2018 in San Jose I'm here with Dave from

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,560
Verizon digital media services Dave how

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,859
you doing good nice to be here thanks

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,639
Mike

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,570
so bryson digital media services what is

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,369
that it's a lot in what a lot of words

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,430
so a Verizon digital media services was

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,100
formed in the in around 2014 we brought

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,010
the hcar CDN together with another

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,140
startup out of Utah called uplink who

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,090
provide a video streaming solution the

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,500
idea being that bringing those two

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
things together we can offer something

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,219
that not many other people can which is

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,860
a full end-to-end video solution

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,300
leveraging one of the fastest and

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,090
largest city ends in the world

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,760
so fastest and largest CDNs in the world

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,460
what what do you do with your CDN who

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,160
gets access to it and so we're a full

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,899
commercial CDN anyone can can sign up

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,500
and use a CDN we have approximately a

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,649
hundred thousand active customers it's

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,329
we do everybody we do from like the

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,039
smallest e-commerce website all the way

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,060
up through like major broadcasters who

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,350
are leveraging a video solution and it's

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,100
actually pretty interesting we've built

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,110
the CDN to handle a variety of use cases

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,610
it's very different to be delivering

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,979
like lots and lots of video very quickly

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,950
then trying to do accelerating someone's

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,720
website so we spend a lot of time

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,920
optimizing and making making all the

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,780
systems that we have kind of

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,880
automatically scale and adjust for like

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,840
a wide range of use cases so the short

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
answer is anyone can use it

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,650
anyone can are there industries that

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,900
seem to gravitate towards to folks

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,850
because I mean media seems like you live

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,579
in a yeah I mean it's right there in the

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,210
name right like so and yes we service a

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,009
lot of media customers it's not just

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,590
media customers oh we end up with a very

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,140
interesting like spread for example we

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,880
do a lot of airlines throughout you know

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,649
if you're booking website you double

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,420
through like a pack or Scandinavia

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,490
chances are you using the EDUCAUSE CDN

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,899
we don't and it's it tends to be kind of

00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,939
regional it's very interesting in the

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,130
u.s. it's basically across all sectors

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,310
and all domains we work with with lots

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,750
and lots of partners lots of resellers

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,360
and yeah we provide services to whoever

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,340
wants a fast safe reliable website and

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,650
is this worldwide errs especially North

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,290
America no no worldwide we

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,269
deployed in all six comments I say all

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,030
six no one to my knowledge has a pop in

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,430
and talk to you yet all six continents

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,470
we have 125 points of presence at the

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,439
moment we have 50 turrets of egress

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,970
capacity by the time anyone watches this

00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,189
that number will be higher but yes we're

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,230
growing as quickly as we can

00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:36,870
yes no we're we're a global a global

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,299
company and what would you say is the

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,430
biggest advantage of a corporation using

00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:44,489
you guys as opposed to someone else oh

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,290
great question I think one of the things

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,930
that Verizon carries with it is kind of

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,230
a reputation for reliability I think

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,609
that really resonates with customers who

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,440
you know your web property these days is

00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,450
like your front like one of your most

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,340
public facing components to your

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,349
business you can't really afford

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,480
downtime it's very expensive and it

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,189
reflects negatively on you so you need

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,799
to partner with someone who has that

00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:08,459
kind of ethos of reliability and

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,430
performance

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,590
I think Verizon chose very wisely buying

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,680
etch gusts h gus is the fastest CDN in

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,540
the world and partnering with Verizon

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,250
we've been able to kind of scale

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,169
everything up to have just enormous

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,419
capacity to handle basically anyone's

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,639
traffic profile and EdgeCast EdgeCast

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,680
came from working at the edge or edge

00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,049
gus was the name of one of the companies

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,560
that write verizon acquired and do you

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:38,280
run CD CNS all over I mean at the edge

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,199
of a corporate network and it's it's a

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,419
merciful all of the data centers are in

00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,519
kind of like data centers all around the

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,940
world so we we and we kind of you know

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,560
that's ours we rent that from data

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,109
center providers that's what I mean when

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,690
I refer to the edge so we don't we don't

00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,340
delve into like on-prem okay type stuff

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,459
okay so it's okay

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,579
so where do you see edge cast and and

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,840
Verizon digital media services in let's

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,129
say six months mmm

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,049
and then I want you to look further out

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,979
and look at like where would you like to

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,389
be in the long term good questions we

00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:15,359
have a couple of really exciting things

00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:18,109
kind of brewing that will be released in

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,760
the in the next six months the

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:24,479
fundamental principle that we have is

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,889
like acetic the everyone's capacity

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,870
requirements are always growing like

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,370
okay is gonna drop soon it's gonna go

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,289
mainstream it's it's available in some

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,580
formats but not others the uptick there

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,529
is going to be huge you're gonna need

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,199
someone that has a lot of capacity to be

00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,310
able to deliver that to your customers

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,620
so because of that we're continuously

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,639
investing in the CDN to just scale up to

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,930
meet everyone's demands because when the

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,639
other things that we really offer is

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,909
this kind it's right here my t-shirt is

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,590
like security so I'm sure we're all

00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:55,419
familiar with like DDoS attacks

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,599
Lightspeed with your shields up

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,669
exactly so nice and fast and secure so

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:03,939
but I mean the element of security that

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm trying to drive that is it's very

00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:09,939
very hard to protect against DDoS is if

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,560
you don't have enough capacity to absorb

00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,150
them there I mean we do lots of

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,919
intelligent things to mitigate them to

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,310
absorb them yeah so you have to absorb

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,180
them first before you use theirs I mean

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,560
it's actually pretty it's actually

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,419
pretty interesting I mean there you know

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,069
there's a range of DDoS attacks and we

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:26,349
protect everything from layer three and

00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:28,689
four which is like very kind of low

00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:30,580
level but also pretty dumb attacks where

00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,500
they're literally just trying to flood

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,969
your systems with more or less nonsense

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,589
all the way up to layer seven attacks

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:37,419
which are probe which are typically more

00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:40,089
targeted at our customers so they may be

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,500
targeting not by request volume but

00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:45,490
targeting a specific part of your

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,379
website for example if you have a search

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,240
function on your website and that search

00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:51,279
function you've implemented to read your

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,020
database the database is going to be the

00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,550
source point so if someone can if

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,899
someone can just target that with a lot

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,120
of queries and tip over your database

00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:01,000
then your whole website potentially goes

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,649
down so being able to like to protect

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,969
against all of those things is very

00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,229
important so we have a whole product

00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,569
built around protecting our customers

00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,879
origins and when we deploy massive

00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,589
amounts of infrastructure with kind of

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,000
intelligent systems that actually we've

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:15,370
talked at velocity about previously

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,490
built on top of the the kind of shear

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,960
capacity that we have that effectively

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,889
block it as quickly as we can but to get

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,870
back to your earlier question about

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,029
where are we going yeah in the kind of

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,469
next six months there's a couple of

00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,149
really interesting features so built on

00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,560
top of kind of scaling everything out to

00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,060
meet customers demand so some really

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,180
exciting features that we have that I

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,849
think the velocity crowd will be will be

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,039
really excited about and I mentioned

00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:40,750
some of them in my keynote but moving to

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,480
a real-time everything

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,750
and giving our customers complete

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:51,370
control over our CBN and that sounds

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:54,730
scary when I say it like that but the

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,700
point there is that if I'm a customer I

00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,620
want to I want to be able to get the CDN

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,800
to do what I want when I want it because

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,530
if I don't like the whole goal there is

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,220
to be able to keep my website as fast

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,740
and performant and up and if things take

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,540
too much time or if I am NOT protected

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,700
for making a mistake or if I can't see

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,410
what's happening what what a CDN is

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,140
doing on my behalf that becomes very

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,520
difficult so we're about to deploy a

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,919
bunch of so I release a bunch of

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,560
features that are called edge control

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,320
which are specifically geared for that

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,930
everything is real-time every change is

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,760
you can stage and tests and it's much

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,650
much more developer-friendly than than

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,750
our existing stuff and giving customers

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,520
more control yes it's it's entirely

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,070
geared around giving customers control

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,470
of exactly what they want to do when and

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,910
then real-time feedback so they can see

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,580
whether or not the thing that they asked

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,720
the CDN to do is is doing what they

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,100
expected and whether it's improving

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,200
things or actually and if it's

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,950
unexpectedly making things worse and are

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,090
you starting to use AI to help with

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,150
these sort of things as well especially

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:04,840
like detecting anomalies and you know

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,060
loss attacks and yes absolutely all of

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,040
those things and so we're using AI in

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,780
quite a few places we use it for anomaly

00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,990
detection for identifying kind of

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,370
erroneous traffic called erroneously

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,530
potentially malicious traffic hitting

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,370
customers origins and we're also using

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:24,910
it in the the Web Application Firewall

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,220
component which is more designed to

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,080
block nuran attacks rather than over

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,120
rather than protecting someone from like

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,039
a just too many of things which are

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
valid it's more trying to identify

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,789
things which are known to be bad so we

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,380
have some interesting projects kind of

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,479
bringing together a lot of different

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,060
data sources that we have from low level

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,470
all the way up through high level and we

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,020
have some interesting kind of models

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,160
that we're deploying to the edge to help

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,700
with that it's kind of it's kind of

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,100
exciting

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,270
excellent so six to twelve months from

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,030
now we're gonna see a total different

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,100
offering from you guys uh one screamers

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,320
more customers more control that that

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,240
will be kind of a brand new offering for

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,010
us will be very exciting

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,540
the the integration with the other

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,850
components of security stuff will

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,100
probably more be iterative we just

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,780
brought out executives people that kind

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,840
of integrated in one of the nice things

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,310
about AI and machine learning is that if

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,710
it does its job well you don't know that

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,480
it's there which is great and it keeps

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,610
doing it and it keeps doing it yes it's

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,380
great and you know we our security

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,170
offering just got reviewed by Forrest

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,850
and Sullivan very very and was reviewed

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,440
very very favorably which is which is

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,660
great to see it's it's kind of nice to

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,880
see the the hard work we put in get kind

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,200
of some ministry recognition excellent

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,820
well day we look forward to six to

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,820
twelve months from now as funds thanks

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,670
