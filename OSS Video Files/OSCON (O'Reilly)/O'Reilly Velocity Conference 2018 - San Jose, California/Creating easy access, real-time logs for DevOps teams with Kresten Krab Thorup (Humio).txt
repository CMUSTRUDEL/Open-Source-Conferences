hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,390
velocity 2018 in San Jose I'm here with

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,929
Creston from Neil how you doing

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,500
fine thanks so humne oh yeah what do you

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:16,020
guys do well we do lock analytics so

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,609
basically we run a piece of we've built

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,670
a piece of software that you can run

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,279
either in our cloud use our cloud or you

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,800
could run it yourself and basically you

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,650
send your locks there and then you could

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,769
search them or you can pull data out of

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,790
them and graph it and build dashboards

00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:37,770
for your operations team DevOps teams do

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,559
incident report an incident response

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,040
basically searching into it so that that

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,410
kind of feedback loop with the locks

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,539
that come out of your systems so can I

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,370
just use grep on my own logs or you guys

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,960
have something you've added to this to

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,840
make it a little better sure I mean at

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,489
the core human was very much that grep

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,230
on steroids right but if you if you're

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,149
running a complex system so so what's

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,730
happening is today of course with micro

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,489
services and cloud and distributed

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,680
systems your systems are running on you

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,110
know tens hundreds thousands of

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,150
computers and it's not really feasible

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,490
to run grep across a thousand machines

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,159
so so so you're bringing all the locks

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,320
together in one place and and store them

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,009
so you can really efficiently grab them

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,240
right that's a that's the core of it but

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,340
then once you've grabbed something a

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,979
found something you can also select like

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,689
I want this piece of information and say

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,380
I want to build a time chart over that

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:37,770
or histogram or pie charts and whatnot

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,930
and and and then that's really that's

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,689
really informative for it for dev team

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,149
or some kind of operations team to sit

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,409
there and say hmm is that is that normal

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,049
does that look normal

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,689
so do you find some of the stories in

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,100
the data - or do you you find the

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,500
anomalies and the patterns or is that

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,290
for the user to visualize and then find

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,110
for themselves well typically there'll

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:09,140
be there'll be some some some people who

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,200
built these des portes right

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,660
and then a lot more people who use right

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,870
so it could be use it as a way to build

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,180
a rapport but instead of building like a

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,980
PDF report you just built a live report

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,930
where you can just send your boss a link

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,420
and say go look this is what it looks

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,690
like right now so there's different

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,840
kinds of users but the interesting thing

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,970
is because once you build the dashboard

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,770
as soon as you click on something you

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,660
end up in this search field where you

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,410
can just like refine the search yourself

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:46,100
so it's once you have something up and

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,810
running it's easy for developers to kind

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,720
of dive into the locks themselves and

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,720
that's that's a it's a surprising

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,390
experience when you have you know easy

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,330
access to the locks and often that

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,980
feedback loop that ends up getting the

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,810
happening is that people realize this is

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,400
it's really easy and then they add some

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,260
more logs to the system and then you go

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,459
look for them and you could get easily

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:14,150
built like adhoc little metrics or extra

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:17,209
things that you may get out of get out

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,670
of how the system works right so if I

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,030
have a bunch of logs and I send them to

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,049
you guys

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,630
you make them accessible for me yes and

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,850
if I build them into a dashboard and

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,549
then I send you more logs does it update

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,930
is it like a real-time sure that's one

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,650
of the big one of the big

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:40,510
differentiators from our competitors is

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:44,840
that is these dashboards are truly live

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,900
so where most of products in this space

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,560
basically take in the logs and then put

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,829
them in a database building indexes and

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,620
then the dashboard part is the question

00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:02,739
of every 30 seconds or every minute so

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:05,780
you go run a query and a brass board so

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,660
it's what we do is basically a streaming

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,850
query mechanism right where for all the

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,269
desperate components they become part of

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:17,299
the ingest pipeline so they keep a and

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:20,090
they maintain a real-time view of what's

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,630
the time window of what some computation

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,090
is the number of arrows or

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,340
last five minutes for a simple thing or

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,860
what does the time chart look like for

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:34,410
something over the last twenty four days

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:36,180
or not and that's kept in memory so so

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,010
the the dashboards are really truly live

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,510
and that also means the alerting

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:44,190
mechanism is truly live right so that's

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,480
that's one part that's different the

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,820
other part that's different is we don't

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,780
built those indexes so so in a typical

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,450
say a database based logging solution

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,780
right you take in say a terabyte of data

00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,520
and put it in an enormous that bloat

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,550
to like between five and ten terabytes

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,590
because the indexes are bigger than the

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,940
original data there's kind of a typical

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,010
time-space trade-off you do that I do

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,500
you bloat the data to make it fast to

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,660
search it and they need that because

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,240
every 30 seconds there's a new query

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,220
coming in now we just get away with all

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,070
that and just compute it kind of in

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,840
memory and flow as a streaming query

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,520
under underway in and we just save all

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,620
the events compress them and save all

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,380
the events so they said the one terabyte

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,160
of data that you push in turns into 100

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,440
megabytes so that's that's 1/10 whereas

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,520
a typical database thing is like 5 to 10

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,490
X bigger so you can easily get in

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,810
situation where there's you only need a

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,180
50th of the disk storage so and they've

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,820
lots of these things add up to reduce

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,980
the complexity of the system means it's

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,620
easier to operate there's less data to

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,810
move around to backup does this human

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,890
require someone who thinks in a DevOps

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:08,820
way I mean I do do regular organizations

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:13,590
that don't think about that use a tool

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:16,740
like you milk typical organ I say since

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,970
I mean there's a couple different ways

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,770
to look at it right there's people who

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:23,310
want a point solution they want to say

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,710
well we have we have access logs from

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,410
web server and we just want some

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,700
pre-built - ports that you know show us

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,770
everything about this and we don't want

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,300
to care about it that's typically not

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,890
our kind of customer like we want to

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,520
peel we want to tinker with it a little

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:41,310
bit so our typical customer has some

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,200
some people who want to tinker and a lot

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,290
more users who just want to want to use

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,110
the dashboards but definitely it's a but

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,550
it's like selling Excel I guess imagine

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,919
you're selling the spreadsheet Excel way

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,470
we provide something it doesn't have any

00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,880
data in it and no functions but as soon

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,590
as you put some interesting data and it

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,630
build some functions other people can

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,310
use that and then the tinkers will use

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,780
pivot tables and look-up tables

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,070
exactly right exactly yeah yeah so if

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,010
you were to look at humo

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,490
in the market right now and say you know

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,229
where you are

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,090
mm-hmm where do you want to be in six

00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:20,520
months and then where do you want to be

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:22,620
a year from now so so we're seeing in

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,419
the marketplaces all the all the

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,340
interesting customers or unprimed

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,020
customers so this was really built for

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,669
running in their own in their own

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,669
organization so these are like

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:35,250
financials so healthcare protective and

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:38,070
protective environment and that's kind

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,520
of where we came from admittedly more

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:43,620
from a DevOps perspective but so we're

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,200
seeing now is these are gonna say sins

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,060
and high-volume data because it turns

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,700
out the big differentiator for us is

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,940
unpretty ball um--

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,130
and that's that's what we're what we're

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,810
struggling with you could say now that's

00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,550
our challenge now is as a small company

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,500
they're really interesting customers

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,630
that could really use this are huge

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,669
enterprises right so we're learning how

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,430
to navigate huge enterprises how to sell

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:11,190
to them all this so I'd be super happy

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,930
to have six months from now you know we

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,310
have 15 20 large enterprise customers

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,330
we're talking to a lot but you know

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,610
there's lots of interesting challenges

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,740
in going there what is a large

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,960
enterprise customer like yeah it's a big

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,539
bank that you think know the name of or

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,680
big financial institutions big

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,169
manufacturer of three hundred ten

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,180
thousand people typically the ones that

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:36,839
are interested now are you know tech

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:41,710
savvy customers so the large internet

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:44,190
enterprises no cloud companies

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:47,620
but so companies that are in this world

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,540
doing a digital transformation that -

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,990
yeah we shouldn't people in that

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:55,630
category be interested in injury like

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,210
God there's a couple of big banks that

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,690
are doing their own internal platform

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,430
for like running kubernetes and having

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,800
individual teams being able to kind of

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,260
pull these services in so in that case

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,480
humor is an ideal thing the Brun you get

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,400
a full multi-tenant solution that they

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,240
can run in service to their internal

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,250
customers so yes and so you guys run

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,890
with pretty much any stack that someone

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,890
has sure as long as there's a log file

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,230
as long as there's a log file yeah and

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:28,000
and any kind of log file I mean any kind

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,320
of yeah you'd write some regular

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,700
expressions or different but there's

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,400
different ways of kind of getting the

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,380
data in and that's of course one of the

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,840
challenges also is people have all kinds

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,970
of different log files and that's part

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,350
where you have to do some manual work to

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,330
make sure all the different kinds of

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,460
data so yeah so in six months I'd be

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,040
really happy to have between happy happy

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:53,860
to have ten fifteen twenty large

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:55,840
enterprise customers I don't know that's

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,440
as far as I can see yeah six months is

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,570
easier to see twelve months is like

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:06,930
where is the whole log file industry

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:09,430
going to be a year from now there is I

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,410
don't know it's gonna be how would I

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,280
know hey I can have a role on there

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,620
maybe it's a limited and limited role

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,360
there's something that you could you

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,670
know all this AI and machine learning

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,990
you know it needs a sprinkle of domain

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,150
knowledge that's one of the things we've

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,870
learned 3 yeah so you can't just apply

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,460
it like blindly humans oh so another

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,250
area where we actually having a big

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,560
uptake is security like network security

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,530
monitoring security operations of

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,790
various kinds and I could easily imagine

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,790
some machine learning being used there

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,950
right so we're actually already using

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,660
some of our customers are using our API

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,970
is to pull out the data again filtered

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,500
and like putting it through some Python

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,240
scripts of their own but you need the

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,570
main Marland domain knowledge to be able

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,160
to apply any machine

00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:00,800
really and that's you know maybe we'll

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,010
have a branch a human security branch

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,980
that does have have a lot of security

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,180
domain knowledge and that would be a

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,890
reasonable place to also put some

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,010
machine learning in yeah I could easily

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,450
see that happening in a year right

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,490
excellent well question we look forward

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,940
to watching you guys on your journey oh

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,940
thank you

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,910
