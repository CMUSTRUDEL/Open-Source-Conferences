hi Roger here with beyond an usher from

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,300
blameless we'll get into the name in a

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,920
little bit but welcome and tell us what

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,710
kind of problem isn't that blameless is

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:19,369
trying to solve yeah so Roger about what

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,130
a few months ago there was a very large

00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:24,840
enterprise collaboration company I won't

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,670
actually name them but they actually had

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,949
a pretty major outage about two hours

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,900
worth of downtime in that entire quarter

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,360
and I like to use the story because I

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,969
call it the 8.2 million a ten million

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,820
dollar parking ticket which is that

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,469
because of that issue they had to end up

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,800
paying about ten million dollars in

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,260
service credits and their stock took a

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,730
big hit as well lost about two and a

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,010
half billion dollars in market value

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,070
just on that day because of that news

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,079
and I think to top it all off you had

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,480
the analysts in the industry saying like

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,850
hey their competitors are actually more

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,199
reliable more better much better and so

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,450
really the question becomes how you know

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,770
reliability is the most important

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,680
feature of any product that you're

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,720
building so huh and then what you're

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,369
balancing that against is moving really

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,369
really quickly and writing a bunch of

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,049
code and shipping software at incredible

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,210
paces so I'd actually balance those

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,920
things and what's been around is a set

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,600
of what you need is a set of practices

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,130
and principles that have actually been

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,320
around in the industry for about 15

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,689
years pioneered by folks like Google and

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,119
has evolved as its hit companies like

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,960
Netflix and others call that survey site

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,790
reliability engineering and so sre

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
really gives you the ability as a

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,729
developer as a software company to move

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,350
fast while not breaking actually or

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,369
maintaining your customers keeping your

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,280
customers happy

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,990
is really what it's about and so what to

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,820
answer your question the really the long

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,219
long winded way of saying it is what we

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,780
do is we take the SME practices of the

00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,909
the best companies of the world

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,950
and we make that accessible to every

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,750
single developer out there no matter

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,090
what sort of background or language that

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,129
they're using they can actually use the

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,380
blameless platform to actually ship code

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,900
as reliably as a Google or Netflix

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,540
mm-hmm so what is the vision and kind of

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,720
mechanics of what flameless is doing

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,170
mm-hmm so the vision is to have a

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,020
reliable customer experience bubbling up

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,700
all the encapsulating all the small

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,230
services and products anything that

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,840
bubbles up into that ultimately it's

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,150
what do people experience if you're

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,770
calling an uber to get your car on time

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,960
if you're booking a flight to get the

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,330
seat on the flight you need and this

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,130
customer experience a lot of there's a

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,960
lot of legacy in companies they aren't

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,210
geared to be software companies like in

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,040
Netflix like a Google how do you get

00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,590
them up to speed quickly and bridge that

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,510
gap regardless of what prior decisions

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,060
made that's really the the vision and

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,160
the first step is to measure what it is

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,050
and then set goals to incremental II

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,780
improve and that incremental continuous

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,320
improvement is part of what is at the

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,690
core of blameless great so what you

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,280
mentioned facing things in Google what

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,800
extra things are you guys bringing to

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,480
the table and I think elaborating of

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,220
that people who didn't start up a

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,050
software companies they're trying to

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,180
adapt to it for what them is kind of a

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,550
brave new world it's probably something

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,670
of interest yeah yeah about the ships

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,610
yeah so there's a there's a few shifts

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,040
that are happening so one is where

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,680
there's more and more dependence on

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,600
third-party cloud like services right so

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,130
what you end up having inside your as

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,860
you're becoming a more of a software

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:40,470
company is this proliferation of tooling

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,420
particularly around monitoring and

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,140
observability and continuous integration

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,930
and continuous delivery and you know

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,030
logging and so it really it becomes hard

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,190
to really manage all that information

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,510
and so the the immediate reaction of

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,970
teams is to go and hire more people

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,890
which then becomes a catch-22 which is I

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,570
can't really hire more people and I'm in

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,730
this mode of constantly churning and

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,860
trying to you know just keep my head

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,800
above the water the other thing that's

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,510
happening is that businesses reliability

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,340
has now become not an engineering

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,430
problem but it's a business problem

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,350
right so your reliability the the person

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,810
who owns reliability now has a seat at

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,220
the table with this the other c-level

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,120
executives that are out there and you

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,410
know the the

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,280
third shift that's happening is that

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:31,169
there is really no one best way of doing

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,199
reliability management right it's all

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:36,810
dependent on your business and what your

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,520
users really care about and so so what

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,970
we've done is our unique approach is

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,250
number one that's actually sit on top of

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,130
and be the central nervous system plus

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,870
the brain that sort of orchestrate

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,930
everything that you need all the human

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,639
activity needed to actually resolve you

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,229
know these issues faster prevent them

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,210
from happening again make sure that the

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,610
code that's going out is stable in the

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,320
first place so we have this kind of

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,240
intelligence layer that's built on top

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,430
of all these different tools what that

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,010
means is you don't have to think of us

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,590
as another tool that sort of added on

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,110
into this you know this proliferation of

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,840
tooling that's out there but really 10

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,840
Xing the ROI on the existing platforms

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,630
that you have in place the second thing

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,160
is you know Google has a certain way an

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,169
opinion of doing things but so does

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,940
Netflix and so does Facebook and so

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,919
these and all of them are successful in

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,590
their own ways so what we've said is

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,240
we're gonna take the best practices of

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,400
all these different companies versus

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,560
just focusing on one and make that

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,479
accessible make sre as a practice

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,580
accessible to every single developer and

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,130
have them choose what works best for

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,130
them and their business right and again

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,560
the third thing is always this focus on

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,200
the making the data available at the

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,449
business level and making sure that you

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,340
know your board and your c-level

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,889
executives are always aware and bought

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,180
into you know what does reliability mean

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,789
and why it's important to us as a

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,340
business and using that as a driver for

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:08,039
business types of decisions so that's

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,910
kind of what are sort of unique view on

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:13,289
the world is you know we're not sort of

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,389
you know bucket it into a very specific

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:18,180
categories ISM you had mentioned some

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,320
analytics and talking to developers in

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,810
that kind of intellect space can you

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,180
elaborate a little on that yeah so I

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,280
mean you know the nature of being this

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,789
central nervous system is that you're

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,039
connected into every single part of the

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,800
developer flow all the way from when the

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,780
code is actually being written to

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,030
when it's being tested to when it's

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,560
actually running in production which

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,300
means that if we're connected to all of

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,759
these were absorbing we're becoming this

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,310
sink of data and so then the question

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,110
becomes well set as a human being

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,229
somebody has to take that data and make

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:54,289
it be turn that into knowledge and make

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,550
that be actionable and well what better

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,289
way to do that then actually have a

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,169
system in place that actually does that

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:02,240
for you right and in today's world

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,909
everything is about you know everybody

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,800
there's this proliferation of knowledge

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,360
workers and really it's about how do you

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,069
make them more effective and more

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,770
powerful particularly in the software

00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,810
development great ok you have a unique

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,419
name there's got to be a reason behind

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,710
it and I'm guessing there's something to

00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,680
do with your company culture that you'd

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,729
pick a name like that yeah I would say

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,039
oh sure and I have both been at

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,710
companies where there's been blame when

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,930
something goes wrong it's and then the

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,340
instinct is well who who messed it up

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:37,099
and when you look into it it's no one

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,130
because we collectively made a series of

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,960
decisions to expose certain

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,310
vulnerabilities and maybe is the right

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,650
thing to do to move faster

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,199
but now when down the road you have

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,020
these decisions that were optimal at

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,539
them at the time but imperfect what

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,789
happens and then so the essence of what

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:59,150
it takes to improve is to first realize

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,430
that blame is going to slow everything

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,500
down if you're not comfortable when

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,940
something goes wrong saying well what

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,340
happened here and you're not comfortable

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,370
saying well John made John made a

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,979
mistake by doing this if that person

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,630
feels blamed and that will get in the

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,460
way of you fixing the issue so you have

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,250
to resolve that as a cultural thing and

00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,050
really having that embedded into some of

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,389
these large fortune 500 companies where

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,330
there's still literal finger-pointing at

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,650
times that is a big cultural change but

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,940
if you're able to do that as we've seen

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,460
with some companies adopting that

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,029
philosophy then you can really speed

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,839
things up

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:38,599
the second is without blame you remove

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,070
fear so now you are free to go and

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,630
strive to improve and fail because if

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,670
you're doing something novel it may not

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,160
work and you can go push on that

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,930
and I think to one of your questions is

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,790
this concept of blameless doesn't just

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,620
apply to engineering and product it

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,140
applies to marketing it applies to sales

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,850
it applies to product design if you have

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,030
a design that didn't work out as planned

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,350
how do you iterate and improve how do

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,210
you do that with your marketing so it's

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,890
really it starts with engineering

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,230
product has where that's our background

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,080
and easily measured but it actually

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,960
applies to multiple areas and that as a

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,790
whole is what we kind of want to do as a

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,950
company but we we want to help other

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,020
teams at least adopt a blameless

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,570
postmortem culture when they're looking

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,710
at engineering and product issues that's

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,990
something a really interesting approach

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,400
so thanks to you both for your time

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,640
today yeah yeah thank you

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,640
thank you

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,170
