00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,870
I've been wanting to go to this

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,790
particular conference a long time it's

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,969
finally got a chance here this one of my

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,190
favorite conferences so I'm back this

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,800
year again I was fortunate to come with

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,680
a small team for my company last year

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,359
and we highly recommended it so we have

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,250
a lot more people here this year the

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,900
networking is fantastic there's nothing

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,820
like sharing a problem sharing your

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,560
challenges sharing those successes as

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,449
well and suck on is a great place to do

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,550
that you can walk away with an answer

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,280
which is unique it's not a sales pitch

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,550
it's an actual real real-world problems

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,739
here real-world solutions based on the

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,110
breadth of topics I think that there's

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,110
something for everyone there have been

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,710
very specific developer talks there have

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,570
been talks that are rated tor CTOs and

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,680
engineering babies and architects

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,990
obviously so really is something from I

00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,940
had a colleague

00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,570
Riley conferences to me because of the

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,799
focus on diversity as far as people so I

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,409
went to a diversity lunch yesterday

00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,369
great folks from that

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:12,229
really awesome

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:14,179
whether you're a beginner whether you're

00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:16,789
seasons just a wealth of knowledge that

00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:18,909
can be shared by all and so I took this

00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:20,960
opportunity first chance I could to

00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,180
start learning about how to become a

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:31,159
software

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:31,159
