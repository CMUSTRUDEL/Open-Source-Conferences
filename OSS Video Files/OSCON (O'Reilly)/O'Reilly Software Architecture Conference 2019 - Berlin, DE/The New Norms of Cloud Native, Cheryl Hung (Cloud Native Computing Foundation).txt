	00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:07,010
kubernetes is rare if not unique in the

00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,099
open source world in that it was defined

00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,349
very early on as both a project and a

00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:15,139
community and there was a really

00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:17,119
conscious effort to expand the group of

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,949
people who could be part of this

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,720
community so let me look at how

00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:29,060
kubernetes has progressed since it

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:32,629
joined the CN CF so kubernetes is made

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:36,230
up of 1.1 million contributions for more

00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:39,230
than 35,000 people for more than 2,000

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,930
companies and contributor here is

00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:45,649
defined as someone who's made a comment

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:48,980
or a commit on one of the github repos

00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:54,260
so that could be on an issue or a pull

00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,870
request or something like that and these

00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,480
contributors are getting more diverse so

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:03,379
initially Google and Red Hat made up

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,089
about 85% of the contributions so over

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:07,520
time Google and Red Hat continue to

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,759
contribute but today they only make up

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,860
about 35% which is a good sign because

00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:17,299
it means that more companies can

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:21,170
contribute it's also getting more

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:23,780
geographically diverse so contributors

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,990
come from more countries and after the

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:34,570
United States the second biggest country

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:39,439
is now China and then this graph plots

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:43,189
the open source projects by velocity so

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,320
the x-axis is the number of commits the

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,020
y-axis is the number of pull requests

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,049
and issues and then the size of the

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,229
bubble reflects the number of authors so

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,689
kubernetes is the pink bubble and then

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:02,570
linux is the purple one to the top right

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:05,990
of that and then cubic on cloud native

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,870
corn is also growing really rapidly so

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:13,360
this year 23,000 people are expected to

00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,360
