Title: The three-headed dog: Architecture, process, structure, Allen Holub (Holub Associates)
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2019 - Berlin, DE
Description: 
	The architecture of your system is tightly coupled to both the processes you use and the structure of your organization. When the three are not aligned, the work takes longer, costs more, and the odds of out-and-out failure are much higher. You see this problem particularly in organizations transitioning to holistic approaches like Agile.
Allen Holub details how these three interact and how to fix the misalignment thatâ€™s sucking the life out of your productivity.

what agile really does is let us build

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,899
something that's higher quality by using

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,000
and inspect and adapt to loop and that's

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,670
really at the core of everything that

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,799
agile is if we're doing this we're

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,289
working in an agile way if we're not

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,050
doing this we're not it's got nothing to

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,779
do with stand-up meetings so inspect and

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,779
adapt is a simple process is you make a

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,189
small change you deliver it you look at

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,109
what you've done you've assessed it and

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,480
then you improve it and this applies

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,669
across the board to the organization to

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,920
the software to the processes that you

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,149
use to every one of those five heads

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,430
that we were talking about I was talking

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,360
about a moment ago so the focus on speed

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,579
makes you think in the wrong direction

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,640
unless you think about how speed

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,760
actually does matter and what matters is

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,780
the speed at which you can get feedback

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,410
that's the point is to get feedback

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,539
quickly so anything that we do that gets

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,960
in the way of getting feedback quickly

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,180
is working against us what matters in

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,060
other words is the speed at which we can

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,520
learn not the speed with which we push

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,570
software out if we put software out and

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,570
it doesn't work but we've learned

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,360
something we have accomplished something

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,740
so we can't focus on output many many

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,869
many organizations are focusing

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,590
constantly on output so focus on

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:25,049
velocity focus on getting stuff done the

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,479
whole idea of twice the work well the

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,890
fact is that producing twice the garbage

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,710
and half the time doesn't buy us

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,100
anything what we need to do is produce

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,310
stuff that people find valuable so

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,280
instead of focusing on output we need to

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,229
be focusing on outcome is that how good

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,490
a result are we delivering for the

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,610
people that are in front of us that

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,409
they're our customers and we can't do

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,329
that unless we're thinking about getting

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,119
feedback from them and giving them what

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,299
they actually need so our focus has got

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,210
to be on value on delivering value not

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,369
just on delivering stuff and of course

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,149
if you're not delivering you're not

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,039
succeeding so value matters we need to

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,929
deliver value and the speed at which we

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,459
deliver it doesn't matter too much

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,230
though it matters a little bit of course

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,569
you have to be delivering as fast as the

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,459
market

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,829
requires you to deliver obviously or you

00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,950
haven't accomplished things but our goal

00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:23,400
here is to get feedback quickly so that

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,400
