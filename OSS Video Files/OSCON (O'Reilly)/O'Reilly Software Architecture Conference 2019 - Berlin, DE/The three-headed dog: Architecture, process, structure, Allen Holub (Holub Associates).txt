Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2019 - Berlin, DE
Description: 
	The architecture of your system is tightly coupled to both the processes you use and the structure of your organization. When the three are not aligned, the work takes longer, costs more, and the odds of out-and-out failure are much higher. You see this problem particularly in organizations transitioning to holistic approaches like Agile.
Allen Holub details how these three interact and how to fix the misalignment thatâ€™s sucking the life out of your productivity.
