hi Roger here with Roland share from

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,790
from AXA welcome welcome so we see that

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,330
you're the head of AXA revenue or Rev

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,920
it's what is that so ref is actually the

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,230
department at AXA that is responsible

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,600
for data and emerging technologies so

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,939
Rev Wallis the English word for speeding

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,189
up and the French word almost a French

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,170
word for the dream so it fits quite well

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,990
and it's a Norwegian word for the clever

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,269
Fox so we selected a word that is not

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,619
covered with any agency data lab

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,820
something like that because we had that

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,890
but before we go in another direction

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,070
that's great to use a lot of like kind

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,260
of semantic analysis to pick a word with

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,489
multi-dimensional meaning so

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,280
multi-dimensional brings of data which

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,410
is often a multi-dimensional insurance

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,440
is one of the places where in a way data

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,050
started because actuarial tables and

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,809
math being applied to a business what

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,219
makes a data driven company now yes so

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,629
tricky when I look at insurance it

00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,910
consists Mahler's of people

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,850
relationships data money and

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,860
mathematical models so being nowadays a

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,600
data-driven company is very very

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,850
important in the insurance industry in

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,530
general in those for our company the

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,330
tricky part is we're coming from a

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,850
legacy it's not that easy to convince

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,560
people to be really data-driven do we

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,810
really understand data as an asset and

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,580
you have to cope with that kind of

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,900
multi-dimensional problem because you

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,400
have to have people to understand in the

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,840
end the data right you have to have the

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,729
proper architectures you have the proper

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,310
governance data privacy data security

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,780
and coping that run with all these

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,090
different dimensions this is the trick

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,470
of being immediate data driven company

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,939
yeah so do you have do you have any

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,020
tricks for trying to get people on board

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,990
so what you start is with a

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,930
collaborative experience if you do data

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,149
just in the basement with the databases

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,159
it's simply not enough because honestly

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,720
data happens everywhere if you are a

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,369
claims handler if you are in the call

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,770
center if you're out there in a sales

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,299
agency everybody is actually treating

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,460
data and you have to understand the

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,740
holistic concept around data you have to

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,520
convince this the top level sponsors up

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,020
to the even the the the guy at the entry

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,110
door that is important to treat data

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,970
well and to get there so what we do is

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,240
of course driving first of all the

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,550
cultural change around

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,170
and then gradually coming into data

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,250
architectures data tools and so on and

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,720
so forth

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,770
I was curious if you see that there's a

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,930
fundamental problem of people

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,780
understanding it I think people don't

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,310
understand probability very well and I'm

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,010
just wondering what you think in terms

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,450
of getting data look at that by in

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,340
insurance industry are used to

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,960
probabilities you also be used to rare

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,980
events this is known as the insurance

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,330
risk it is a rare event by itself so on

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,350
the one side we have extras that are

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,750
very much

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,190
understand what probabilities are manage

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,450
risk many things right but when you go

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,150
to the business side and driving

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,770
strategic decisions of course there's an

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,910
overestimation and underestimation of

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,500
events and going forward in the

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,170
direction of course that is a tricky

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,490
part in our industry right yeah one of

00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,680
things too with data and I think it's

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,300
headed well on that it's in the basement

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,100
it's hard to do how do you bring in a

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,440
human element to the so on the one side

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,210
when it comes to the data assembly line

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,700
you bring the human element in by

00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,170
actually giving everybody that I'm

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,450
saying why this data is important to

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,610
small as codified knowledge what we have

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,170
around our businesses around our clients

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,180
or things and the ecosystems we are

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,040
driving but on the other side the human

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,110
element is especially when it comes to

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,060
how we use the data when it comes to

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,470
having strong ethical boundaries having

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,020
strong understanding on fairness

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,750
fairness biases and one swath and this

00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,150
is a tricky part because what means fair

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:43,240
in an insurance space everybody

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,440
understands treating a religion or skin

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,570
color the right

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,250
this is treatments clearly I didn't

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,500
identify this unfair but if you have

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,810
something like gender or age in a health

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,430
insurance is it no fair or unfair that

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,800
people that join the insurance company

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,510
later paying more cuz they actually

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,360
there's an higher risk of the disease or

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,790
is it already unfair so it's a very very

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,310
complex concept and we are taking that

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,430
one very seriously and also foster this

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,630
public debate on what is the human

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:17,260
element of data okay so in terms of like

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,480
what AXA does we're here at a conference

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,549
that's covering architecture and so

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,560
forth how does that relate to how you

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,270
deliver what you're trying to do so

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,440
first of all we having a belief in open

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,380
source and open standards

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,060
so one big reason why we're here as an

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,980
insurance company the tech conference is

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,590
that we want to share our knowledge and

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,410
our understanding and our our ideas with

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,060
the public bringing that one to the to

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,350
the people that actually doing software

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,500
in other companies in other industries

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,350
usually we work with starting with the

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,060
TOGAF group on open standards publishing

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,880
that one contributing to open source

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,470
projects funding open source projects

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,610
going out there and sharing this

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,320
knowledge cause we believe it's a

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,610
collaborative experience it doesn't make

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,200
sense that we hide that kind of

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,000
information because it has to go out

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,440
there and it has to go also in the

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,750
companies we work with record any cost

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,010
if any from these values I also think

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,780
there's a common phrase that all

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,660
companies are technology companies now

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,990
and you're kind of describing that kind

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,040
of scenario how do you kind of relate to

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,860
the kind of technology industry at large

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,470
mention open source do you I mean do you

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,170
try to work with folks like that are

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:30,460
more in the software realm yes and so

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:32,500
what we do if software companies follow

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,680
the same values fostering open standards

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,880
for ethical understanding we are happy

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,740
to work with and we do that we're

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,930
working together very hand-in-hand with

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,820
Amazon Microsoft Google to drive things

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,000
forward drive sanctorum open and

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,800
transparent manner it's part of the game

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,560
nevertheless we are a company that of

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,590
course our business related so every

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,510
discussion around IP intellectual

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,740
property and how things are treated for

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,810
us a little bit artificial because we

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,340
are interested in let's do it open let's

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,440
drive adoption on certain standards

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,210
instead of actually having IP discussion

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,710
on that one because we want to see an

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,320
adoption industry looking at health

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,990
insurance just as an example I'm health

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,700
insurance in general it's a it's

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,960
broadening its scope in the past was

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,690
like yes there was a health insurance

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,640
nowadays it's an healthcare ecosystem so

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,320
what you want to foster is open standard

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,730
and open exchange of information between

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,700
the players and the healthcare industry

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:28,240
to allow better services for the clients

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,680
to allow more digitalization around more

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,410
efficiency or on the product for the

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,760
sake of a client and of course there's a

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,280
win-win behind that one could be getting

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,510
more efficiency on the way we operate

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,800
and the client gets more a better

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,599
outcome around by using data and just

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,180
session in the proper way and this is

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,669
what we have to influence other ones too

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,509
to see it in the same manner and going

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:49,069
forward this what we hear in the

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,110
conference yeah I think that health care

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:54,500
too is one of the most murky of areas

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,909
because it's so private it is a very

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,889
tricky one especially when you talk

00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:00,620
publicly about health care and health

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,289
care data it's for a lot of people are

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,539
very uncomfortable topic to talk about

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,909
but honestly looking at the healthcare

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:10,879
industry in the u.s. in Europe it's

00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:13,009
largely paper-based it's still people

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,389
throwing paper balls at each other this

00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,750
is how it is between hospitals

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:19,039
insurances doctors GPS farmers and one

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,220
thing we haven't believed in there is a

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,830
better way to do that one with having

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,569
the client empowered the active consent

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,370
meant easy example active consent

00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,289
management having the data lineage from

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,080
end to end really from collecting the

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,690
data up to using the data and having the

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,240
client in power to allow them actively

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,710

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,080

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,569
purpose these things are not fixed in

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,400

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,560
that this is an area where we have to

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,780
have more innovation to drive things

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,370

technology to get things done so I

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,310
