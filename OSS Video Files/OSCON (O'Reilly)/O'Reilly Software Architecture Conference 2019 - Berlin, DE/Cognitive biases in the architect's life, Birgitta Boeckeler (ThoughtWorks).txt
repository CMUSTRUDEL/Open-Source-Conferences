Title: Cognitive biases in the architect's life, Birgitta Boeckeler (ThoughtWorks)
Publication date: 2019-11-07
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2019 - Berlin, DE
Description: 
	At the time of writing this, Wikipedia’s “Cognitive bias codex” has more than 200 entries, and it feels to me like Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking Fast and Slow” is referenced in every other conference talk I’m watching. It’s official: Human beings are just not the rational thinkers we like to think we are.
In this talk, I will go through just a few of the cognitive biases that can trip us up as architects, and how to soften their potentially negative impact.
