Title: A Strategy for the Journey to AI (sponsored by IBM) - Dinesh Nirmal (IBM)
Publication date: 2019-03-28
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - San Francisco, California
Description: 
	The journey to AI begins with data, and thereâ€™s no shortage of it. In fact, anyone can collect it; the goal now is to make intelligent use of it. To do this at enterprise-scale means building a new reality for your organization. Dinesh Nirmal, IBM VP of Development for Data and AI, shares a strategic framework for streamlining your data assets, a framework that takes into account the current state of your existing data structures, the new technologies driving enterprise, the complexities of business processes, and at the foundation, the elements required in an AI-fluent data platform.

	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,690
there's no doubt that AI is the hardest

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:11,250
topic in the industry right now from

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:14,759
self-driving cars to you know whether it

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,690
is the home assistance it's all talk

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,000
about AI I even recently read that home

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,730
assistance will be able to take care of

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,010
babies in a few years I told my wife you

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,039
should have another baby

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:33,030
we call it the AI baby she hasn't gone

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,680
for it but we also know that a is far

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,860
from that level of sophistication and

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,129
intelligence that we want to but we also

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,640
know that every enterprise have to adopt

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:48,870
AI to succeed and survive

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,780
I said three reasons one opportunities a

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:56,670
AI brings a set of opportunities that

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:59,309
did not exist before to optimization it

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,980
helps you optimize whether it's your

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,030
internal development process or your

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,409
supply chain three knowledge think about

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,140
it

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,700
if you are a bank and you had a lead

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,960
underwriter who has been there for

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,229
twenty or thirty years he or she leaves

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,360
the knowledge is gone with AI the

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,150
knowledge stays within enterprise so

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,250
it's so critical for every enterprise to

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:33,689
adopt AI but the reality is that you

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:37,500
know only 4% of executive admit that

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,509
they have really implemented AI it's not

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,159
easy because unless you're an enterprise

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,390
that was born in the last five years

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:49,340
which is very rare it's hard because you

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,500
have what I call the burden of legacy

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,360
there are data silos you know data

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,210
exists everywhere there's no shortage of

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,610
data there's dispersion of skills

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,369
this data is signed this there's data

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,640
engineers there's data stewards all

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,640
exist within there's architecture that

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,069
has been placed for a very long time so

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,180
and we did a case study with one of the

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,219
large customers financial customers

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,519
and we found exactly that the same

00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:20,170
problem exists in enterprises so I call

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,969
it how do you get to the journey for AI

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:28,000
I call it the cat the culture the

00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:29,920
culture has to come from bottoms up the

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,560
developers have to buy into that culture

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,389
that you have it has to be a decision

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,000
culture you have to have center of

00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:39,579
excellence to develop skills data

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,560
architecture you got to make sure you

00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:43,659
have a data architecture that's elastic

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,519
and expansive kubernetes gives some

00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:48,430
level of it but you need a data layer on

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,230
top of it you want real-time if you look

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,959
at it most of the data happens in

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,639
real-time but the decisions are made on

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,939
stale data how do you make real-time

00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,730
decisions on real-time data democratic

00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:03,489
yet governed how do you do that last but

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,219
not least technology that becomes a

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:08,829
critical pillar you don't want to take

00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,239
thousands of shiny objects or 20

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,030
different products bring it all together

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,219
you want a single data platform that can

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,269
give you that's built on top of open

00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:20,859
source so in IBM we built IBM cloud

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:24,099
pipes for data whether you are

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:27,010
collecting the data streaming data IOT

00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,109
data or connecting that's what I mean by

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,150
data virtualization be able to connect

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,459
to existing data source without moving

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,819
your data being able to organize your

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,370
data govern your data manage your data

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:43,720
cleanse your data and then build models

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:46,329
on that data so analyze and then finally

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,400
infuse how do you infuse that model that

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,709
you built into your existing

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,509
architecture or enterprise that is the

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,729
biggest struggle that enterprises have

00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:57,280
that I have seen is that building the

00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:59,709
model itself only takes weeks but

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,479
infusing their model or interjecting the

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,250
model into your existing enterprise

00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,280
that's the biggest challenge every

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,019
enterprise faces so I took like three

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,790
case studies or three customers that we

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:13,659
have worked with from hundreds of

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:17,440
customers one healthcare how do you take

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:19,509
vitals from a patient real time and be

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,370
able to make decisions for that patient

00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:24,930
on that data which is very critical

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,180
which is happening today to finance

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,699
zkp you know the security becomes so

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,550
critical today for customers how do we

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,850
use you know protocols like zkp to do

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,190
gdpr and make data more secure three

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,620
manufacturing how can you do predictive

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,340
maintenance on large sets of data and

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,650
improve your supply chain process so if

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,889
you want to learn more about journey to

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,449
AI stop by our booth 10 15 and would

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,490
love to talk about you know how do you

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:57,440
modernize your data States and take you

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,440
to the journey of air thank you so much

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,699
