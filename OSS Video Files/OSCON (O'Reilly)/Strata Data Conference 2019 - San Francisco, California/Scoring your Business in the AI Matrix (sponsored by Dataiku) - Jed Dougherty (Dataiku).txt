Title: Scoring your Business in the AI Matrix (sponsored by Dataiku) - Jed Dougherty (Dataiku)
Publication date: 2019-03-28
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - San Francisco, California
Description: 
	AI is certainly a hot topic that everyone claims to be doing (or working on doing). But how many businesses are actually executing? One of the reasons it’s a difficult question to answer is that everyone seems to have a different definition of what exactly AI is.

One of the more common and fairly widely accepted definitions is that AI means going beyond simple statistics to mimic human skills in perception, learning, interaction, and decision making. But even this definition leaves some room for interpretation. So going one step further, we’ll check out some examples on a matrix that breaks down the different parts of that definition and how they might manifest themselves in data science projects at different levels.

hi everyone I'm Jed dirty they date a

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,270
scientist with a tie ku today I'm here

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,730
to talk to you about scoring your

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,650
business in the AI matrix AI is

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,380
certainly a hot topic everyone claims to

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,730
be doing or working on doing but how

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,500
many businesses are actually executing

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,960
one of the reasons is difficult to

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,430
question to answer that everyone seems

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,300
to have a different definition of what

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,250
exactly a is but before we dive in to

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,949
the matrix we're gonna look at a recent

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,610
history of hype in AI and data science a

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,660
little bit personalized here as well

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,239
everybody loves Google Trends everybody

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,870
loves data in this room I hope this is a

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,420
Google trend chart of data science and

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,260
artificial intelligence since around

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,620
2004 we can see start off here with a

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,329
long a I winter coming from late 80s

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,079
when everybody got scared about AI last

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,899
time right around here 2010 I first hear

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,120
the term data science Hilary Mason data

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,320
scientist came up to me at a hacker

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,240
collective in Brooklyn and gave me her

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,670
card knows what is data science 2012

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,020
2011 first data science graduate degrees

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,460
start to appear hey I still flat Alexus

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,500
released in 2015

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,240
shortly after that we start to see this

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,280
uptick in AI interest that's going up

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,000
much faster even the data science and

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,520
finally right now massive spike is that

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,710
the singularity probably not it's a high

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,759
pocket but that's ok we can ride that

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,159
high pocket interest in AI is exploding

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,790
in a way that even interest in data

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,640
science never has how do we define AI

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,979
though back in 1964 Supreme Court

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,659
justice Potter Stewart said I should not

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,130
today attempt to further define the

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,649
kinds of material I understand to be

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,390
embraced within AI and perhaps I could

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,320
never succeed in intelligibly doing so

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,469
but I know it when I see it ok he

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,170
actually said this about pornography but

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:03,380
it's not that big of a difference Turing

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,390
test is a very similar concept to this

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,099
unlike Supreme Court justices we can't

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,170
afford to be all wobbly touchy-feely in

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,989
our definitions we need a rubric to

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,950
define a project's AI score so we can

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,319
decide if we're actually do

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,620
it or not why would we need to do this

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,519
they should do two things

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,500
we should define where the current

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,190
projects a line that we're working on

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,379
right now a line with true AI and two we

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,819
should help an organization decide this

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,200
score should help an organization decide

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:36,599
whether they even need to be aiming for

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:41,010
true AI happily my CEO Florian Duetto

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,810
has created an AI score this AI score is

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,879
based on four different categories and

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,190
goes from 0 to 2 might be a little hard

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,569
to read you can look it up on his blog

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,140
Florian do I don't find it pops right up

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,489
we have perception we have learning

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,680
interaction and complex decision-making

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,780
each of these can be scored on a zero to

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,700
two rubric so for example with

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,519
perception something that just reads in

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,700
flat data files and make some type of

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,380
simple judgment on top of those would be

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,680
a zero of two whereas something that

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,510
takes in video or audio data and it's

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,380
able to process that would be a two of

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,510
two for learning we can have something

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,100
based just on static rules going all the

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,290
way up to something that's constantly

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,959
reteaching itself how to learn or read

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,459
teaching itself a model interaction no

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,959
in our direct interaction with humans

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,549
all the way to interacting in a

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,190
conversational manner and finally

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,049
complex decision-making refighting just

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,450
simple decisions all the way up to

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,670
combining underlying models in multiple

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,299
ways optimization systems in order to

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,799
build advanced strategies it's kind of

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,959
easier to think about an AI score if we

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,180
look at some examples first example I'd

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,769
like to think about of course is data

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,519
I'm referring to Lieutenant Commander

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,540
data he is a second officer on the

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,720
Starship Enterprise

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,190
and he is a wonderful exemplification of

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,109
something that scores a two in all four

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,500
categories of course unfortunately also

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,849
exists only the 23rd century Alexa is

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,680
maybe something there are a little more

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,989
familiar about we could think of Alexa

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,620
scoring a 1 right in the middle in all

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:17,510
four categories below Alexa hot tub not

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,709
hot dog from Silicon Valley

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,690
it looks at hotdogs it tells you whether

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,860
it's a hot dog or not and maybe below

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,410
that predictive maintenance I don't say

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,490
this to de minuit predictive maintenance

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,800
predictive maintenance is a massive

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,680
wonderful topic that I worked on this

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,150
year I also worked a helping build a CRM

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,410
company capture a recommendation engine

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,750
that pushed out with thousands of API

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,280
endpoints I helped a large bank give a

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,480
several hundred person team of analysts

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,669
point click access to their multi

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,740
petabyte Hadoop cluster all of these

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:51,930
things would be a 0 or a 1 on the AI

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,190
score the moral of the story here is

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,750
that both data science and AI are

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,250
fledgling industries and there's still

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,840
huge business gains to be made from

00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,669
technologies and techniques that are

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,620
very far from what we might consider AI

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,080
where we're using the realistic AI score

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,400
like Florian's and that's okay companies

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,540
are putting products and techniques into

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,430
place every day that have a score of

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,540
zero to two and the AI score and profit

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,270
in quite nicely from these

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,860
implementations build your foundation

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,820
then decide whether and how your company

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,919
would benefit from the types of

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,630
technologies that register high AI score

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,590
before climbing into that hyper rocket

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,590
thank you

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,880
