Most enterprises want the same flexibility and convenience they get in the public cloud, no matter where their data lives or their applications run. We've reached the point that the "enterprise data cloud" must span the firewall and the services offered by hyperscale vendors. Mike Olson describes the key capabilities that such a system requires and why hybrid and multi-cloud is the future.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,270
we've learned a great deal in the last

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,219
ten or eleven years from the way that

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,830
people collect analyze and use data

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:15,929
one of the signature transformations in

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,109
the industry has been the dramatic

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,449
success of powerful cloud platforms you

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,180
heard about the great work that Google

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,010
is doing in augmenting extending the

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,849
capabilities of the data warehouse and

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,769
and and the critical importance of

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:35,790
streaming data analytics over time I'm a

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:39,059
huge believer we've all seen Amazon and

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,969
Microsoft Azure deliver powerful new

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,649
services to enterprises quite broadly in

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,989
our installed base and the large

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,420
enterprises we talk to commercial and

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,300
government the cloud isn't going to

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,590
happen the cloud has happened but what's

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,020
interesting is that it's not one cloud

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,219
it's not even true that the data center

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,050
is dead at least in the large

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,690
enterprises banks hospitals insurance

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,630
companies that we talk to virtually

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,750
everyone continues to operate a data

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,750
center of their own now what they'd

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,140
really like to do is to have one

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,420
consistent picture of their data

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,159
regardless of where it happens to live

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,479
it may be on Amazon it may be in Google

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,409
it may be in their own data center

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,630
they'd like to set in force monitor

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,549
security policies and data governance

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,930
policies in order to be sure that

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,280
they're doing the right thing with the

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,680
data that they're complying with the

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,840
general data protection regulation for

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,170
example in Europe a law that I believe

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,909
will be reflected by legislation not

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,939
just in California but across the u.s.

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,820
and the next couple of years we will see

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:52,049
data privacy evolve is a critical

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,060
requirement globally and that means that

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,439
anybody storing data no matter where

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,329
they're storing it is going to know that

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,369
it is gonna have to know that it is

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,939
secure so you want to be able to spread

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,189
your data among those places and then

00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:08,550
you want to be able not just a sequel

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,790
that data not just to text search that

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,870
data not just to train machine learning

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,840
models and deploy those models although

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,330
out to the edge on that data you want to

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,720
do all that stuff you'd like a

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,610
full-featured collection of analytic

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,500
services that are able to work with that

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,890
data at massive scale regardless of its

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,440
home in order to do that you need

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,319
consistent security governance you need

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,340
one view of policy that applies to that

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,730
data across the spectrum and oh hey by

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,890
the way it's not just that the cloud is

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,440
good because it saves me the trouble of

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,319
back and trucks up to my loading dock

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,560
the main lesson that we've learned from

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,660
the cloud is that easy

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,670
seriously matters these systems have to

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,489
spin up and spin down on demand end

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,620
users need to be able to self-service

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,540
their way to sequel or the machine

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,450
learning or the tech search or to the

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,659
other analytic frameworks that they run

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,810
they want everywhere the convenience

00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:16,359
that they get from the public cloud in

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:21,630
particular they want in their data

00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:21,630
centers public cloud style services

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,780
