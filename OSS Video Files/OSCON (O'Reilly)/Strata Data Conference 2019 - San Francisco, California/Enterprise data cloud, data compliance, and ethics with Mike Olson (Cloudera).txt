	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,920
hi my name is Paco Nathan and I'm here

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,960
with a Reilly media we're at the strata

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,030
data conference and today it's a

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,460
pleasure to be joined with Michaelson

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,280
who is chief strategy officer for cloud

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,690
era great to see Mike thank you we've

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,680
been doing this together for a bunch of

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,160
years and it's great to see you again

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,869
this year

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,699
wonderful I'm really looking forward to

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,710
this show it's much bigger venue and a

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,420
lot of really exciting content here yeah

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,740
I think so I think so the agenda looks

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,990
fantastic

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,019
well the first question now combined

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,120
with Hortonworks Clara's mission is to

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,239
offer the industry's first enterprise

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,040
data cloud what exactly is that can you

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,210
describe that a bit more for us yeah let

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,980
me talk about the transformation that

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,050
we're seeing in the industry and what's

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,940
behind that message and then I want to

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,739
talk a little bit as well about why the

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,340
two companies together and now a single

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,039
bigger company are able to pursue we've

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,620
learned from the dramatic and

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,590
magnificent success of the public cloud

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,370
vendors over the past decade that large

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,229
enterprise users want ease-of-use they

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,970
want self-service they want to be able

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,650
to spin up workloads on demand they want

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,549
all the flexibility that public cloud

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,740
offers most of our customers are still

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,320
running really substantial data centers

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,970
of their own and what they'd like is all

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,180
of that convenience and simplicity and

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,400
self-service at home as well as on the

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,650
public cloud so the first thing that we

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,159
need to do as an industry that we want

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,920
to do as a company is deliver the public

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,470
cloud experience on owned Hardware real

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,150
private cloud turns out that's been a

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,460
goal for a long time but with the advent

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,670
of docker for containerization of

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,710
kubernetes for orchestration we're newly

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,530
able to do that separate storage from

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,770
compute and let people spin workloads up

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,799
and spin them down that means same apps

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,780
run at home and in the public cloud but

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,159
there's a second part of enterprise data

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,280
cloud that matters and that is the

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,930
enterprise part it's not enough merely

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,920
to be able to run your workloads where

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,619
you like you need to be able to secure

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,670
manage govern the data that you've got

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,580
you've got to be able to live up to

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,140
regulatory requirements and you really

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,210
want a picture of your data

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,680
across that fabric some is going to be

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,210
living in the public cloud some will be

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,920
running in your own data center some may

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,590
be on a managed service provider you'd

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,730
like a single pane of glass a dashboard

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,310
that lets you set enforce security

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,890
policies and then monitor their

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,600
application consistently and that's

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,220
really the second part of our enterprise

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,980
data cloud offering I'm convinced that a

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,320
rich suite of analytic services machine

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,870
learning and sequel and text search and

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,360
data prep and analytics combined with

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,970
that security layer running in a hybrid

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,640
and multi cloud environment is exactly

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,650
what the enterprise needs and I'm

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,140
convinced that now the much larger cloud

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,150
era the new cloud era combining the

00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,500
Hortonworks product line in people with

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,310
the clutter of product line and people

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,540
is in a fantastic position deliver to

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,660
deliver that to the market we've got a

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,030
much larger product line now and we've

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,310
got a much bigger team able to build and

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,710
innovate faster than ever before

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,090
fantastic thank you so yeah I hear this

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,370
and there there were point solutions

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,260
before data governance or docker or

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,510
however but now getting that fabric

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,220
together that integration is is very

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,440
crucial for what needs to go forward

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,540
yeah we certainly think so and look I

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,209
mean I'm an old guard relational

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,050
database guide myself there is an

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:36,480
essential role for sequel for data query

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,820
and exploration of the enterprise but

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,000
what we're learning is that sequel as a

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:45,750
point solution is insufficient I want to

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,190
be able to ingest ETL prep all my data

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,940
and then I want to be able to query it

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,620
but hey then I want to train some models

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,989
on that data as well I want to fire up

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,120
150 notes a spark using tensorflow or

00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,550
something else in order to discover an

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,870
patterns in that data and I don't want

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,180
to have to make copies of the data I

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,190
don't want to move it from silo a to

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,010
silo B because those silos have

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,230
different user identity models and

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,700
different security frameworks and if I'm

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,169
an enterprise CIO I have to worry about

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,299
living up to my regulatory obligations

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,760
across that if I can have a single

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,160
fabric framework that allows me to do

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,030
that I'll be able to set the policy once

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,350
to use all the analytic tools I want

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,080
and to guarantee that I've got the

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,810
security that I require right fantastic

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,400
now you're talking about some of the

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,210
issues of compliance coming in here as

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,000
organizations across board become

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,460
increasingly more data-driven how can

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,860
business leaders ensure that they have

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,260
the data compliance in order they have

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,370
it coming along the way the essential

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,830
capability is securing your data setting

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,660
the policies and applying them the cloud

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,810
era enterprise data cloud offering our

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,270
cloud era data platform includes a

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,400
central capability the shared data

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:09,320
experience that allows administrators

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:13,040
and data policy folks to see what data

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,650
they've got to assign access and revoke

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,620
access to individual users groups by

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,660
role or by identity and then to monitor

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,400
that compliance over time and that is

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,300
regardless of whether it's in the public

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,840
cloud or on Prem

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,210
or how it may move among those so those

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,160
capabilities are essential and I'll make

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,890
the point that those capabilities are

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,590
absolutely critical for a big enterprise

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,590
so the general data protection

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,150
regulation gdpr is now in effect in

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,510
Europe and what that means is every

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,640
global organization has to apply it and

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,530
most are trying to apply it not just for

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,850
their European clients how do you

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,160
guarantee that the guys are European

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,140
right they're required to do it more

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,750
globally I think in the next year or two

00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,669
we're gonna see meaningful privacy

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,860
legislation emerge in the United States

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,050
as well I very much hope it's consistent

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,750
with the gdpr and Europe I'd like a

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,910
common framework across all but I think

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,950
that this security compliance and and

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,919
privacy requirement is going to become

00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,039
even more critical in the coming years

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,830
excellent

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,450
now what role does ethics play I know

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,710
that this is a driver for a lot of what

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,960
we're talking about with compliance but

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,729
what role does ethics play for data

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,300
driven for this kind of movement of

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:29,060
companies it's very good question so

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,130
underlying the GDP are the general data

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,410
protection regulation was an ethical

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,990
concern for individual control over

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,370
their data more generally though I think

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,010
enterprises

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,310
need to and they're beginning to yeah

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:46,130
ask not just what can we do with this

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,440
data but what should we do if you go

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,030
back a few years you know I've had

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,030
conversations in venues and

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,979
conversations like this one before about

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,630
the don't be creepy rule right we don't

00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:00,590
want to do things that surprise or alarm

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,600
users as we collect more data it becomes

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,530
easier to be creepy I think it's

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,820
important for organizations to

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,139
understand first of all what's the

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,389
business reason for collecting this data

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,240
what questions we're gonna ask how long

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,770
do we need to keep it right there will

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,650
be a time when we've got the answers to

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,840
those questions and at that point I

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,250
think it's important for organizations

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,320
to get rid of data that they no longer

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,990
require you hear about all of these very

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,570
big data breaches in my view sometimes

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,669
it's just laziness organizations collect

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,380
data they fail to delete it and it

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,570
becomes a very attractive target for

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,060
hackers or others to break in so look I

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:41,389
think we in the industry need to drive

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,060
this ethical conversation it's likely to

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,740
be enforced by legislation as well but

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,110
the longer we wait the worse it's gonna

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,150
get right now there's legislation coming

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,280
even in California there's something

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,680
that's it's similar to GDP GDP our isn't

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,300
it indeed so California Massachusetts a

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,570
few of the other states here in the US

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:03,470
are in the vanguard in consumer privacy

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:05,710
laws applying the data I'm glad to see

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:09,139
that I really do think that we want a

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,710
governmental and society wide approach

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,750
to data privacy I will say that I would

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,419
prefer that there was a single framework

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,180
across the United States rather than a

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,580
whole bunch of individual state regs

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,770
that were more or less consistent with

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,280
one another or inconsistent with GDP are

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,260
right one of the questions last year it

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,169
was a big one for open-source for the

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,060
community aspects of open-source

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,700
Cloudera obviously is a pioneer and open

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:41,750
source so what what you see coming up

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,250
next and where is this going I think

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,579
that we're going to see the pace of

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:49,760
innovation continue even accelerate open

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:50,580
source is clearly the way for

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,330
communities

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:57,600
to collaborate to create powerful new

00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:00,330
software services and models and you've

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,430
seen a huge number of really impactful

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,709
projects emerge I mean the Hadoop

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,839
project is now like 12 years old 2006

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,459
was its first

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,350
production deployment spark emerged

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:15,600
maybe seven years ago now right and

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,579
we've seen a whole bunch of data in just

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,339
Apache knife I for example projects

00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,980
emerge so in the data space we're gonna

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:26,010
see continued evolution of these

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,089
services I also think we're gonna see

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:32,279
creative new ways to apply those to

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,820
business problems you've seen a lot of

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,980
innovation in licensing these days more

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,899
or less open more or less coercive

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,800
licenses I think that story's a little

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,829
bit overblown

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,910
I think the ecosystem as a whole public

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,649
cloud providers like Amazon and

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,329
Microsoft are actually great

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:50,970
contributors to the open-source

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:54,480
ecosystem there are many companies

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,010
clutter among them with a financial

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,140
stake in open source and we're gonna

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,810
find ways to monetize what we do just as

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,500
Amazon and Microsoft and by the way IBM

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:07,920
and Oracle and startups do but I think

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,839
the fact that open source is such a rich

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,180
way to collaborate with one another

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,790
means we're gonna see that movement

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,500
accelerate in the coming years and the

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,570
community aspect of it the collaboration

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,760
this is the vendors it's also

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,190
individuals developers but but it's also

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,630
the the teams from enterprise from the

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,750
customer side they're in go oh that's

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,880
absolutely right I mean look CIO is love

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,440
open-source for a bunch of reasons one

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,700
is you know they don't have to worry

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,020
about being locked into a single vendor

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,190
they've got all the code themselves they

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,000
can self support they could find another

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:42,570
vendor a really critical advantage

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,779
though is that the technical folks in

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,279
the enterprise can see all the way down

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,810
to the metal they can look at the code

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,329
they know what the api's are they know

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,180
how it operates they can innovate in the

00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,640
projects and they can innovate on top of

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,380
the projects as well

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,750
sharing source code lets people be more

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,180
creative faster and it unlocks a whole

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,930
bunch more innovation than black box

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,630
proprietary

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,920
software ever did fantastic thank you

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,279
very much like always good teickhoff

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,279
thank

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,779
