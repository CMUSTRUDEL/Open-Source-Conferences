	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,920
usually today when we talk about AI what

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,990
we're really talking about is machine

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,849
learning specifically a branch called

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,099
deep learning where neural nets are

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,410
trained to learn by example from large

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,410
data sets without being pre-programmed

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,359
with specific rules these techniques

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,449
have led to major breakthroughs and

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,150
historically hard AI problems like image

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,980
and speech recognition but they have not

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,539
worked for natural language

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,439
understanding and they are by no means

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,300
silver bullets for every AI problem

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,780
natural language understanding is still

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,640
far from being solved that's why Siri or

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,590
that annoying customer service chat bots

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,520
are still constantly apologizing I'm

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,050
sorry I didn't understand you now even

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,730
if you do have a data set that is

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,160
sufficiently labeled to train a machine

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,020
learning model or help make an educated

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,059
guess as to what people will say to your

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,390
chat bot you still need to script

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,879
responses conversation designer is

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,100
actually a hot new job category here in

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,680
Silicon Valley or what my out-of-work

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,240
journalist friend calls job security for

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,400
English majors now wait a second why

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,710
can't we just use an algorithm for

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,270
natural language generation which should

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,820
let the computer formulate a

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,610
theoretically extensible answer based on

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,509
what it learns the reason why we can't

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,180
do this is your fault people people as

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,280
it turns out Steve terrible things on

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,560
the internet and when chat box learned

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,409
from people's inputs unchecked they go

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,439
off the rails very quickly like poor

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,590
Microsoft Tay here which famously turned

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,780
into a Hitler loving sex robot within 24

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,630
hours of being fed on a diet of tweets

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,920
we're just lucky that she wasn't eating

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:53,009
reddit this taste equation honestly says

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,280
more about human nature than about

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,049
robots our biases creep into our data

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,570
sets and the biased software that's

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,710
created is actually a reflection of our

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,799
worst selves so in order to avoid

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,840
creating Hitler loving sex robots we're

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,020
stuck writing rules or hand authoring

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,060
bot responses to be brand appropriate

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,880
and anticipate everything anyone could

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,660
possibly say to a chatbot which feels

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,070
like an impossible problem however while

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,500
it's true that there are an infinite

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,900
number of possible combinations of words

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,880
the frequency at which words appear in

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,250
language actually obey something called

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,830
zips law which observed that the most

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,190
frequent word appears twice as often as

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,320
the second most frequent and so on what

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,960
we realized when we analyzed our data is

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,660
the same distribution curve holds true

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,310
not just for words but for phrases and

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:53,400
sentences in fact 95% of first input to

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,590
all chatbots are covered by just 1,800

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,890
words and the average branching factor

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:04,170
decreases with each successive word in

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:07,170
other words people are boring we walk

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:12,060
around saying the same thing most of the

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,950
time specifically these things which are

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,570
the top 50 inputs across all

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,780
english-speaking chat BOTS on our

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,060
platform Universal regardless of the use

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,540
case and they made me bleep some of them

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,820
out as you can see in fact because we

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,380
know the top 10,000 things that people

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,050
are likely to say in general

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,300
conversation we've open-sourced chitchat

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,570
libraries so developers don't need to

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,580
reinvent the wheel 10,000 is also the

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,950
magic number of responses or rules

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,460
required on average to cover a specific

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,590
domain which boils down to about 160

00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,790
hours of human labor or a month of work

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,790
prior to launch

00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,209
