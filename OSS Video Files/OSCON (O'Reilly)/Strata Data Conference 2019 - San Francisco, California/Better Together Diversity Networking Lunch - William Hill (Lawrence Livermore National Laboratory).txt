	00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:10,110
so this guy that's me

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:12,269
I'm will everybody so like Joel I am an

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,370
engineer and I've used the Joel test

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,170
before to evaluate a particular team

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,539
that are you know particularly now I was

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,769
interested in working for I really like

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:27,150
it but there's a pretty striking

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:32,880
difference between myself and Joel I'm

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:36,239
black so that tend to shape and inform

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,829
and change how I'm viewed and move

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,899
within the world versus someone like

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,940
Joel and the same can be said for other

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,680
members of underrepresented groups in in

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,989
communities in tech whether that be

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
women Latin eggs LGBT or people with

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,129
disabilities

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,390
so we're evaluating a tip different team

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,250
or company that we're interested in

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,920
working for we may have some additional

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,090
concerns that fall outside of the scope

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,879
of the Joel test that we have to

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:04,530
consider so I'm looking to fill that gap

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,799
today with the wheel test so the will

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,939
test is an analogue to the Joel test

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,530
design in the same manner there should

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,299
be you know completed within a couple

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,380
minutes and each one of the responses

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,799
should be answered with a yes or no

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,820
question and it's intended to evaluate

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,710
the culture and inclusivity of a team so

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,270
what we're gonna do today is walk

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,820
through each of these nine points fairly

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,409
quickly and our admittedly a lot of

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,689
these are highly personal highly

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,979
personal to me but also I mean it's

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,450
Australia it's a data conference so I

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,950
try to include a couple data points in

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,630
there so we're gonna talk through each

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,000
one of them and I actually encourage

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,619
everyone to even score your own company

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
as we're going through because once we

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,250
get to the end we're gonna actually look

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,680
at our grading rubric with some little

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,259
special surprises in there and and

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,619
before we go each one of these are kind

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,299
of like in sub blocks so we have some

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,040
some that are kind of evaluating company

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,350
structure we have some points that are

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,759
evaluating how conducive a company or

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,250
team is to maintaining your well-being

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,979
and then we're also looking at hiring

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,140
and retention practices so let's start

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,940
looking at the points so the first one

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,739
are there any minorities or management

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,330
in leadership so there's been a lot of

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,840
talk about increasing you know the

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,760
number

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,170
of minority engineers within various

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,360
companies but a lot of times the

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,819
conversation ends up focusing around you

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,340
know entry-level mid-career people but

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,440
looking at the higher levels of a

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,840
company an organization can also you

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,950
know be beneficial according to a report

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,769
from the center of and guest

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,940
investigative reporting in 2017 that

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:41,790
looked at the 177 largest tech companies

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:43,500
only 1.5 percent excuse me only the

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,739
people in management of those companies

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,010
only 1.5 percent was where black men and

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,239
only 0.9 percent were black women that's

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,560
at the management level but then if you

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,540
look a higher up at the executive level

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,700
there's a number fall even further where

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,890
it's only one percent black man and 0.4

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,860
percent black women so those numbers are

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,780
really dire and looking at those the

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,519
upper levels of those companies those

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,950
are the people who are in position to

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,959
help shape culture and shape the

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,989
inclusivity of a company so that's one

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,180
point that you can use as an evaluation

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,519
the next thing is our org charts and

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,380
titles clearly defined there are some

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,269
companies that favor more of a flat

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,459
organization more kind of ambiguous

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,160
titles which in itself is not inherently

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,069
bad but it can introduce ambiguity

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,019
ambiguity is rarely beneficial for

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,569
underrepresented communities because

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,239
anytime you have ambiguity it also

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,769
allows unconscious bias and outright

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,389
discrimination to creep into the process

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,400
the next point is the path to promotion

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,889
clearly defined similar to the last

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,930
point that we want to try to remove as

00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,209
much ambiguity as we can as possible

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,609
having well-defined responsibilities in

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,680
your current role as well as having

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,120
those defined responsibilities in the

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,790
next world on a career ladder whether

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,069
that's as I see or going into management

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,380
can help even the playing field and

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:09,120
remove politics from the promotion

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:11,849
process is there an internal mentorship

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,400
program so up here you know trying to be

00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,739
honest and forthright as I can be if

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,959
we're you know just looking at it and

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,840
being truthful a lot of people who are

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,969
in positions to be the most effective

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,879
and maybe the most beneficial managers

00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,310
or official mints

00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,500
or older white men the people who are

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,780
you know who can benefit the most from

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,419
that mentorship tend to look nothing

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,389
like them so there can be some you know

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:41,270
kind of barriers between more informal

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:44,120
relationships forming now true enough it

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,460
can feel a little stilted to have a more

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,830
formal program but it also reduces some

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,319
of those social political barriers that

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,889
prevent the relationships from forming

00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,150
in the first place

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,530
so that was kind of the company

00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,969
structure factors so now we're gonna

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,349
look at a couple points as far as

00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:01,940
maintaining your well-being within the

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,860
company and the first one is they're

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,620
clearer access to mental health

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,259
resources so there was a survey in 2016

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,180
by the blind app where it says 57% of

00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:12,620
engineers survey itself reported their

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,879
their that they were experiencing some

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,370
form of burnout

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,479
now burnout can happen to anyone but

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,349
from people from underrepresented

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,460
communities will you add in things like

00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:24,440
microaggressions and impostor syndrome

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,500
that tends to compound the effect

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,509
so having clearer access to mental sort

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,009
Mental Health Resources is becoming more

00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:33,279
and more vital when evaluating whether

00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:37,069
our company is good to work for

00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,919
is there an enforced code of conduct now

00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:41,599
enforced is the key word here because I

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,120
think most public companies you tend to

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,190
have you know a code of conduct but a

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,099
lot of times it can be very relaxed not

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,440
well defined not enforced so the thing

00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:54,500
is having well-defined acceptable

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,270
behaviors and deterministic consequences

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,940
when those behaviors and those rules are

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,150
broken can help create a more inclusive

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:06,710
environment we don't want any side

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,060
effects here so those work for the

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,529
points of trying to maintain your mental

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,440
health so now we want to look at a

00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:15,050
couple points with diversity hiring and

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,810
recruiting and retention so does the

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,330
team recruit through diverse channels so

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,129
a lot of times we hear about the

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,349
pipeline problem we've heard it you know

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,900
beat to death I tend to think it's a

00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:30,139
little bit overblown a lot of companies

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,719
like to recruit from certain schools and

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,710
that's fine and in most cases because I

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,180
mean a lot of those you know quote

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,719
unquote target schools tend to produce

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,500
you know high quality engineers but when

00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:41,570
they do that

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,990
and yet tout they can't find people from

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:47,060
you know diverse backgrounds then what

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,490
do they expect you can't catch fish in a

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,460
desert so you've got to expand your

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,550
scope so beyond just recruiting at HBCUs

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,250
or other colleges that you know may have

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,070
a larger pool of diverse candidates

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,740
there also other ways to source you know

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,350
the first talent job well in this case

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,930
is a online platform designed

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,520
specifically for this purpose and even

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,890
beyond that there are several annual

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,200
conferences just to you know name a few

00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,600
to tapia conference Grace Hopper today

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,030
SP conference an afro tech that annually

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,830
brings together thousands of Engineers

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,350
from diverse backgrounds who are lik

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,000
looking you know for new positions so if

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,500
you're not represented at any of those

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,020
places you've really not trying that

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:35,720
hard that's the company invest in career

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,430
growth so this is actually related to

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,900
the last point that recruiting the first

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,360
talent it's only half the battle

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,460
once you get it there you you know needs

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,080
to maintain and retain that that talent

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,720
because a lot of times we've seen

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,040
different companies try to you know put

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,260
together initiatives where they really

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,419
wanted to bring in more candidates yet

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,950
their numbers are not really moving

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,330
because as soon as they're bringing in

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,370
more candidates a lot of them are

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,800
leaving maybe pop you know potentially

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,940
due to poor culture so you you need to

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,460
make sure that you retain that talent

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,979
and one of the ways to do that is to

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,800
foster their career growth so whether

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,990
that's you know providing resources for

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,520
continuing education giving them

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,090
opportunity to speak at conferences or

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,790
what-have-you

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,650
allowing them to grow technically allows

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,140
them to matriculate up your company and

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,729
makes the employees feel value which

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,810
would then make them tend to stay longer

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:30,140
with your company and then lastly is

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,910
there a dedicated DNI team so I know

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,320
this isn't feasible for every single

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,580
companies you know maybe like smaller

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,750
startups this thing like that order

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,849
still growing may not have a dedicated

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:44,839
DNI DNI team but the problem with that

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:48,050
is that if the DNI efforts didn't fall

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,970
to the engineers themselves because at

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,100
that point you're kind of perpetuating

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,060
the problem even more than you know

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,650
what's already happening if

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,470
you're asking the engineers to go out

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,790
and promote DNI and not compensating

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,920
them for it that is the big thing

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,750
because then you're asking them to do

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,970
extra work on top of their already

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,500
initial responsibilities which is then

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,210
just perpetuating the cycle and any

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,850
problem they're already facing so those

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,200
were the nine points they said you know

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,089
one to go through just give a little bit

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,440
of information about each one of them so

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,630
I'll hope some people were keeping

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,670
scores so that we can kind of go through

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,339
this next part together because now we

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,779
have the wheel scale for scoring we're

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:35,240
gonna have a little help with this so if

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:40,700
you have zero points just know not just

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,680
just get in the car and leave if X cry

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,330
but one to three points you're probably

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:49,210
gonna end up like this at some point in

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:51,830
there talking to HR sad crying you know

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,550
yeah so that's probably how you're gonna

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,339
end up eventually

00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,940
four to six points okay thinking about

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:03,200
it why this might not be too awful we

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,880
might can thrive here

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,440
so we can we're thinking about it like

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,360
okay we're on the right track here seven

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,980
or eight points okay feel a little

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
better

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,770
dancing with groove it was like we might

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,680
get thrown grow and thrive here this is

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,410
might be a pretty good place for us but

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,420
what we really want to be is nine points

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,580
were you looking good you're feeling

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,820
good and hopefully getting pay good so

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,800
you want to be men in black wheel Smith

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,730
so anybody in here working at a place

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,820
that makes them feel like Men in Black

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,680
Will Smith okay we got one two

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:42,110
I've got a few so that means everybody

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,700
else we got some work to do so that was

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,950
my presentation I appreciate everyone

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,860
you know being here and providing me

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,160
their attention so that's all I have now

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:59,030
we can open up for discussion

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:59,030
[Applause]

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,840
that was a really good presentation

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,339
thank you and I have also kind of I'm a

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,080
front-end web developer and I've also

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,390
kind of come to similar conclusions as

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,310
you and I bouncing around a lot in

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,839
startups and just never been able to

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,250
make it work and startups even though

00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,680
it's where all the exciting stuff is

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,860
happening but based on your skill I'd

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,950
noticed that at 90% of startups the

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,960
first four of your criteria are just out

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,890
the window you know they're not there's

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,529
no structure there's no you know clear

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:39,610
ways to advance so I don't know what are

00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,870
your thoughts on startups so I guess I

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,540
should preface a lot of this by saying

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,390
that I'm not presenting a bunch of

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,529
solutions because if I was presenting

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,279
solutions and people should be paying me

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,600
for that so but just the the touch on

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,610
that question I understand what startups

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,110
things are moved you know designed to

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,950
move faster and you know breaking a lot

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,600
of things but if you're doing that you

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,890
also need to take an account that the

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
people that are working for you

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,980
like I know the whole the name of the

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,150
game is hyper growth and things like

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,890
that I know the whole name of the game

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,650
is hyper growth and things like that but

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,180
you also it provides them the

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,070
opportunity to build in an inclusive

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,720
culture from the ground up you know if

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,450
they're not doing that from the start

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,430
then it's gonna be you know them putting

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,900
band-aids on it you know until they get

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,089
to a point where more in life is gonna

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,350
be a lawsuit and then you know then they

00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:32,140
have a bigger problem on their hands so

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,980
yes it's it can be harder for them to do

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,050
that from the beginning

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,700
but it also gives them a chance to build

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,790
that into their company from the very

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,790
start

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,670
don't over complicate it make it simple

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,930
start with a conversation you know the

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,000
conversation with your peers

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,860
conversation with your managers it can

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,440
start with there so don't over

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,620
complicate it so these are my concerns

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,720
bring it to manners positions to to your

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,080
attention and then start there if

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,350
nothing happens then you can take it a

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,270
different route but that's

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,850
would be my suggestion start especially

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,350
especially in a smaller company where

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,300
you're not fortunate to have a DNI team

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,490
like we do all my it's kind of big and

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,290
if you all have heard of Walmart so

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,720
we're fortunate enough that we do have

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,400
dedicated DNI team like myself but

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,080
especially in the startup start the

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,730
conversation start asking the questions

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,680
attending these conferences learning all

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,720
those resources connecting with all the

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,780
people so I'm happy to connect with you

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,830
offline if you want me to hi my name is

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,600
Erin um

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:43,280
shameless plug I'm doing a book signing

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,140
tonight at 5:50 it's on augmented in

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,800
virtual realities so please check it out

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,350
if you want to get a free book great

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,900
presentation I love the Will Smith memes

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,380
so my question actually has to do with

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,840
like the 80/20 sort of breakdown that

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,420
like Google Offers so I found it to

00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,090
nonprofit someone is focused on women in

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,370
emerging tech called ARV our Academy the

00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:10,490
other is for Filipino Americans in steam

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,880
called faster and so in that process

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:16,400
I've found so many groups that may or

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,830
may have senior executive sponsorship

00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,720
may or may not have full-time diversity

00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,030
inclusion staff but what I find is you

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,160
know I'm growing this nonprofit as not

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,750
my full-time job it's on the side

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,390
eventually we want to hire staff the way

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,130
that code 2040 folks in the Latin X

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,920
community all other people of color

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,590
communities have been built but what I

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,600
notice is that huge gap of some folks

00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,910
don't necessarily have I think at

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,040
Salesforce they're Asian American group

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,410
where the Filipino group subgroup is

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,630
located they have something like the 1%

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,760
rule where it's like all of their

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:53,000
proceeds go back to Salesforce Oregon

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,520
profits so if your 9 to 5 job is paying

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,130
you to do diversity inclusion work part

00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,500
of the time outside of say engineering

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,210
then that's great but I also have a lot

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,610
of other folks who want to be involved

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,140
where I see representation burnout or

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,700
they don't have necessarily you know

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,900
that form of support so maybe my

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,060
question to you is like how do you

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,040
advocate for that and then maybe I'll

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,530
talk offline with some of you all on

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,510
strategies because uh I think just

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,950
seeing the disparity because not

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,640
everyone is so lucky that they work at

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,620
Google that

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,440
20% of their job you know can be diverse

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,209
inclusion projects how do you encourage

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,640
other companies to you know sort of

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,640
support the DNI with that level of

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,130
support yeah so if I understood

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,290
correctly you're asking how not only can

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,450
they support their engineers but also

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,829
just a larger community outside whether

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,480
it's like a nonprofit that the engineers

00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,579
care about if I understood correctly if

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,440
it's like actually integrated into their

00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:46,850
nine-to-five job so that it's like a

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,500
percentage right because that's not

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:54,380
necessarily the case for most companies

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:56,000
like Google right ok yeah again I've

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,480
mentioned at the beginning that a lot of

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,790
stuff was very personal for me if you're

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,680
gonna ask you know those engineers or

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,959
whoever to participate in those things

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,579
if you can't outright you know

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,079
compensate them as far as adding another

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,490
title to them then it needs a factor

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,950
into their performance appraisal you

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,779
know so that needs to you know if you

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,760
claim to care about these initiatives

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,930
and then you have because if you bring

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,640
someone from outside and you're gonna

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,140
pay them right you know you're not gonna

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,610
bring anyone in and do that that

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,720
volunteer work most of people you know

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,449
these consultants or whatever I'm going

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,399
to be paid but if you're expecting your

00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:32,630
urine you know already your employees to

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,209
contribute don't make that as a

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,640
deterrent or a don't penalize them for

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,230
that when it comes you know performance

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,300
appraisal time make sure that that

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,459
factors in to their overall job

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,550
performance that's one way I think that

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:48,649
can be can be improved upon that if you

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,660
really care about it then make it uh

00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,250
make it a you know part of your your job

00:16:50,660 --> 00:17:09,319
goal make it part of your performance

00:16:52,250 --> 00:17:13,730
plan like your style too we'll introduce

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,500
myself I'm Cory ello I'm an engineer I'm

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,929
a computer vision scientists at night

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,020
and a component design engineer during

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:23,299
the day that's what pays the bills I was

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:27,770
a very tough question to follow up - a

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:30,270
little bit more simple and so in the

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,060
interests of data and machine learning

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:37,110
stuff for your will test would you

00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:39,750
consider your your nine points all

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:45,150
fairly weighted or is there one that

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:47,130
jumps out at you as being more important

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,440
than the others I have my own thoughts

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,960
but I'm curious about what would you

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,860
what you think in regard to that that's

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,200
an interesting question

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:59,850
um I think is gonna be highly individual

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,590
you know some people may think you know

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,880
the points about the company structure

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,860
you know as we got the first question

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,390
you know what the startups those were

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,270
you know very very important to her

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,950
because you know that structure wasn't

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,540
there at all so the basically the first

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,000
four points for her went out the window

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:20,460
you know so I think for me personally

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,140
again it was highly personal but I don't

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:27,930
want in the interest of self-interest I

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:33,060
won't expand upon in public forum how I

00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:35,160
feel about certain things but yeah but I

00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,510
think for you know different people some

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,660
of those points are gonna hold more

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,970
weight than others I don't know if it's

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,100
up to me to say which ones are more

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,360
important because like different people

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,530
gonna be different situation cuz you may

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,180
have people who startups may have people

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,310
you know mid-sized companies you may

00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,900
have people huge corporations where you

00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,670
know some of those different factors are

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,840
gonna be wildly different across those

00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:00,720
spectrum or companies yeah so I think to

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,650
give you a more candid answer I could

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:09,270
probably do that offline perfect perfect

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:12,060
because I I won't give my number cuz you

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:17,390
know public channels recorded somewhere

00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,390
but yeah right thank you thank you

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:24,860
hi my name is Rhonda and I think this is

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,800
more a follow-up question about

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:33,980
searching for a diverse applicant pool

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:36,390
so I think as a as a hiring manager who

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,950
you know knew that was an issue all

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,840
along you know I was almost like

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,300
disappointed with myself when I had my

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,650
first I needed to hire somebody to hire

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,000
someone quickly and

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,060
I just hired someone I had worked with

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,220
before who you know was of course not a

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,870
diverse candidate so do you have

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,760
suggestions especially when you're

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,460
trying to hire someone more senior where

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,770
it's it's not as obvious that you can go

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,090
to like a specific school or I thinks a

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,150
lot of the conferences are more

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,830
entry-level and good places to look or

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,200
ways to kind of put the message out

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,350
there to hire more senior candidates who

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,630
have not only experience but also that

00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,260
perspective of like being different in

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,520
some axis yeah absolutely and again this

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,020
is gonna be me speaking from my personal

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,690
experience and I'm actually gonna give a

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,070
shout out to an organization that's near

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:29,580
and dear to my heart which is deaf color

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:31,170
and our organization was a deaf color so

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,200
we actually have two representatives in

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,610
the back from the organization who could

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,470
give you a much more information than I

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,740
can and they have a better grasp of the

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,330
statistics but our organization you have

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,740
to correct me on the number now but

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,180
we're in four different cities you know

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,650
starting here in the in the Bay Area

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,900
with the largest chapter over 200

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,930
members and I think over 60% of our

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,460
members are at the senior level so there

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,350
are different ways that you can go about

00:20:53,460 --> 00:21:00,540
finding you know senior talent and truth

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,930
be told us conferences conferences that

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,370
I've mentioned I've personally seen it

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,820
and personally kind of been a part of

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,620
where they've been poaching okay across

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,880
you know where you know one person will

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,500
be there recruiting for our company in

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,310
their stations XO another company is

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,600
like hey nudge-nudge

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:20,280
you know so that happens too but you

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,660
know deaf color is definitely one great

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,280
resource if you were looking for more

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,460
experienced candidates because we have a

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,510
large pool of you know more senior

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,640
engineers so that's a concrete example I

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,470
don't know if there's other you know

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,420
companies I mean it's the organizations

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,580
out there that are analog to deaf color

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,020
but that is definitely a starting point

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,020
that I can know director point you to

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,080
yeah these networking lunches I guess is

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,080
a another another good place

00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:15,000
I was just saying lakeville was saying

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,799
earlier it's really important to not

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,919
just have one strategy that you want to

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,280
kind of try all sorts of things like

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,169
coming to stuff like this and you know I

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,470
go to women nips

00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:30,270
all the time for web developers and I

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,539
meet other people there and we connect

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,909
and if and I mean sometimes there's just

00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:39,390
you know you're a standard white guy at

00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:41,940
the that comes regularly though because

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:45,059
he's trying to make sure that he has

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,500
access to this pool of talent that is

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:51,380
you know to help diversify so yeah I

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,580
also wanted to you know suggests it's

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:57,380
attending these luncheons and networking

00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,780
these conferences network talk to people

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,000
you know actually I this is the first

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,710
time I'm meeting well and his wife and

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,270
we found out we had a common interest

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,590
and the next thing you know we're

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,030
talking on and on and on sharing

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,380
pictures about it we won't share that we

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,950
can show you that offline this is being

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,179
recorded but with that said you know you

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,429
only you just never know

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,270
you just never know who knows who and

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:23,309
and use that network and you know I I

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,500
won't even get into the whole you know

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,450
top five schools and all that stuff and

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,640
you know we're changing our whole you

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,890
know recruiting strategy but using your

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,390
network just asking around because they

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,610
may actually have somebody they can

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,289
refer to you that looks like them if

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,929
that's what you know you're looking for

00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:42,929
so utilize these lunches go to these

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:50,070
it's it's really key so I'm all about

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,640
simplifying the process so see I'm

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:56,190
