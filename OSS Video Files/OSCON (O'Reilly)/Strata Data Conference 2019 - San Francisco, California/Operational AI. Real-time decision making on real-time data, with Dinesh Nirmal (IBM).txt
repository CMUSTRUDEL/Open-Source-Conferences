hi I'm parka Nathan and I'm here with

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,319
the Riley media we're at the strata data

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,150
conference in San Francisco and today

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,900
it's a pleasure to be joined with Dinesh

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,750
Norma

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,360
your vice president of analytics

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,910
development at IBM and you've just given

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,359
a keynote actually right so I just gave

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,150
a keynote on how Enterprise AI or how

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,260
the journey to air works a huge

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,650
challenge for enterprises because it

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,230
turns out that only 4% of the executives

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,219
admit that they have really successfully

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,170
implemented AI

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,450
which is very interesting because

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,700
there's a lot of talk about AI certain

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,950
you know how you infuse a or how do you

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,600
bring air into enterprise but it's not

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,329
easy it's it's a huge challenge for

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,100
enterprises to infuse AI into their into

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,780
their existing infrastructure what what

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,879
are the issues that are holding them

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,820
back for the ones who don't get to the

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,340
4% all right a lot of challenges right I

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,410
mean most enterprises were not born in

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,340
the last five years you're on in years I

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,360
mean they have been around for decades

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,830
and the question is how do you know they

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,180
have data silos I mean you know where

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,890
there's behavioral data there's social

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,020
data there's transactional data there's

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,049
data lakes data warehouses you name it

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,700
there's no shortage of data so but there

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,590
also exists data silos you know this

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,009
data exists in different systems

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,409
transactional system warehouse systems

00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,299
data lakes all those places and

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:30,060
different people on the data so and

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,729
nobody wants to move the data right so

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,079
that's what the data silos dispersion of

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,090
skills is another one I mean you know

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,340
you have a data engineer you have the IT

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,259
staff you have the data scientist you

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,210
have the data steward so you name it so

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,270
all kind of dispersion of skills in

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,860
different parts of the enterprise then

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,500
the architecture and technology that

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,439
existed for decades right I mean there

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,509
is legacy software that probably there's

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,430
nobody who knows about that over all

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,560
right yeah right I mean and then the

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,719
second piece is third-party software I

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,479
mean lot of banks use third parties

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,579
offer for example credit check all those

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,149
things right you don't have any way to

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,770
infuse ml unless they change it so you

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,750
know once you put all those pillars

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,360
together it becomes really tough for an

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,060
enterprise

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
to infuse mm I'll tell you story Paco I

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,980
was at a major bank a few months ago and

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,700
I was taking them through the whole a I

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,510
journey and the CEO and CTO said Dinesh

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,060
we got it

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,860
we built the model in six weeks it has

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,140
been 11 months to still have been

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,750
deployed it that is the truth about

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,450
Enterprise ai is that building model is

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,850
just one aspect of it getting the

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,980
trusted data to data scientist being

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,010
able to you know deploy that model

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,200
becomes a huge challenge so that's the

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,940
you know in a short way that's the

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,740
answer is that that's a challenge that

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,570
we face with the enterprise's I find

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,010
that in some ways it's almost inverted

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,140
from what some of the software

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,400
engineering expectations are building

00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,260
the initial model can almost be a

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,900
homework exercise for somebody just

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,250
starting but all that last mile of what

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,320
really matters in business with

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,390
customers that's the difficult part and

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,520
not only that once you deploy the model

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,770
there's SLA she of the minute I mean you

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,050
want the model to score in less than

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,970
eight milliseconds you know if it's a

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,620
credit card transaction I mean nobody's

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,269
going to wait around for trying to say

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,610
it's a fraudulent or not so you need to

00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,739
meet that certain kind of SLA and

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,120
milestones so it's not easy you know

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,209
there's a transaction that's running

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,489
under that SLA all of a sudden you did

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,590
an in transaction processing or infused

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,810
ml into that transaction how do you make

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,120
sure you meet that SLA so building the

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,519
model Paco is one piece of it but

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,190
getting the clean trusted data to data

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,200
scientist is another piece of it and

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,570
then the other piece is obviously how do

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,090
you deploy it and that's where I think I

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,580
would say 99% of enterprise have

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,930
challenges that you know how do we do it

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,180
how do you do to an existing

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,700
infrastructure that's working so well

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,700
and all of a sudden without breaking it

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,599
confused machine learning or area

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:07,299
couldn't you've said that data happens

00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,840
in real time but the decisions are being

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,760
made on typically what what you might

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,290
call stale data right

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,299
can you describe more about what you

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,889
mean about stale data how's this

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,630
differentiated and what can people do

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,579
about it right so actually I think

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,560
Forrester made that code that you know

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,539
all data originates in real time which

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,600
is true I mean you know regardless of it

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:31,539
data originates in real time but the

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,940
decisions are made on stale data most

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,889
decisions now we want to change that you

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,860
know how do you bring the real-time

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,260
decisions into the real-time data so if

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,940
you look at io T or sensor data how can

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,610
you move the processing to the edge

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,320
itself right now because those are the

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,000
kind of things that will help you to

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,740
make those decisions on real time

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,320
because right now what happens is the

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,419
sensor data is downloaded somewhere you

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,280
know processed ran a model on it and

00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,740
then made a decision that's too late I

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,830
mean it's like running fraud detection

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,599
on a data that you moved in your data

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,280
lake and it doesn't make sense you got

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,800
it wrong fraud detection right on your

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,530
transactional data you want to run you

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,780
know analytics or augment a tunnel like

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,970
right on the edge itself as the data is

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,949
coming in or build a gateway that can

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,620
process that amount of data so that's

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:23,530
what I mean like a lot of times the data

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,449
is generated in real time but most

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,729
decisions end up happening on stale data

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,550
and that's the push from enterprises to

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,919
move to a real-time real-time decision

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,750
making on real-time data we are nowhere

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,690
close to that but once we get there I

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:41,380
think things would be a lot easier I'll

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,919
give you an example why I believe AI is

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,960
not at that sophisticated level so let's

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:51,789
say I want to go on a vacation if I

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,010
search in a vacation in Russia I found a

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:56,620
deal I took the vacation even Beeks

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,470
after vacation I still see banners

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,990
popping up on my browser saying vacation

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,150
to Russia vacation you know cheap prices

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,460
or a product you buy right now weeks

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,340
after that it's not happening real-time

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,110
if if if the enterprise's knew that you

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,009
already took their vacation that they

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,469
could bring all the points to

00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:17,990
all the data silos ended together to

00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:18,949
make that connection that Paco already

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,930
took the vacation

00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:24,139
he liked Russia what else can be offered

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,699
in relating or recommend using a

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,619
recommendation in relation to that

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,569
vacation he took they are not anywhere

00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,919
there you know and even if you look at

00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,539
some other recommendation engines you

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,849
know I mean I see and I want to call out

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:38,059
any vendor but I see recommendations

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:40,399
coming I can tell there is no not much

00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:43,069
AI behind it it's just because I liked

00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,839
you know Calvin Klein don't send me

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,430
everything Calvin Klein I just liked a

00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,990
particular brand of Calvin Klein don't

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,999
send everything running underwear for

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,449
Calvin Klein I'm not interested so I

00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:54,080
don't think we are there from an AI

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,360
sophistication and intelligence

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,219
perspective we are in the process but

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,620
the real time like I said the example I

00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:02,360
gave you is very true because fraud is

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,009
true I mean the same thing that vacation

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,139
I mean you know child boats how many

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,759
child parts do we know that can go two

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:10,309
levels deeper you know without falling

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,559
apart so without you know so that's what

00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:14,419
I mean by real-time decision making is

00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,369
very critical on real-time data there's

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:18,319
so much upside though and and also the

00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,509
the challenges there I mean physics

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,830
really prevent us from doing a lot of

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:27,379
real-time if you have to have this long

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,969
long haul upload right right moving out

00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,939
to the edge makes so much sense right so

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:33,680
how do you get the processing power onto

00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:36,860
the edge right that's also the key

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,459
because so today if I take a small

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,529
example of like a thermostat I mean it

00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,809
is constantly sniffing the data right

00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,879
but it can also make the decision right

00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:49,159
there to say you know if you said it to

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,009
68 or reset it to cool it can lower or

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,659
higher the temperature as need be but

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,180
that's a very small example but you know

00:07:53,659 --> 00:08:00,139
you want to move that into let's say a

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,479
plane to say okay this sensor on this

00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,999
particular device is showing wear and

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,999
tear it's time for me to order a new

00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:10,219
part using the backend or ERP systems

00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:11,979
and the processing order so that if we

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,659
can get that whole supply chain

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,189
automated then the real-time decisions

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,139
make it much more there but we are

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,360
nowhere close to there the sensor can

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,829
send data it goes somewhere they process

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,289
the data then they make someone else

00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:25,819
this makes a decision so the decision is

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,370
not made real-time but like you said if

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,740
we can do

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,840
I think that would be you know that

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,580
would be true where I drew real-time

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,830
huge upside through this huge upside

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,529
huge upside I mean think about it if you

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,650
are an airline customer and the airline

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,510
can make decisions on real-time to make

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,760
you happy know your likes and dislikes

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,500
and give you the recommendations that

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,260
you need on real time I think that's

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,040
that's world-changing Forster recently

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,290
put IBM cloud private for data into the

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,410
top tier of what they're calling the

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,190
enterprise insight platform right what

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,070
distinguishes the IBM approach right so

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,140
what we have done is that we took

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:10,020
kubernetes the open source platform

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,779
layer and we built an end-to-end data

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,680
layer on top of it so whether you're

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,870
ingesting the data you know or you're

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,180
conducting or collecting the data you're

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,970
governing the data or managing the data

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,610
or whether you're analyzing the data or

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,529
you're infusing the data meaning you

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,660
want to do bias detection you wanted to

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,940
explain ability you want to see how the

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,560
model is drifting and when to retrain

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,900
the model or have real-time feedback

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,209
loop and being able to connect to the

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,700
enterprise github to say you know a

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:44,760
whole lifecycle of the model so we built

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,990
this end-to-end data platform that

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,120
enables the customers to go all the way

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,600
from ingest to visualize without ever

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,310
droppin the data which is a very

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,339
critical piece for enterprises so today

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,830
the reason the challenge that

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,690
enterprises face is that they will have

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,860
to take ten different 20 different 30

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,800
different products from several

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,990
different vendors put it all together

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,020
integrate it and then hope it works

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,630
right having an integrated end-to-end

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,029
stitch together data platform on top of

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,190
something like kubernetes makes perfect

00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:22,459
sense for a for an enterprise that's

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,500
building a platform or a data platform

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:27,600
kubernetes brings a lot of benefits like

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,390
the enterprise benefits like scalability

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,760
availability reliability security and

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,740
having a stitched together and to inform

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,010
data platform made perfect sense and

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,300
that's why Forrester put us at the top

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,100
because I don't think there's anything

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,720
like that exist

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,509
all day today especially the fact that

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,120
we had decades of knowledge of you know

00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:49,430
whether it's ETL or cleaning or

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,560
transforming the data ingesting the data

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,029
connecting to the data how do you

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,589
virtualize the data so we brought all

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,829
that knowledge into a single platform

00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,959
called IBM cloud private for data

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:02,899
fantastic amazing impact as far as

00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,819
operations as far as risk management

00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,459
right but cost savings that can imagine

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:08,990
as well I mean huge because now all of a

00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,850
sudden you don't have the IT staff

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,160
trying to put together 10 different

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,449
products right and going after 10

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,639
different vendors for 10 different

00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:20,959
problems you have a single throat to

00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,880
choke you have your end to end technical

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,639
capability on a data platform is taken

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,850
care of so all those things you know it

00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,339
brings in efficiency effectiveness cost

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,829
reduction performance all those things

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:35,300
so it has been a great story so far I

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:38,600
mean every customer that we have talked

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:41,509
to it has been really about resonated

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,769
5th fantastic I'd like to ask you some

00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:45,380
questions about open source kind of

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:50,000
bring that in the next your whole

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,800
organization at IBM is very much focused

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,519
in the news I'm gonna source very much

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,519
embracing this and why is that what what

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,220
what's this do for IBM right so we have

00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,990
been in the open source for a very long

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,670
time I mean if you look at the Linux

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,699
Foundation right we were one of the

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,310
early folks who invested and created

00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:11,990
help created when Microsoft was pushing

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,610
Windows I mean you know we wanted an

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,130
alternative it's the next open source

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,800
even if you look at eclipse you know we

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,199
were pioneering that you look at spark I

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,899
mean we were you know an allergic

00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,970
contact leader you look at Hadoop or

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,100
maybe were you know a huge contributor

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,889
in do you do you look at kubernetes I

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,449
mean you know we created the open kou

00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,310
and we made a huge investment as you

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,410
know recently in the kubernetes so I

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:40,399
mean you know the whole open source and

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,850
open shift and Red Hat so it's in our

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,649
DNA

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,930
you know a lot of people don't realize

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:48,010
it but we have been in open source long

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,690
before open source become so called

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,450
you know maybe sexy might be the wrong

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,280
word but you know so cool so we have

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,410
been there and we continue to invest it

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,900
and if you look at our IBM cloud private

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,690
for data it's built on open source with

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,080
the enterprise proprietary technology on

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:08,430
top of it what a lot of people don't

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:13,300
understand is that open source unless

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:15,220
unless it's combined with the vendor who

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,600
can really help the enterprise it

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,850
becomes a tricky situation

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,950
because what if it goes away you know

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,810
three years down the road and I can give

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,730
you plenty of examples on small open

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,590
source project that has come in you know

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,210
state for two three years and

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,670
disappeared so you don't want to be in

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,760
that so that's where a large vendor like

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,130
IBM plays a huge role to come in adopt

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,710
the open-source contribute into it

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,690
create an ecosystem around it being able

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,730
to bring it back to the enterprise with

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,260
security scalability availability

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,540
reliability all those enterprise

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,690
features then it becomes attractive to

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,750
the enterprise but rarely can an

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,880
enterprise go and consume it and given

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,380
the legal given the security all those

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,510
challenges there isn't all those risks

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,880
all those risks so it's they're very

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,590
careful but having someone like IBM you

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,020
know they are much more comfortable

00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,550
because there's the backing of IBM who

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,110
is you know either a committer or a

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,140
contributor to the open source have

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,270
created an ecosystem around it have have

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,590
put the right level of security and

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,880
there have gone to the right level of

00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,740
score scans through it's all those

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,300
things so it makes a huge difference and

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,920
our customers are embracing it and

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,840
that's why I think I've been cloud

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,730
private for data is doing so well is

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,670
because we built it on open source but

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,980
we also protocol or proprietary and core

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,440
technology on top of it well we see in

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,940
the conferences here I mean just as one

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,840
point of feedback reviewing the

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,250
proposals I learn about new open source

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,620
initiatives different projects that are

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,350
built on others because of IBM

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,090
committers who are proposing I learned

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,830
about this breadth of work coming out of

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,480
IBM in open source yeah we take it very

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,460
seriously and we contribute heavily I

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,720
mean you look at sparse eco you know

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,529
there's a tremendous amount of

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,629
technology that went from us

00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,129
so yeah I mean you know we do want to

00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:02,170
continue that another question

00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:04,069
obviously data and AI for enterprise

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,990
we've been talking about these but

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:09,079
they're very fast-moving targets they're

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,050
evolving rapidly what are the big trends

00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,550
that you see and and how are you getting

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,069
ahead of of that mm-hmm

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,350
so I'll name a couple I mean you know

00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,810
one is rec tech meaning the regular

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:24,920
regulation AI in regulatory technology

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:27,680
it's very tricky because one the

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,029
regulations keep changing and other than

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,980
the lawyers and the law makers who

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,110
created it nobody can really make too

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,569
much sense of it but if there is a way

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,029
to read those thousands of pages of

00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:40,850
document being able to extract the

00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:43,129
business terms from there kind of relate

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,870
that to your technical metadata to say

00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:46,879
okay you know here is what you have

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,410
here's the technical metadata that here

00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,649
here's the business that's relevant to

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,470
it that kind of extraction and being

00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,540
able to relate to it that AI

00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,019
recta ki is going to be hard because

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:03,680
that will need it will so we have it in

00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:05,180
ICP for data we call it Amelia so but

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,839
there's so many different regular

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,250
regulations exist today and each of them

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,519
requires some level of sophistication

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,610
and tuning by itself so we are

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,220
continuously developing it so I would

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:23,930
say one areas ragtag the other one I

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:25,759
think is digital twins which is gaining

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,300
a lot of momentum and popularity were

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,029
you know you have a part of a car but an

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,910
exact digital replica exists you know

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:37,040
and anytime that particular part changes

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,279
in the car the digital turn also changes

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,800
so you know I mean I see more and more

00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,750
you know AI for IT is another area that

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,550
I see more and more because how do you

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,589
manage your data center how do you do

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,870
compliance how do you do you know

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:52,639
anomaly detection how do you predict

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,680
something before it happens so I think

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,819
you know there are a lot of areas in AI

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,559
that is really taking off but I these

00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:02,959
are in a couple of areas that I think

00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,730
has a huge scope in the future you know

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,639
especially director ki for IT

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,589
and the digital twin you know especially

00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:12,990
around data and and these are not just

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,089
technology issues these are rampant

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,029
social issues we're talking about the

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,010
infrastructure that we rely on in terms

00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:22,769
of the digital twins we're talking about

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:26,309
energy and transportation we're talking

00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:28,019
about security and privacy and all of

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:29,760
these issues with data as far as the

00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,570
compliance right and we are going

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,710
through a phase where like you said you

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:39,210
know it's so critical to maintain

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,919
customers privacy and security I mean

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,500
you see in even in the valley some other

00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,360
companies going through the challenges

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,149
and we take it very seriously in IBM and

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,460
obviously you know I mean our customers

00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:53,730
security and and Trust is number one for

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,500
us so every product that goes out I mean

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,899
other some level certifications that we

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,820
have to do to get there but it's so

00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:01,769
critical I mean so important and as AI

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,659
comes along you know how do you make

00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:05,580
sure like facial recognition you know

00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:07,380
how do you make sure that you didn't

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,330
recognize somebody else's face and put

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,220
it out there right but there's a lot of

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,260
new technologies coming that's kind of

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,480
encroaching into the security and

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,940
privacy space which which is worrisome

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,700
but especially in the social media side

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,350
of things that has tech waterful talking

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,350
to - thank you so much thank you

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,030
