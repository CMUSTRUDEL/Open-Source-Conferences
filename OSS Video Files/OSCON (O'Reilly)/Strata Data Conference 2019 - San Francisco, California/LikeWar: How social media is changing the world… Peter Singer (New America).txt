Terrorists live-stream their attacks, “Twitter wars” sell music albums and produce real-world casualties, and viral misinformation alters not just the result of battles but the very fate of nations. The result is that war, tech, and politics have blurred into a new kind of battle space that plays out on our smartphones.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
we have this mass amount of data being

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,189
collected for example the average

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,290
millennial will take over 26,000 selfies

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,059
in their lifetime and they'll take it in

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,219
the most random of places whether it's a

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,740
party or that's in the middle of the

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,960
Battle of Mosul but it's not just the

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,449
youth we have the very first president

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,330
to abuse social media before he became

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,330
commander in chief not even Barack Obama

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,970
did Donald Trump though started at the

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,099
age of 61 and he still brought into the

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,690
White House over 40,000 bits of

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,300
information of everything from what he

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,070
was doing to what he was thinking which

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,040
then creates this wealth of data that

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,320
can be mined to learn about him and

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
learn what makes him tick

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,280
other times the information might be

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,989
shared unintentionally for example a lot

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,289
of people in this room probably use

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,030
exercise apps well people are looking at

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,090
a map of where they're being utilized

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,010
and they went huh isn't it strange that

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,140
in the middle of the Somali desert we

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,210
have a group of people exercising and

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,180
when they dug down in it as you can see

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,090
from that image there the outline showed

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,970
a base what was happening is that the

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,070
security at a CIA black site a

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,659
classified base we're doing their

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,060
morning jogs around the fence of the

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,909
base and revealing its location to the

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,799
world but the second rule is the truth

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,350
may be out there but it can be buried

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,060
underneath the sea of lies and this is

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,890
what we've seen in everything from its

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,079
effect in marketing to teenage life to

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,750
domestic political campaigns to Russian

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,659
disinformation operations for example as

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,610
long as we've had electronic mail it's

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,409
been targeted for hacking and it hit

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,119
presidential campaigns both the Obama

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,549
and the McCain campaign got hacked

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,320
stealing information but what made it

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,710
different is what gathers us here today

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,130
is the sharing of that data the mining

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,710
of it in 2016 we had what was claimed to

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,360
be a Romanian hacker gusoff or 2.0 we

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,820
now know it was gruesome

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,590
Russian military intelligence GRU that

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,290
broke into the DNC and stole the

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,410
information what gave it impact was

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,610
campaigns like Tennessee GOP there

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,330
Tennessee GOP it's a little bit small in

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,360
the text but basically the

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,480
say I love God I love my country and

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,400
they garnered over 44,000 followers with

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,160
this kind of messaging we now know that

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,320
Tennessee GOP was not a Tennessee

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,640
Republican it was a Russian sitting in

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,360
what's known as the internet research

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,570
agency they actually had more followers

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,180
by 10 times than the actual Tennessee

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,940
Republican Party but that's not the true

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,570
story of its impact on Election Day 2016

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:46,330
Tennessee GOP was the seventh most read

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,580
account not the seventh most read of the

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,800
more than 3,000 documented Russian sock

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,959
puppet accounts more than 60,000 Russian

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,230
bought accounts it was the seventh most

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,350
read overall more than almost every

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,070
single media outlet politician celebrity

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,100
you name it

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:06,850
same thing played out for instance in

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,880
terms of advertising we now know that a

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,490
hundred and forty-six million Americans

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,410
were unknowingly exposed to Russian

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,140
propaganda through ads like that on

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,550
Facebook don't just think of this as a

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:24,010
US issue in brexit we now know that

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,350
one-third of the online conversation in

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,820
the lead-up to that vote was generated

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,820
by inauthentic accounts

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,900
