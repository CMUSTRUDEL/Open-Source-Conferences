Airbnb uses AI and machine learning in many parts of its user-facing business. But it's also advancing the state of AI-powered internal tools. Theresa Johnson details the AI powering Airbnb's next-generation end-to-end metrics forecasting platform, which leverages machine learning, Bayesian inference, TensorFlow, Hadoop, and web technology.

well it's actually hard and sometimes

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,020
impossible people think to come up with

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,269
a theory of the business that actually

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,250
could allow you to map these you know

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,990
input metrics and how they flow together

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,690
so usually we avoid it and we say hey

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,490
just throw some features in there but I

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,250
took the approach that you know

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,289
physicists theorize the universe the

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,300
base you know based on how things worked

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,400
in the lab so when I was shooting those

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,289
particle beams at satellite surfaces I

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,929
was trying to come up with a fundamental

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,759
basis of this electron impacts this

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,890
which causes this amount of radiation

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,050
and what are the actual physical

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,329
processes that get us there we can do

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,180
the same thing for our business as data

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,950
scientists we can start to model out

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,539
what the flow of the business activities

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,190
are and that will get us to a better

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,309
theory if you will

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,010
theory of the case of how we can build

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,920
better forecasts and better augment

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,530
uncertainty so with each piece each step

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,070
of that process you can quantify the

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,320
uncertainty at each single step of how

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,750
the business flows through and that is

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,180
really really powerful to know how and

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,470
when you might be off and drive better

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,659
predictions around it so as we were

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,970
saying driver trees do require a theory

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,650
you do have to decide we're going to

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,090
build a theoretical model of the

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,430
business and sometimes that is daunting

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,740
but you can usually start somewhere

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,560
it's just insight into how your world

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,280
works its insight into hey number of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,479
impressions lead to this number of

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,119
clicks on this page which lead to this

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,540
number of contacts or you know number of

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,310
sales channels lead to this number of

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,430
you know leads lead to this number of

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,500
you know conversions you can actually

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,390
model that out and you can explain the

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,030
business based on its constituent parts

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,340
and so our forecast is really only going

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,350
to be as good as our theory and our

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,930
ability to understand uncertainty in

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,579
each parts of those value chain each

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,950
part of that value driver tree is going

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,710
to be as good as our theory so I'll give

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,129
you a quick example of how you might do

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,500
this with how many people trying to

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,629
forecast how many pool cleaners will

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,740
there be in Chicago now Chicago is not a

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,930
great example but

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,810
because why are there pools in Chicago

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,520
if anyone's ever been there this is a

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,900
much better example I think this is

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,940
somewhere in the Swiss Alps how many

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,890
pool cleaners are there in either case

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,430
you can use this for any part of your

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,670
business

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,550
so let's let's walk through it the pool

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,620
cleaner theory from the ground up so the

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,320
way Airbnb would do it is we would

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,230
create this model of how you get to pool

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,380
cleaners using both a supply side and a

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,900
demand side the demand side being you

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,580
know people living in Chicago people per

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,740
household households with share of

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,990
households with a pool pools needing

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,420
cleaning cleanings for pool per year

00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,330
cleanings in a year that's the demand

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,820
side of the equation and you would model

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,690
that out and say you know how many

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,690
people net-net

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,280
are gonna actually need this service

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,920
then you can model out the supply side

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,220
by taking at a high level working weeks

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,870
in a year working hours per week work at

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,520
work hours for pool cleaned I get you to

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,920
work hours for a pool cleaner in a year

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,020
and so on and so forth and you bring

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,580
those two sides together in this you

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,340
know two-sided marketplace of pool

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,930
cleaners to get to a final number of

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,030
pool cleaners in Chicago so what's

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,880
interesting about this and the key with

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,020
this is that you're actually forecasting

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,210
each individual metric separately right

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,700
so when you forecast each individual

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,770
metric separately ie number of people

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,780
living in Chicago you know where your

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,910
error is and where your uncertainty is

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,030
around that specific part of your

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,070
overall forecast you know exactly where

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,260
your uncertainty lies around number of

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,990
pools needing cleaning right and so you

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,420
can follow that through and say hey if

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,800
we titrate here that's actually what

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,220
it's going to lead to a number of pool

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,220
cleanings

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,670
