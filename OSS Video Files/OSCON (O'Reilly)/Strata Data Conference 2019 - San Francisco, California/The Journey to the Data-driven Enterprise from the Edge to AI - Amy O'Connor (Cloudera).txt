At Cloudera we “drink our own champagne” – running Cloudera on Cloudera. We create and collect data at the Edge – from cloud-based transaction systems and from our products customers run in the cloud and in data centers. We process and store that data. We analyze data and run probabilistic models to tune our business processes with AI – from marketing, sales and support to strategic planning. In this session I’ll share what we’ve learned from the Edge to AI and how its helping Cloudera and our customers get better at data-driven.
