At Cloudera we “drink our own champagne” – running Cloudera on Cloudera. We create and collect data at the Edge – from cloud-based transaction systems and from our products customers run in the cloud and in data centers. We process and store that data. We analyze data and run probabilistic models to tune our business processes with AI – from marketing, sales and support to strategic planning. In this session I’ll share what we’ve learned from the Edge to AI and how its helping Cloudera and our customers get better at data-driven.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,310
then we move on to machine learning so

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,980
cloud era recently merged with

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,679
Hortonworks the new cloud era is twice

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,750
the size of the company I sort of I'm

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,519
sure you folks are familiar with cloud

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,470
era and Hort works we have discovered

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,960
that we really were twins separated at

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,760
birth so as we brought these two

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
companies together one of the first

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,050
things that we needed to do was to take

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,000
the sets of accounts that we both were

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,039
looking at and figure out which ones

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,199
were the important ones that both of our

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,250
companies were focused on so we did a

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,530
bunch of different machine learning

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,050
algorithms in this space because as you

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,910
probably know most data sets don't have

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,910
really good high quality at unique

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,950
identifiers so the unique identifiers

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,890
were working with they do a lot of

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,539
string distance analytics to use URLs

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,460
and addresses and things like that and

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,559
then the algorithms gave our sales

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,570
operations folks confidence scores on

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,039
which of which set of customers should

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,100
we actually all be focused on together

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,449
now that we're one company and then

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,760
after we brought those data sets

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,809
together the next thing we need to do so

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,970
we just merge at the beginning of

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,560
January now we need to organize our

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,229
sales force and sort of reassign

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,030
accounts to the right folks so which

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,460
ones out of all those that we now have

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,380
should we really focus on in this case

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,090
we use some we used our clutter data

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,119
science workbench some of our underlying

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,549
tools a lot of open source plug-in tools

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,500
into the data science workbench to

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,540
cluster to do an unsupervised machine

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,119
learning algorithm to cluster the

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,310
accounts that looked alike and then we

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,020
layer on top of it which via accounts

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,850
have already bought and been successful

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,009
with our products and with their data

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,170
and that gives us a great indication as

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,880
to the other businesses out there that

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,659
could be much more successful using

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,299
their data from there we actually

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,610
stepped inside our accounts and we

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,649
looked at where do we have opportunities

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,540
that have already been identified where

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,490
do we have things in the pipe and we

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,560
looked at the behavior of those accounts

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,360
over time how much have they purchased

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,759
from us have they used professional

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,130
services are there people trained do

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,719
they have strong executive champion how

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,950
much are they already consuming of the

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,920
products that they've already purchased

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,520
and in that place we did a lot of

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,770
feature engineering

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,900
and built out a model that was sort of

00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,660
fairly complex in nature and it brings

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,940
me to another portion of cloud era that

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,870
we were able to leverage internally to

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,060
make sure that we could do these

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,190
algorithms much better so we have a

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,090
services organization called fast

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,250
forward labs

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,060
fast forward labs does two interesting

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,650
things one is they advise on

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,030
recommending models that you can use to

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,040
produce the best results that you have

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,810
and the second thing they do is they

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,850
provide a lot of research in the space

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,240
of data science and Xin learning and an

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,100
AI and the great thing about this is

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,810
I've got a small data science team

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,970
they're super bright they're really

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,710
smart but they can't possibly be

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,150
connected to all of the things that are

00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,760
happening out in the data science in the

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,260
EIA world so they leverage the advisory

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,780
services and the research from fast

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,970
forward labs and then the last piece

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,830
here is that we serve our analytical

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,620
insights directly into some of our web

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,200
applications in this case we serve a lot

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,180
of our research and our analysis on our

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,980
diagnostic bundles into a web

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,190
application that our support team uses

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,170
and we're able to predictively open 11%

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,790
of our support cases just based upon the

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,790
knowledge that we get from those models

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,230
