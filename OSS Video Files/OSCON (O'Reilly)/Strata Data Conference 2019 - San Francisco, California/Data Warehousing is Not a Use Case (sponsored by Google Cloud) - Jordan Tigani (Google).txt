	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
so I'm going to talk about data

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:09,030
warehouses and a data warehouse is is

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:11,460
not a use case a data warehouse is a

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,529
tool it's a tool that was developed to

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:20,250
solve a particular set of data problems

00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:22,020
just like just like any any tool this is

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,910
my house this is a house in Seattle it

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,760
was built using tools that were

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,750
developed to solve a particular set of

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,630
construction problems this is a some

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,100
skyscrapers being built in China the

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,690
tools that were used to build my house

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,129
are totally different tools than you

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,170
would need to build to build these

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,920
skyscrapers so what's different the

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,489
scale the use case is clearly the tools

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,899
need to evolve as as technology changes

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,760
now traditional data warehouses are

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,320
still are still important I'm not going

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,480
to try to convince you that you should

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,219
throw out your your traditional data

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,219
warehouses so how many people have a

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,410
data warehouse at their company all

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,809
right so lots of data warehouses how

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,260
many of those people use Hadoop or spark

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,850
or hive or Impala as well okay so

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,950
there's a bunch of people that have that

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,930
have both so if you have a data

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,150
warehouse and you still need Hadoop and

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,909
spark there's clearly some unmet data

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,400
processing and analysis needs how many

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,350
people use Kafka or pub/sub or Kinesis

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,670
or some sort of streaming how many

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,509
people incorporate that in their data

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,880
warehousing not very many so there's you

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,979
have all this rich data coming in and

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,189
you know you're not able to make make

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,470
decisions on that in in real time so

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,329
here's sort of how I think about about

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,460
data warehousing in the in the modern

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,979
world traditional data warehouses have

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,170
been in a box that box sits in your data

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,390
warehouse somewhere and it's it's a very

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,540
precious box and it has a certain number

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,149
of of CPU cores and certain number of

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,540
disks and you're really constrained by

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,820
what you can fit in that box but in sort

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,799
of the the modern world you move your

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,630
data warehouse to the cloud and really

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,790
your only constraints are the size of

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,530
the cloud data center and cloud data

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,530
centers these days are quite quite large

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,630
and the big benefit this gets you is the

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,060
separation of storage and compute

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,830
and you know what this allows you to do

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,150
is allows you to grow your storage as

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,830
much as you want and you grow your

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,690
compute as much as you want just by sort

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,810
of just by paying paying a little bit

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,970
more and typically it's the storage that

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,310
that people need more of so when when

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,740
Home Depot migrated to bigquery they had

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,680
a hundred terabytes of data in their in

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,110
their on-prem data warehouse two years

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,530
later they've got over over 20 petabytes

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,500
so you know over over a hundred fold

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,570
increase in in storage sizes and why is

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,520
that it's just because like you don't

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,890
have to cram all your data into this one

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,450
into this box anymore you can you don't

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,230
have to throw away data you can actually

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,280
get get get value out of all this all

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,530
this additional data and then serverless

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,350
you know nobody wants to manage servers

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,040
like so I think that's sort of a key key

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:11,370
benefit of moving to the cloud if you're

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,910
managing servers then you know you

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,140
should try something different so you

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,620
know that kind of covered the kind of

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,510
the basic basic data warehousing aisle

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,070
and is data warehousing use cases but

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,070
there's a bunch of other use cases that

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:29,060
you know that moving to the cloud and

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:31,320
sort of modern data warehousing allows

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,360
one of those is real time in real time

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,860
you know real time lets you make

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,370
decisions based on what's happening

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,200
right now

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,720
to give an example one of our customers

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,060
Zulily they you know they have daily

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,560
deals and you know kind of the

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,840
traditional data warehouse model where

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,480
you kind of you load the batch of

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,010
yesterday's yesterday's transactions in

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,610
and then you build reports on that and

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:56,220
analyze those reports by the time they

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,870
would get those reports like they have

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,000
no ability to actually change anything

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,130
because like they're on to the next the

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,540
next day so they they got reports every

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,060
hour they streamed it they would stream

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,390
data in and they'd be able to sort of

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,950
make make rapid on-the-fly changes that

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,740
that you know materially affected their

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,440
business you know personally I believe

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,859
that that sort of streaming is streaming

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,710
as the future the IDC says that by 2025

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,080
a quarter of all data analysis workloads

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,460
will be will be streaming but you know I

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,310
think it's actually even more important

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,250
that I think really all all large data

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,490
sets are fundamentally stream based and

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,690
maybe that's maybe I'm over over

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,849
overstepping a little bit but if you

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,740
think about it like large data sets are

00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:43,860
created one event at a time and those

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,860
single events are are really kind of

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,229
best processed in a stream and if people

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,449
have sort of dealt with sort of large

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:54,300
batch processing systems like they take

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:57,240
a lot of care and feeding if you want to

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,789
make your your operations workloads go

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,800
down one of the best ways of doing that

00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:06,180
is move your batch workloads to to

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,800
streaming workloads so less people have

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,120
data data lakes nowadays data lakes are

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,099
quite popular because there's a real

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,530
value of having all your storage in one

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:19,020
in one place you know your your ops your

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,789
ops data warehouse and your your finance

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,009
data warehouse you know you can you can

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,960
mix and match that data and you kind of

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,150
remove all your remove all your data

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,080
silos and you can grow that data as

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,470
large as you need so when you move to

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,900
the cloud

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,720
some things some things happen you get

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,780
some security stuff for free you know

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,120
any cloud vendor is going to you know

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,620
have good data center security they're

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,370
gonna have good you know they're gonna

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,810
patch the machines etc but there's some

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,880
things that you know people people

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,469
believe that they're you know they lose

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,789
control over their data they lose

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,560
control over how their data is stored

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:57,659
where it is and they lose you know the

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,889
ability to fire somebody if if something

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,840
goes wrong so there's a lot of

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,490
additional security features that you

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,919
need once you once you move to the cloud

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,360
I mean some of those some of those

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,099
interesting ones are you know

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,219
differential privacy so that you can

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:15,060
make sure that you know someone is only

00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:18,270
can't correlate and and D and identify

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,690
identify users or automatic PII

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,280
detection and and redaction sort of you

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,690
know these are kind of things that you

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,039
can do in a cloud world that are watch

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,810
more difficult to do and sort of the

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:32,669
more constrained the more constrained

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,159
model then there's data sharing data

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,990
sharing in collaboration in the old you

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,610
know when you had a single box for your

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,960
data warehouse in that data warehouse

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,020
you know sat in a date

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,330
Center somewhere it was very precious if

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,770
you wanted to run a query on it you know

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,449
you kind of had to be one of the select

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,639
few people or you had to ask ask

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,650
permission because they were generally

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,440
run at a hundred percent 100 percent

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,240
utilization you know if the whole data

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,849
center is really your your data

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,259
warehouse you should be able to anyone

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,060
should be able to run queries on your

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,460
data anyone should be able to get value

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,870
it's not just analyst it's not just

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,520
people who can write sequel it should be

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,039
people who can who can use a spreadsheet

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,960
who can drag and drop on a bi tool who

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,000
can you know form a coherent sentence

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,400
that can be processed by by natural

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,280
language processing so there's sort of

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,639
lots of value in in bringing bringing

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,599
data together and bringing data to to to

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,789
your whole organization and then lastly

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,669
there's there's predictive analysis if

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:34,860
real-time analysis tells you tells you

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,240
what what is happening now predictive

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,409
analysis lets you know what's happening

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
tomorrow

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:41,550
and I think that we've only started to

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,360
scratch the surface of what you can do

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,820
here because it just hasn't really been

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,039
hasn't really been something that's

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,810
that's an option but you know many many

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,000
people many of our customers are saying

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,460
hey we want to be able to leverage mlu

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,280
and leverage AI to to understand what's

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,530
happening in our data to do anomaly

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,599
detection to find defined problems to

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,610
find you know really like what are my

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,949
customers what are my customers going

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,930
going to do and then you can sort of

00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,800
take a step further from l a-- ml and

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,750
you can do AI you can you can figure out

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,729
you know what's the sentiment of all the

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,070
of all the the tweets that are being

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,930
tweeted about my about my company I'm

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,719
sure you could write code to do that

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,210
probably but you know if you could just

00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,800
do that in a single query that's you

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,449
know that's super super easy or if you

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,649
could translate all your all your user

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:36,060
messages from whatever languages

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:39,839
whatever languages they're in into into

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,240
English as also a single query so you

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,370
combine all these things together and

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,470
you know what you have is I think a lot

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,540
more than just what what's in a what you

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,110
can traditionally do in a in a data

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,820
warehouse

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,690
I think these sort of all do belong in

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,650
the same the same packaging of

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:59,140
modern data warehouse and I'm giving a

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,060
talk about about Google bigquery later

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,850
this afternoon if any of this you know

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,680
you disagree with or you agree with or

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,630
resonated and you know you want to you

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,990
want to come heckle me please feel free

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,440
to to stop by and and check that out

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,440
thank you

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,399
