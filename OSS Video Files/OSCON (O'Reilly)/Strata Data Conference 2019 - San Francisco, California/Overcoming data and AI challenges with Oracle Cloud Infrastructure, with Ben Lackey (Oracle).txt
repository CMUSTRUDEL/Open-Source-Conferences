hi my name is Paco Nathan and I'm here

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,799
at O'Reilly media's strata date at a

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,870
conference in San Francisco and today

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,509
it's pleasure to be joined by Ben Lackey

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,849
who's director of data and AI

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,730
partnerships at Oracle infrastructure

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,529
club Ben welcome thank you

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,689
welcome could you tell me a bit about

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,740
your background and your role in this

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,470
here oh sure yes so I joined Oracle

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,599
cloud infrastructure recently this last

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,200
year and it's sort of an interesting

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,940
move for me because I'm on the cloud

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,180
side prior to that I'd always been on

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,370
the ISV side so I'm part of a team that

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,190
Oracle's been building out to really

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,350
work more closely with a is fees and

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,739
partner more closely building out a

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,129
really open cloud ecosystem excellent

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,870
excellent

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,280
can you tell us a bit more in general

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,610
about the the Oracle cloud

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,010
infrastructure sure so this is a

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,739
next-generation cloud that Oracle's

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,379
building out the engineering team is

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,860
driven out of Seattle sort of cloud

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,510
capital of the world at this point

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,930
so lots of really really great

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,670
engineering talent and sort of taking

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,890
the opportunity to build a new cloud

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,040
from the ground up really without any

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,830
tech debt at this point and it gives us

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,150
a bunch of interesting advantages

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,460
there's sort of three pillars we're

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,400
basing this on the first is probably

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,340
unsurprising the best place to run

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,689
Oracle workloads certainly yeah so you

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,549
want to bring your database you've been

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,890
running for decades on Prem to the cloud

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,790
we offer great managed service to do

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,220
that works really well sort of following

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,899
on with the database really great

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,659
support for our line of business and

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,990
packaged applications so that's one

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,119
pillar the second one is around price

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,950
and performance so I mentioned we're

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,560
building a new cloud without tech debt

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,030
because we get to start fresh that's

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,299
allowing us to make it very very

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:07,740
efficient very high performance and that

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:11,580
transcends compute storage Network and

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,840
that allows us to do things like price

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,640
at less than our

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,470
well at the same time out performing

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,210
long interesting I mean some of the

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,970
evolution of cloud over the years the

00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,910
the more contemporary services are in my

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,330
opinion it seems like higher level

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,580
abstraction for for in customers to be

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,970
able to use is that some of the aspects

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,410
of next generation we are getting there

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,280
so we're building this thing from the

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,130
ground up and sort of starting at the

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,850
hardware layer trying to build up and up

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,660
and up

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,060
so this cloud originally started as bare

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,310
metal cloud interesting and the real

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,980
innovation there was off box for

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,830
virtualization both at the compute and

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,620
the network layer so no overhead to that

00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,140
virtualization very very interesting I

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,820
can imagine to especially in a lot of

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,880
high velocity kinds of situations that's

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,980
so crucial and that's where we had a lot

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,020
of our initial wins in the

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,500
high-performance computing space with

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,440
large compute clusters including even at

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,760
some academic institutions Oh fantastic

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,200
okay so in terms of data and AI what are

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,380
some of the key challenges that you're

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,070
seeing what Oracle is is working with

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,390
those four customers well I guess I even

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,510
flipping around I see it really the

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,610
opportunities so I look at our line of

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,790
business applications and we have all

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,739
this amazing data so like some of the

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,540
largest companies in the world depend on

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:47,920
our ARP systems to run their business so

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,810
one of the opportunities I see is

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,980
working with our partners in the AI

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,110
space to get insights on that data so

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,120
imagine looking at the ERP system we

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,310
know what the inventory is we know what

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,739
historical sales are we can do demand

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,420
prediction out of that interesting it's

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,570
a different way of breaking down the

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,459
silos it's alright there it is and it's

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,910
one of the strongest differentiators I

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,769
think we have is this legacy of these

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,010
package line of business applications

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,959
that enormous enterprises depend on and

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,970
from what I'm hearing - there's more

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,830
more applications of say machine

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,740
learning being applied for metadata

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,389
management or governance

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,880
kinds of concerns I can imagine that'll

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,340
play yeah no sure that that's probably

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,720
even further out there a lot of the use

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,039
cases we're really thinking about

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,990
immediately are these sorts of like ERP

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:44,039
supply chain things as well as a

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,500
customer experience one of the things

00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,349
I've been looking at a lot is how we can

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,860
work with the point-of-sale systems that

00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:54,930
Oracle owns a company called micros and

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:58,020
how we can leverage the data in there in

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,169
conjunction with technologies provided

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:06,180
by our ISV partners like h2o AI Oh

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:08,870
excellent okay that's kind of tangential

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,130
but let's expand out a bit on that

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,080
talking about some of these kinds of

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,080
partners how about the Big Data

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,099
ecosystem in general what's what's the

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,699
approach that Oracle cloud

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:23,970
infrastructure has toward they did in a

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,740
I echo system listen yeah so I sort of

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,740
mentioned these three pillars first off

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,909
Oracle second off price performance and

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,310
third is really this openness and that's

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:37,710
really leading our strategy there so one

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,940
example would be Oracle's partnered with

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:44,699
cloud era since 2011 the release of our

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,009
big data appliance which was effectively

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,469
some of the Sun hardware as an

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,409
engineered appliance with Ladera bundled

00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:56,250
in as something customers could purchase

00:05:52,409 --> 00:06:00,750
and run on Prem and that's evolved over

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,880
years to the point where now we have

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,490
terraform templates that will automate

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,280
the deployment of cloud era running on

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,289
Oracle cloud infrastructure and really

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,270
provide a push button experience for our

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:15,150
customers to get up and running with

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,979
that technology Oh fantastic I can

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,780
imagine that that could be applied

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,409
across the ecosystem to a lot of

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,349
different frameworks

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:25,710
oh and it is that's a merely one example

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:28,050
so in that space we're working with

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:32,069
cloud era we're working with Hortonworks

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:35,430
sort of map bar and so on and that's one

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,509
slice another slice would be the various

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,180
no sequel vendors

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:42,400
and that from a personal perspective has

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,229
been really fun for me because my last

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,389
two roles were at Couchbase and data

00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:50,410
stacks both of which are very close

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,750
partners of ours today in fact at the

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,410
booth this week we'll be demoing those

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:59,289
technologies running on Oracle cloud

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:01,810
fantastic how about openness how about

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,990
being an open platform how does that

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,419
help advance the echo system overall

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:11,259
well I it helps advance the ecosystem

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:13,690
because as much as any one vendor might

00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:17,740
want it to be true no customers going to

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,419
run only that vendors technology so

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,720
we're taking a very open approach we've

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,490
joined the CN CF as a Platinum Member

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:29,289
and we're contributing actively to it

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:32,740
one of my favorite contributions is a

00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:34,479
function framework so some other cloud

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,120
vendors have built their own functions

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,819
frameworks we've built one and open

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,740
sourced it that will run anywhere but is

00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,139
also being offered as a service running

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,240
on Oracle cloud Oh excellent so function

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,780
in terms of the context of server lists

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,190
exactly wow that's great yeah well what

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,550
types of language support does that have

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,669
well so the underlying stack is based on

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,349
docker okay so you can push e really any

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,240
language you want into a docker

00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:03,219
container and then the function

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,699
framework manages the execution of that

00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:08,889
also exposing services then micro

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,710
services so to speak it's we're viewing

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,780
it as a function so it's you can pass in

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,419
variables you get out or result right

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,190
and it's time bound as opposed to like a

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,650
full long containerized thing where it

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,259
might have an indefinite runtime this is

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,370
really intended to invoke execute return

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,500
okay done

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,300
Oh fantastic I love that pattern I'm so

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
glad to hear about more of this showing

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,300
up and open source to you because that's

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,919
that's kind of been one of the limiting

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,200
factors well yeah and it's really

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,060
interesting I mean we've got this with

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,000
the functions we've done a similar thing

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,729
with an eventing framework and then sort

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,800
of nearest and dearest to my heart is in

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,930
the infrastructure is code space right

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,360
so this is one of the advantages of

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,760
coming late is when other clouds

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,010
came into being the infrastructures code

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,180
space was incredibly immature so they

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,950
had to invent their own technologies we

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,589
haven't had to do that so there is no

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,750
proprietary OCI infrastructures code

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,360
technology instead we just take a

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,269
dependency on Hoshi corpse terraform and

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,190
then work with our ISV partners to

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,140
enable deploying their technology that

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,670
way fantastic I mean in my experience

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,640
that's been one of the real bottlenecks

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,589
as a customer is it's hard to get people

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,750
it's hard to get teams really staffed up

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:26,240
in there it's very competitive so having

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,790
those having that terraform support

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,740
support from the get-go is just real

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,140
critical I can mention now we've talked

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,690
a bit a bit before about what companies

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:40,240
are already working with and but is

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:43,160
there a strategy on the the partnering

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,320
yeah I mean we're sort of working

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,019
through the ecosystem in particular

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,950
areas and partnering with the best of

00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:54,230
breed vendors in each space so we're

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,750
doing that kind of David data gravity

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,760
work working with the big data companies

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,399
working with the no sequel vendors and

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,250
then at the same time we're working with

00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,490
sort of natural partners from our past

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,430
in the ecosystem so one example would be

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,810
if you look at the database that brings

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:17,089
a whole ecosystem around it and bi is

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,360
one great example there so working with

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:23,420
all the BI vendors to bring their bi

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,510
platforms to the Oracle cloud running

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,029
against the new autonomous database that

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,730
we have available there what's what's

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,470
the autonomous database ah that's what

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,480
we're calling our managed database

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,420
service Oh excellent and the thought is

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,220
it it deals with things like hardware

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,620
failures automatically it handles

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,480
upgrades automatically as well as some

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,610
cooler stuff we're doing or around

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,350
tuning queries automatically and so

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,850
forth Oh fantastic

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,110
all righty well thank you very much man

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,519
I wish all the best of the conference

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,699
here I look forward to the demos thanks

00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,699
a lot

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,560
