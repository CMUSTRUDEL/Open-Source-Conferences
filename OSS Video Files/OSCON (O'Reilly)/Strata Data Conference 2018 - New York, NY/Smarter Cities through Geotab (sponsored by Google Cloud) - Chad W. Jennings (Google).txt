Title: Smarter Cities through Geotab (sponsored by Google Cloud) - Chad W. Jennings (Google)
Publication date: 2018-09-14
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Cities all over the world are using data and analytics to optimize infrastructure, but city planners are often held back by outdated data gathering methods and legacy analysis tools. Chad Jennings details how Geotab, a leader in IoT fleet logistics, brought BigQuery's unique machine learning and geospatial capabilities to its existing datasets to deliver a more capable solution to city planners.

	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,830
we are gonna spend a little bit of time

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,010
talking mana as Alistair described

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,800
talking about traffic and we're gonna

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,200
try to introduce a concept here where

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,849
we're going to make cities smarter using

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,730
geotab and a couple really neat new

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,130
tools that came out recently in bigquery

00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,240
and so for the next few minutes what I

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,460
would like us all to do is imagine

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,769
ourselves not sitting here at a strata

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,830
conference but instead we're gonna step

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,309
into the shoes of a traffic planner from

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,410
the city of Chicago and this is you know

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,200
Alistair called it this like marvelously

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,570
choreographed dance I have different

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,890
less lofty words for my traffic

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,820
commuting experience right it's not a

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,800
great way to start your day

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,920
frankly it's not a great way to end your

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,350
day either and the the list of

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,300
pernicious outcomes for municipalities

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,649
like not just New York not Chicago not

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,160
just where you're from but the world

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,170
over are pretty extensive like not just

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,010
the lost opportunity or the opportunity

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,780
cost of that lost productivity but

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,720
commute times and long commute times can

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,610
actually separate people from

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,140
opportunity and that disproportionately

00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,330
affects folks at the lower income ranges

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,330
than folks at the higher end plainly

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,100
it's not good for the environment so as

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,390
our city planner is right we're all city

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,070
planners for the next few minutes how

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,720
are we going to solve this well we're

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,759
not going to solve it by pouring

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,950
concrete I live in Seattle there is

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,530
simply not enough room between the water

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,540
and the mountains to have a new 42 lane

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,180
highway which would probably solve the

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,890
problem but we can't do it so smart

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,500
cities all over the world are looking to

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,020
data and analytics to solve this issue

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,930
and if you're going to do you know sorry

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,509
things like real-time adaptive street

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,520
lights which pretty cool shared mobility

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,470
solutions like we all you use those

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,810
rideshares and if you haven't heard

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,369
about it flying car share it's a thing

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,320
if you don't know about it go look it up

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,600
it's gonna be awesome like honestly the

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,600
Jetsons are you know quote around the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,950
corner but if you're gonna do data and

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,420
analytics and if you're gonna go to a

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,000
data in a dialect solution you better

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,209
start with good data so enter geotab

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,550
they're a customer of ours and this

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,740
image of the United States is not just a

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,290
stylized picture to take up space

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,530
a slide that is actually a point cloud

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,690
image of one day of geotubes location

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,120
data there in addition to being a

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,400
telematics company geotab is also

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,860
provides asset tracking services so for

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,410
example all UPS trucks have a little

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,320
geotab box in them and that box records

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,610
position velocity and acceleration and

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,290
that acceleration part is going to come

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,720
relevant later and once you have that

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,670
data set oh sorry and so you can infer

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,560
quite a bit of what the traffic is doing

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,020
around the world by looking at this data

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,790
right it's quite dense data and what

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,490
tools are they going to use well I'm

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,370
from Google you almost expected this one

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,920
to happen bigquery is Google's fully

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,770
managed server lists enterprise data

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,470
warehouse and that's where geotab stores

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,490
all of this data and to process it for

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,840
the demo that we're going to do later

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,980
we're going to use a couple really

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,430
interesting tools

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,280
so just in July we launched bigquery ml

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,770
and to do though to to create this we

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,800
made up a few new sequel verbs that

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:26,090
allow analysts right in sequel to train

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,920
evaluate and predict with ml models so

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,660
instead of just having machine learning

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,310
be like that shining light at the

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,810
pinnacle of the pyramid that we saw on a

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,950
talk earlier we are by having these

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,870
commands inside of sequel we're trying

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,260
to bring this down so that any analyst

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,880
anyone that speaks sequel can do ml

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,420
similarly we're launching today right

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:52,140
now bigquery GIS and in so doing we're

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:55,140
making bigquery the only cloud MPP

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,420
enterprise data warehouse to have

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,400
first-class support of geospatial data

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,400
types and functions really excited about

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,560
that and we're also launching to beta

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,420
bigquery geo of this this is a

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,820
lightweight visualization tool that

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,280
solves the use case of I'm an analyst

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,500
and I just ran a query and I want to

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,180
visualize the results on a map and then

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,630
you can do some interactive styling as

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:23,729
the gif here shows so using bigquery the

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:26,410
query ml bigquery GIS and geo tabs data

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:32,860
we are going to cut over to a demo

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:41,590
and again this demo hold on a sign of

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:45,220
the times right now we test if Chad can

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,930
write his excellent so yes I can enter

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,620
my password in front of a lot of people

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,960
the first time without messing it up so

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,000
so again we're Chicago city traffic

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,380
planners and this is an app that geotab

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,760
is built using the tools that we

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,100
discussed just a second ago

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,620
and so what's going on here is on the

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,020
left hand side is a heat map of traffic

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,520
in the city of Chicago and on the right

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,360
hand side is going to be an ml based

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,580
prediction and way on the right tab over

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,140
here I'm gonna dial in some weather

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,570
conditions right I'm gonna make it a

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,630
little bit colder bring the visibility

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,760
down I'm gonna order some snow and we're

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,400
gonna pretend it's the holidays and this

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,350
is now running a prediction on it's say

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,750
assuming those weather conditions what

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,520
is the traffic gonna be interesting

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,860
facts they're actually using the public

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,140
data set that NOAA publishes inside of

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,030
Google cloud platform to do this join so

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,000
way to go NOAA our tax dollars at work

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,790
here and so you can see that the map

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,470
gets a lot hotter and what we're gonna

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,810
do is we're literally going to double

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,510
click into one situation right here

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:53,530
I've been waiting all month to use that

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:56,110
pun and so we'll take a look at this hot

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,630
spot right here and the reason we've

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,710
chosen this one is because it happens to

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,570
be right down the street

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,180
just a little bit east of this school

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,010
and so by presenting the results in a

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,600
heat map on Google Maps we also get the

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,000
benefit of some of the other Google Maps

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,000
infrastructure and we can drop the

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,250
street view avatar in and see what's

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,310
going on all right so there's the school

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,500
and let's go back down the street a

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,450
little bit to the east and what we can

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,160
see here is that this is where the kids

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,570
are storing their bikes and there's an

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,610
alleyway right next to it so maybe

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,740
what's happening is the kids are coming

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,030
down the alleyway and cars are having to

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,919
react to them and hitting their brakes

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,750
you know just a little bit further up

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,070
the street here and as we pan around we

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,350
can also see that there's no traffic

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,610
signage here at all so maybe the right

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,550
remediation is too

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,110
put you know pre-positioned some sand

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,750
maybe the right remediation is to

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,129
actually put in a stop sign but as this

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,849
chicago city planner

00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:54,400
you've now used ml GIS Google Maps and

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:56,319
Street View to literally parachute into

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,289
a problem and investigate what a good

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,349
solution might be if you're curious

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:04,449
about how that demo works and if you're

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:06,849
curious to see the rest of the demo

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,199
please come along to our talk thank you

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,500
very much for your time my name is Chad
