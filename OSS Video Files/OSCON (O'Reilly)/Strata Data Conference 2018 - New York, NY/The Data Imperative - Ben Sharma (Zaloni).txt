Title: The Data Imperative - Ben Sharma (Zaloni)
Publication date: 2018-09-13
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Once, a company could live 60-70 years on the S&P 500. Now it averages 15 years. If companies were people, this would be an epidemic on par with the Black Plague. But the same things that dragged humanity out of that dark age can drag companies out of this one.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,970
this is a picture of the library at

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,330
Alexandria 48 BC that was burnt to the

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,809
ground we shudder to think about what

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:19,820
was lost all the plays the poems the

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:23,670
plans that was the genius of generations

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,640
losing data and not having access to

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,619
data is a big deal and we don't have to

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,510
go back to 48 BC just a few Sundays ago

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,270
90 percent of Brazil's National Museum

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,090
was destroyed all the priceless

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,329
artifacts dating back to thousands of

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,289
years I don't have to tell anyone in

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,379
this audience the value of data it is

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:53,340
our business it is our community it's

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:57,930
our lives I believe in something I call

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,020
the Data imperative simply put it's our

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,280
responsibility as we go through digital

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,280
transformation where it is not just

00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,760
profitable and smart and open but it's

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:17,640
also wise as Dinesh had talked about

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,700
earlier Pizza is not a fruit when we

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,430
look back at the dark ages for all

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,030
intents and purposes what we had was a

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,520
data swamp people had the knowledge to

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:35,189
survive but not the wisdom to thrive and

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,159
then came along the printing press we're

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:43,610
in first time in the history it helped

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:46,320
us capture store and share data at scale

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,790
leading to massive multidisciplinary

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,000
thinking all great innovation happens

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,479
when culture people ideas and

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,149
technologies come together so the moral

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,549
of the story here is that when you make

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,549
information available from variety of

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,799
different data sources new ideas emerge

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,799
and outdated paradigms change

00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:17,689
forget the adage where it says that you

00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:20,269
can never cross the same river twice in

00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:24,769
today's world you cannot generate the

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:28,689
same report place businesses used to be

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:32,329
Newtonian which is fixed measurable

00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:35,319
predictable we are moving more and more

00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:40,099
to be quantum which is fluid

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,980
probabilistic and unpredictable the days

00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:47,090
of machines in basement generating

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:50,169
monthly reports are long gone you know

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:54,470
all the V's in the space add one more

00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:58,689
volatility when policies are these days

00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:02,359
made over a tweet how can you survive

00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:06,889
what is your competitive mode so that

00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:13,430
you are able to be as disruptive as the

00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:17,209
disruptors the average lifespan of

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:20,659
companies in S&P 500 used to be 60 to 70

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,060
years this year the lifespan will be

00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:26,479
around 22 years who knows what it will

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:30,530
be next year this equates to a massive

00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,449
epidemic for today's companies so how do

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,199
you strengthen your corporate immune

00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:39,919
system to be able to survive against

00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:43,209
these issues so let's think about a

00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:46,659
couple of different items so one is

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:49,159
being able to automate the nones

00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,790
automate the repeatable processes and

00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,699
then also augment the unknowns being

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,669
able to augment humans ability to be

00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:02,180
able to do their jobs better by

00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:05,810
correcting the biases that they have by

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,129
also allowing them to explore the

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,129
unknowns the what-ifs

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,900
let's take banking as an example since

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:19,799
we are here in New York so there is a

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,480
constant struggle by the back-office to

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,340
be able to keep up with the changing

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,250
regulations and to meet the compliance

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,560
reports at the same time the front

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,840
office is getting hammered with new

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,370
business models with startups coming up

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,510
with new technologies so how do you meet

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,700
these requirements

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:42,540
the only choice is to be as disruptive

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,570
as the disruptors earlier customers had

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,750
only one option which is the bank now it

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:53,870
is the bank and Apple pay venmo

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:57,740
Bitcoin and more so that being the case

00:04:53,870 --> 00:05:00,500
where static predictability is gone

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,660
the solution is self-service and

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,940
democratization of data you want to

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,250
empower your people where they have

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,840
access to the right data at the right

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:18,990
time in the right formats and this goes

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:21,810
beyond just banking you're able to use

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,280
data in this manner to be able to come

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,770
up with new products and services that

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,660
delight your customers to be able to

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,850
meet your compliance requirements in

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,610
near real-time and to be able to make

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,760
better faster decisions because risks

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,280
and rewards are baked in but the key

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,169
here is that your data needs to be

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:46,380
accurate fresh and reliable and you need

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,229
to give access to the right people when

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,729
they need it and where they need it

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:58,380
using a modern self-service data

00:05:50,729 --> 00:06:01,590
platform so just to summarize what got

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,290
us out of the dark ages was

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:07,110
democratization of the data in form of a

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:10,160
printing press what will get businesses

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,990
out of today's Dark Ages is also

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,530
democratization of data in terms of a

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,840
self-service data platform remember

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,750
Alexandria so if you want to fireproof

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,420
your data think about a self-service

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,530
data like platform with a managed and

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,530
govern view thank you

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,830
