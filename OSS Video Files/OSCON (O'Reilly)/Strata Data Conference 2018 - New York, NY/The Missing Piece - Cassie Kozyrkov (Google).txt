Title: The Missing Piece - Cassie Kozyrkov (Google)
Publication date: 2018-09-13
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Why do businesses fail at machine learning despite its tremendous potential and the excitement it generates? Is the answer always in data, algorithms, and infrastructure, or is there a subtler problem? Will things improve in the near future? Let's talk about some lessons learned at Google and what they mean for applied data science.

but in addition to that look I know that

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:09,030
we as engineers and mathematicians we

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,670
like to reinvent our own wheels totally

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,799
guilty of it myself

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,949
but are we really sure that if we want

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,220
to start orienting data science in the

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,830
right direction and focusing towards

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,960
being as useful as possible that our

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,730
discipline is the only one that knows

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,830
about decision making or that we should

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,660
reinvent everything that humanity does

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,899
know about decision making from scratch

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,730
I mean philosophers have been thinking

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,360
about this stuff for thousands of years

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,770
and the social sciences for hundreds

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,989
neuroscience for decades are we just

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,640
going to ignore all of that and reinvent

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,200
that wheel well we shouldn't expect that

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,030
we're going to get very much success

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,940
that way so here's what I propose

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:55,110
instead why not start over

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,719
why not make a discipline that is

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,660
oriented on transforming information

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,149
into better actions and ask everybody

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,700
who has something to say on that score

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,610
to participate to welcome a diversity of

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,409
skills and perspectives and of course

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,659
current data science is going to be a

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,369
big chunk of that but the managerial and

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,030
social sciences have to be there as well

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,950
and also all the other disciplines that

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,229
have those nuggets of wisdom that we

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,740
should be collecting because we have so

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,310
much data our goal should be to make it

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,310
useful

00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,610
