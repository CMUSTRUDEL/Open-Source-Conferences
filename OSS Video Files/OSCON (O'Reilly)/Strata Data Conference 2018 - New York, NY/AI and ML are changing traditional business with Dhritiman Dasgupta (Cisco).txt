I'm Roger McGough liz here at strata

00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:07,140
2018 in New York City and I'm here with

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,080
DD Das Gupta who is the VP of data

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,370
center marketing for a Cisco welcome

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,139
thanks Rob

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,880
so you gave a keynote today on AI ml and

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,220
IOT and how that will destroy the data

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,720
center in the cloud just not in the way

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,609
you think mm-hmm then you could

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,699
elaborate a little on what that means

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,890
sure thing so first off it was

00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,810
intentionally a provocative title so

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,399
that I could get butts and seats and and

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,680
then you know when I had the butts in

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,930
seats just to wake them up data centers

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,230
are not going away cloud is not going

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,520
away

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,770
IOT is here to stay the thing is what

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,780
these data centers do the expectation

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,399
from the data center that is changing

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,920
where compute is happening where

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,829
learning is happening the new sources of

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,840
data that's changing so it's a complete

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,670
rethink of the underlying infrastructure

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,890
that needs to support these new

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,530
applications and the explosion of data

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,420
that's basically what the talk was was

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,580
all about ok so it sounds like a more

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,020
holistic yeah approach which kind of

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,520
brings up the edge and actually I know

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,439
before this talk were talking them about

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,299
the edge as things move around I mean

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,780
what do you think the implications are

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,220
and why is this happening yeah so the

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,189
edges is is here it's happening right

00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,909
and what's interesting about the edge is

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,860
the data I mean in an average camera is

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,350
collecting something like in 300

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,380
gigabits of data per per second right

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,540
you put these you know all around a car

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,950
you've got 18 of these you think about a

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,149
sensor in an oil rig in the middle of

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,750
the Pacific Ocean I mean that's

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,159
collecting tons of data and so the edge

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,840
is happening I mean the edge is always

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,899
been there but the interesting thing is

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,840
the data and this data can now be used

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,700
in much more meaningful ways thanks to

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,360
all of the data scientists here are this

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,860
show new applications that are more

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,439
machine learning enable deep learning

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,490
enable that's basically the big change

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,550
and so it's the ability of our customers

00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,280
to be able to capture the data curate it

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,100
process it and use it for insights in

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,650
real time that's that's what you know

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,290
this whole edge discussion is all about

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,010
okay now you've brought up deep learning

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,800
and apparently cisco has a new product

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,200
and now that's right very show that

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,570
addresses deep learning yeah we can

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,320
describe itself absolutely so it's a new

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,900
server that we just brought out into the

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:46,310
market we announced it just earlier this

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,720
week it's called a UCS 480 ml ml for

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:53,480
machine learning and deep learning

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:55,700
workloads so the thing is what these new

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,100
workloads these new algorithms are doing

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,920
is you need some very heavy-duty data

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,140
crunching and so we've partnered with

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,440
Nvidia and we've got Nvidia you know

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,960
chipsets inside inside this new server

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,370
and the difference between us and I

00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,770
would say every other vendor was gonna

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,160
Bend sheet metal around these chipsets

00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,780
is the way in how we manage these boxes

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,880
right because you're never gonna have

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,350
one box you're gonna have multiples of

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,600
these and you're gonna have multiple

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,490
data centers and you'll need you know

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,070
need it for big workloads more small

00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,080
workloads and so that's the new server

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,180
super excited about it it's on the show

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,070
floor encouraging everybody to go take a

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,200
look I think it's gonna win a few Awards

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,460
in this in this show great now I'm just

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,770
curious with that with that kind of

00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,960
machine are you doing anything special

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:46,280
beyond the Nvidia are you providing any

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:49,430
kind of application layer or tensorflow

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,690
PI torch who you are we have partnered

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,250
with all those names that you just

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,500
mentioned and that's another advantage

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,570
of you know servers from Francisco

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,130
because it's you know it's one thing to

00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,450
just build a server and then just tell a

00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,970
customer go figure out what you want to

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,340
do with it it's another thing to partner

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,070
to like come up with validated design

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,140
guides tested with real life you know

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,150
real-world workloads which is what we've

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,780
done so we've partnered with you know pi

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:17,239
torch and Google and you know anaconda

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,700
and then also some of our traditional

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,269
partners from the Big Data world like

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,280
cloud era like

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,080
Hortonworks so we've partnered with all

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,210
of these folks as we've brought this

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,259
technology into the market that's great

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,090
is there anything else you're doing to

00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,360
help I kind of facilitate the data

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,039
scientist to work better at it since

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,699
you've already done a lot we have I mean

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:42,000
look I'm in marketing okay and turns out

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,490
I have a huge population of data

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,289
scientists in my organization because

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,270
it's it's all about you know in

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,310
marketing you're you're tracking leads

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,720
you're seeing who goes to which show and

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,150
do they go back home and read the white

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,030
paper so it's a lot of data collection

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,180
so I think it's it's super exciting the

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,860
you know how data scientists and machine

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,389
learning and deep learning is turning

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,870
you know you in an industry like

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:08,430
marketing on its head so yeah we're sort

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,169
of eating our own dog food from from

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,479
that perspective right so we're creating

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,060
all of this data but also using a lot of

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,099
this data at Cisco in marketing that's

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,199
great laces yeah well hope you have a

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:20,130
great show here yeah thank you thanks

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,000
for spending time with us

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,000
