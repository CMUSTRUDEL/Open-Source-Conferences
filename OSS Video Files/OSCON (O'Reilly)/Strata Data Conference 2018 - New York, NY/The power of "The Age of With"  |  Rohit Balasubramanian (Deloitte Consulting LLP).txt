Haruhi very good to see welcome to

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,099
strata now I understand that Deloitte

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,460
has a new initiative here which are

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,219
discussing a strata absolutely yes it's

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,279
basically a new way of looking at things

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,949
how we go about delivering our services

00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,050
it's called the age of width right and

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,689
if you think about it what the age of it

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,900
really means is we are moving now into

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,090
an age where humans and technology are

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,369
gonna be working together in ways that

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,219
we did not really imagine before right

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,260
that this is not about machines

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,040
replacing humans right it's actually

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,350
about them working together leveraging

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,750
disruptive technologies to unlock new

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,239
products to unlock new innovation to

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,739
unlock unimaginative alyou and that

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,530
really is the power of the age of width

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,260
if you think about it width has always

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,480
been what I like to call the great human

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,940
advantage in Sue Dean yes right at the

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,920
core of all of our great inventions

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,320
right if you think about the wheel you

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,110
think about planes all the way to the

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,510
internet and so now using disruptive and

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,510
modernized technology we're gonna unlock

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,310
incredible value in this age of wood so

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,950
it's it's not sort of an end tag in this

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,460
take few of machines versus many people

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,740
it's more about as you said teams teams

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,950
it's about synergy yeah right and it's

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,430
truly about integration of Technology

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,040
and people across processes as well now

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,079
coming into strata looking in industry

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,930
and trends and all coming into this at

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,759
this point in time I can imagine what

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,770
you're talking about there has a very

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,479
large addressable market I can imagine

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,060
this applies to a large segment in

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,680
industry

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,240
if you look at organizations and you

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,470
know we obviously work across industry

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,110
and what we're seeing in our

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:54,110
conversations is that you know there's a

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,270
whole swath of the organizations which

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,210
are still operating primarily on what we

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,580
call legacy architectures exactly so

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:05,030
that'd be data platforms such as already

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,790
BMS structured data be mainframes a

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,190
whole bunch of structured processes

00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,740
around technology leading to certain

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,270
very predictable outcomes what we are

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,940
talking about here now the conversation

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,070
changer is using things such as cloud

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,960
centric technologies using modernize

00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,020
architectures Big Data data lakes

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,400
cognitive to kind of unlock the new

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,560
value that we're saying and that's

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,450
really is you know the opportunity out

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,950
there but to answer your question you

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,840
know absolutely there's a massive

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,550
addressable market in fact I thought

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,260
there was a study that was done by MIT

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,540
Sloan yeah you know 54% of the market is

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,850
apparently untapped that's a great great

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,130
opportunity for all of us outstanding

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,770
and and the kind of benefits that an

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,930
organization realizes once they begin to

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,230
go through this conference

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,760
transformation

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,470
and we give you the right word

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,629
transformation this truly is a

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,180
transformation right whether it's a

00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:01,610
functional transformation from a finance

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,319
transformation perspective or a sales

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,780
transformation or whatever the business

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,340
very very business anchored but it is a

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,660
technology transformation at the end of

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,370
the day as well okay

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,599
there are massive benefits if you just

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,910
think in terms of cloud centric

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,940
architectures you know scalability comes

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,410
to mind data is growing right now twice

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,290
the speed of sound is what I like to say

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,420
right I mean 2 X 4 X is what the scale

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,920
of data is changing year-over-year so to

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,810
be able to manage those been on that

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,610
volume of data and that variety of data

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,890
you need to have scalable flexible

00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,049
platforms such as cloud such as data

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,400
legs neither the on-premise legs as well

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,670
whether it's the new or whatever it is

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,099
right so being able to do all of that is

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:43,849
one benefit second benefit like I said

00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,310
is anchored around business value being

00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,130
able to come up with new products with

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,130
innovations with ease-of-use where

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,500
business now drives the innovation and

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,730
the technology changes as well those are

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,790
some of the massive benefits that we see

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,440
and last but not least the overriding

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,260
benefit of all of this is truly

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,920
unlocking value right higher order

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,780
processing higher order skill set

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,400
efficiencies leading to higher order

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,900
value

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,150
I can imagine the stakes are high too

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,769
because AI is catching on and some

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,540
organizations are very sophisticated in

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,260
this but now this is this is a way to

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,190
really take mainstream to take a large

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,740
absolutely there are gonna be first

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,120
movers right right right I'm so be to

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,430
your point really absolutely saying that

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,229
the way we see that is across three

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,840
horizons of an option if you will when

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:34,360
it comes to cognitive and modernized

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,370
analytics right horizon one is where

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,350
many people are kind of getting into now

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,360
in terms of organizations right this is

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,210
where there are there are modernized

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,800
techniques processes and technologies

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,020
that are being adopted but they're being

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,850
adopted in a very modular way right

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,500
which is you know which is around

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,139
repeatable processes and stuff like that

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,000
right the next horizon which is kind of

00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,940
where you know the leaders are moving

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,760
into is where truly you have humans

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,130
working with these repeatable processes

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,889
be them bots or whatever to be able to

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,479
you know enhance that value chain give

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,310
you an example in the insurance industry

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,500
right if you think about it when it

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,840
comes to claims processing when it comes

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,650
to policy processing there are little

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,660
pieces off of processes called them sub

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,669
processes which are repeatable and so

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,460
those can be automated and we call that

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,770
remote process automation but however

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,310
you need many many people or at least

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,930
you need a swath of the workforce to be

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,910
able to then insert themselves into

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,889
those processes whether it is to scan

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,990
something to improve something from

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,449
getting those things automated as well

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,789
up to 30 40 percent whatever you know

00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:44,050
the right optimum level is that is

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,270
really relies in to and that's what

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,680
cognitive capabilities covered so we're

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,330
seeing this across this horizon one two

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,010
and three faces excellent now that

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,900
sounds like a lot of that too is really

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,870
for people in the enterprise workforce

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,430
to understand how they adapt to some

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,270
these process

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:03,330
as revolving yeah absolutely so there is

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:06,420
an element of upskilling right right and

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,820
there is an element of adoption right

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,130
which begins with openness and begins

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,660
with education and awareness and so we

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,610
are evangelizing all of that in the

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,710
marketplace as well through thought

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,660
leadership you know in addition to

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,370
providing professional services in

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,020
products as well fantastic

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,640
I'm going to be speaking later of acumen

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,110
of Luke and I'm referencing one of the

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,540
Deloitte studies actually in my talk

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,970
that about some of these in the impact

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,450
on HR I'm really really impressed with

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,580
what what your organization's been doing

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,900
are there any takeaways or

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,880
recommendations you could have about

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,800
people here for people here at strata

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,600
absolutely I come with a strong message

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,430
from Deloitte we are the number one

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,580
professional services firm and the

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,680
reason I say that is multifaceted we're

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,230
seeing market research companies such as

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,790
God consistently year-over-year putting

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,260
us right at the top right quadrant when

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,480
it comes to business analytics data

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,430
modernization cognitive capabilities as

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,930
well that's number one number two we

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,310
have incredible number of thought

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,320
leadership from our internal

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,280
organization as well which is going out

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
and spreading the message and

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,120
evangelizing the message right and

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,150
number three the proof is in the pudding

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,220
we have year-over-year tremendous growth

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,600
when it comes to revenue and

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,640
profitability and they're seeing that

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,410
you know that that seal of approval from

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,150
our customers in the marketplace all

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,860
taken together they are the number one

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,710
professional services firm and I'd like

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,009
to leave that message extra thank you

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,069
very much okay

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,069
