	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
I'm Roger McGough liz here at the strata

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,309
conference in New York 2018 I'm here

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,809
with Madhu Kochhar who's the vice

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,440
president of product development

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,780
analytics at IBM welcome thank you so

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,910
you're working in analytics and yet it

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,119
seems to be a bigger space than just the

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,420
analytics and that data governance

00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:27,330
compliance so forth really matters so I

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,640
kind of what's driving do you think the

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,570
users today and the data scientists and

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,280
so forth yeah and a great question as

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,559
we're talking with large enterprises

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,410
right I mean IBM works with large

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,000
enterprises and everybody out there is

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,920
in process of digital transformation

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,390
modernizing their stock right because it

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,710
has been a very monolithic architecture

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,660
has been built we're living in a land of

00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,710
self-service right where business

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:02,010
analyst data scientists are needing the

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,820
access to the data so what's happening

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,380
out there is it's like data scientists

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,479
in order for them to build the right

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,750
models to infuse the machine learning

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,880
and to get to the the next generation of

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,970
transformation they need access to the

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,640
right data they and it's not just the

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,000
access to the data but also make sure

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,180
there's their quality is there

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,570
data is classified right based on their

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,670
business terms their taxonomy that they

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,290
can really truly trust this data because

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,720
once you build these models and they go

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,270
into production and if it's garbage in

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,860
it's gonna be garbage out and so what

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,750
I'm finding and discovering as we're

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,490
talking to large clients is that their

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,280
journey to transformation and

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,640
modernization is not moving fast enough

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,759
because they have not done good

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,969
practices around data curation around

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,240
governance no longer governance is now

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,030
just a compliance story right this is

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,340
like governor's todaro type of a story

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,229
where you need to be able to create the

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,679
right data be able to trust the data I

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,739
have the quality of the data

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,049
so Athan the business users the business

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:15,519
analyst and the data scientists can have

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,829
easy access to that data

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,680
trust that data and be able to you know

00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:23,230
go models and then that helps clients

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,659
with their monetization rather quickly

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,209
and drive future insights so that's

00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:30,280
where the whole governance play is

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,409
painte playing a key key role it's

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,049
becoming like a glue so to speak you

00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,629
know in terms of their bedrock systems

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:43,090
where data is and driving to the

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:45,790
insights so how how is ml infused to

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,650
operationalize data duration it seems it

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,120
seems like that's actually a clever and

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,790
a great way to handle what's a tough

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,470
problem yeah yeah it is a tough problem

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,989
and what I said earlier the reason

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,870
enterprises are sort of stuck because

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,879
it's a it's it's a manual process right

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,950
think about it you know if first

00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,310
figuring out where does all my data

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,310
reside data discovery is difficult and

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,560
then in order to classify the data

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,660
somebody has to sit there manually and

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,430
you know data stewards right they have

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,989
to go do that job so this is truly a

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,060
place where a lot of automation through

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,940
machine learning can be done and that is

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,389
very re and IBM in analytics been very

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,389
focused on how easy I can put up machine

00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:35,109
learning algorithms where I can look at

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:38,260
your metadata

00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:41,319
I can understand based on your metadata

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,299
in terms of what classifies everybody

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,370
got business glossary so we're using a

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,319
lot of machine learning algorithms to

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,799
make your just data discovery better

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,870
data classification better and I'll

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,669
share with you an example I was with the

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,810
large enterprise recently with a large

00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:02,139
insurance company they have hired about

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:05,349
30 data stewards and it took them more

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,970
than six months for one application to

00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,980
do data curation you know

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,650
and when we came up with our solution

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,140
with machine learning that six months

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,019
got down to literally weeks and days you

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,959
know so that is where the speed in order

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,200
to get to the insights faster is driving

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,230
us to get two ml which leads us to our

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,680
AI story right and for the clients to

00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,220
quickly have the trusted data so to

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,440
speak

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:38,440
so using ml so that you can do ml yeah

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,850
let it but it comes down to yeah I'm

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,940
almost surprised that more people

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,220
haven't really jumped on that so that's

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,190
one aspect and we all know how tough it

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,810
is to get the data taxonomy is organized

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,810
and so forth what about things like

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:58,270
privacy and gdpr yeah yeah you know so

00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:00,550
GDP I ran in May 25th was it and its lot

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,490
it's it's not just any other regulations

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,590
right it just there's a lot of a coming

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,810
into it in terms of your personal data

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,460
your sensitive data and that's becoming

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,410
huge it's not just a European thing

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,480
right I mean a lot of businesses doing

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,660
business since Europe have to go through

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,300
that process so what we have done in

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,340
analytics we understand a lot of

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,710
industries right we understand financial

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,410
industries we understand retail industry

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,900
so we have models built in and obviously

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,180
we have GDP our taxonomy very well

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,919
understood and based on what I was

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,930
talking about earlier with our machine

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,020
learning algorithms and matching it's

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,760
very easy now to identify and actually

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,100
in our run of our products as a cool

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,250
dashboard where I can get this the whole

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,960
world map and within your enterprise

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,080
because of machine learning I can

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,390
identify where in your enterprise your

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,760
sensitive data your personal data your

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,980
GDP are related data lies so this way

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,780
you can then make the right calls and

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,510
this thing and it's a huge thing and

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,430
today is GDP are Roger tomorrow it's

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,520
gonna be some other regulations coming

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,310
right and and we have to enable

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,180
enterprises

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,200
they don't spend months building their

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,480
taxonomies to match for those

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,940
regulations so we are actually are

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,710
announcing a lot of offerings machine

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,140
learning infused where I can read the

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,540
doc you have a regulations doc you know

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,880
I don't know pages and pages of of this

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,490
thing you know and it can ingest the

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,740
documentation we have machine learn your

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,350
models built against every industry or

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,270
every regulation very quickly to infuse

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,490
machine learning and quickly get to the

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,830
answers and say watch out for these

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,170
these things in your business so a lot

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,120
of work happening there and GDP are

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:48,090
other than the privacy is also about the

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,980
security right it's like who has who can

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,770
access this data

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,690
do I have consent have I given consent

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,360
how do we manage all that in your master

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,910
data management and then understanding

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,370
the lineage where did this data came

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,740
from who touched along the way a lot of

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,740
these things are now built into the

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,300
offerings and and and we have to

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,300
automate these things right otherwise

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,580
it's just gonna take months and years do

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,890
to get yourself GD P are ready or any

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,690
other regulations that sounds great

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,970
sounds like you guys are addressing the

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,060
kind of the infrastructure that's needed

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,830
to help make the promise of M L on AI

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,830
