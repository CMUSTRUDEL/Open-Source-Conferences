hi I'm Roger McGough Louis here at

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,720
strata 2018 in New York City and I'm

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,690
here with Armour Amidala who's the

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,080
founder and CTO of cloud era welcome

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,210
thank you now last year at at strata you

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,550
talked about the automation of decisions

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,279
mm-hmm pretty big subject do you think

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,650
enterprise have gotten any better at

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,390
moving in that direction they are we're

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,240
still at the beginning to be honest we

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,039
are still absolutely at the beginning we

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,669
typically draw a pyramid of the

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,579
hierarchy of needs slash readiness of

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,809
organizations to really reach the top of

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,750
the pyramid which is automation of

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,590
decisions and there are so many

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,329
foundational stuff you need to get

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,640
through first before you can reach that

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,050
and I would say 90% of the world is

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,789
still down here right they're still

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,579
trying to figure out how do we have

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,149
smooth data collection frameworks how do

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,379
we have smooth storage and cleanup of

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,260
the data and transformation of the data

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,940
just normal analytics like you'd be

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,640
amazed at how many organizations are

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,500
still down in that and in that part of

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,670
the pyramid but the the top of

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,680
department which is the automation of

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,200
decisions or more commonly referred to

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,119
as AI I would say maybe 10 percent of

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,010
all customer based I would truly call as

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,290
well I mean that's impressive stuff that

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,670
you're doing ok just to reinforce we

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,470
said before is that at dinner last night

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,479
when everyone said getting the data

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,759
ready yeah and organized is still their

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,729
number one job exactly I think that's

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,490
still true yeah so you're looking past

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,650
the hype are there you know what are the

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,790
tangible real-life applications for this

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,759
new world of AI so it really is the

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,500
automation of decisions so by that I

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,040
mean collecting data around how we as

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,570
humans make decisions and then use

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,829
machine learning to automate some of

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,409
that not all of that but at least

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,659
automate the repeatable repetitive stuff

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,390
so for example one of the most popular

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,719
use cases that truly illustrate that is

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,450
JP Morgan where chief Morgan have a

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,780
system called coin Co I am can't

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,460
remember the exact acronym understand

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,470
coin

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,960
and what they did is they looked at the

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,850
contracts that their lawyers have been

00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,250
reviewing with their partners over the

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,860
last couple of decades and they were

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,920
able to replace 400,000 lawyer hours

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,530
going forward with just the machine in

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,740
10 seconds reviewing that 10 seconds

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,570
sorry

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,740
10 minutes reviewing the contracts and

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,200
doing the amendments and doing the

00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,970
changes for all the repetitive stuff now

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,520
the lawyers still get invoked but they

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,320
only get invoked for the there is no

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,880
precedence as something new we never

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,530
knew how to handle this in the past and

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,870
now we need somebody to intellectually

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,239
judge this to make to make a conclusion

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,590
so that's one example which I think

00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,900
really speaks to the automation of

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,120
decisions another one comes from one of

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,830
our winners from yesterday we had a

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,870
ceremony like the Oscars but the Oscars

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,060
of big data we call it the data impact

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,250
Awards and the Commonwealth Bank of

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,620
Australia they won one of their words

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,020
and they have many many use cases but

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,670
one of the fun uses they have is they

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,950
looked at the agents that they have in

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,959
the actual physical branches and some of

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,150
these agents about five percent of them

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,920
are really really good at selling

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,180
mortgages when a customer comes in

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,320
looking for a mortgage that you don't

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,780
leave until they have a mortgage in

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,610
their hand from these agents but only 5%

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,190
of the agents are able to do that

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,959
the remaining 95% are not even close to

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,470
being as good as them so what they did

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,450
is they heavily instrumented these 5% to

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,830
look at what they say the way they ask

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,330
their questions the way when the

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,510
customer responds back how do you

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,070
respond back to them they automated them

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,480
everything around them and and then now

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,150
using machine learning they're able to

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,390
push back recommendation scripts to the

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,410
remaining 95% to get the average

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,180
performance of these agents to be much

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,920
much higher now the human is still there

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,079
to convey the message but they're really

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,209
being told what the message is depending

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,670
on the data of the customer and what the

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,410
the more advanced agents would have set

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,640
to deaf customers so these are the

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,470
examples happening around this

00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,820
everywhere in every field not just yeah

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,410
both of the examples I picked right now

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,540
are banking but this is happening in in

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,280
healthcare it's happening in agriculture

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,780
it's happening in manufacturing and it's

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,850
happening in construction you name it

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,079
all industries are trying to look at how

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,299
their engineers their lawyers and

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,060
doctors are making decisions and how can

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,430
we take the the best thought process of

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,989
the best of the humans and automate that

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,030
it's not the kind of a classic

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,160
augmentation story yeah absolutely not

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,080
replacing but yes making people better

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,430
it does drive efficiency I mean if you

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,169
look at the global scheme of things it

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,180
does Drive more efficiency which means

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,490
the there is some replacement taking

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,520
place but it's not full replacement

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,370
right right so you've mentioned some

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,340
examples but what are some like cloudera

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,630
use cases of machine learning and AI I

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,100
mean both of these are taught that are

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,110
use cases so both of these that I

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,150
mentioned we're done using the cloud era

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,000
platform now we internally a cloud that

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,300
I we also preach and do what we preach

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,340
so we have a customer 360 platform

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,919
internally where we collect all the data

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,900
around our customers so the finance data

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,550
from the finance systems the sales data

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,280
from the sales force systems we use

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,610
sales force the customer support data

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,990
coming in from the support systems that

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,430
each of our customers as the running our

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,650
software it beacons back information

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,270
metrics around these clusters that we

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,849
also collect and then using that

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,889
internally we are very capable of

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,680
predicting who are the customers that

00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:25,039
are now more likely to expand or more

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,690
likely to start a new use case so that

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,449
we can proactively reach out to them and

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,039
convert them faster in a sense this is

00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,570
automating the decision of the

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
salespeople right so of menteng our

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,349
salespeople with this brain that's

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,699
sitting behind them is telling them and

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,919
now it's time to go and have that

00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,810
conversation that's great now a bit that

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,729
helps inform this what you are able to

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,289
tell that your customers exactly that

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:48,470
you make the process much more efficient

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,699
and much more faster yeah normal so we

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,650
know from our own research that the

00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:53,960
cloud is well it's been around for a

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,210
while is increasing lis popular yes

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,460
right so why is cloud era going all-in

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,070
on the hybrid cloud because our name is

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:08,349
caldera so we have the cloud in our name

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:11,330
we I mean some public stats first about

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,220
25 to 28 percent of our customer

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,800
workloads are already running in the

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,690
cloud but still I mean the flipside of

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,190
that is that the majority and more than

00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,289
a majority of our customer calls are

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,229
still on premise right so a lot of the

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:26,510
back office critical data needs happen

00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,990
still within organizations the cloud is

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,150
getting more much more active

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,620
more on the front-end applications as

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,770
opposed to the backend back-office data

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,920
but even that also started to shift as

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:41,940
evidenced by this 25 to 28 percent so

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,590
our vision of the future I mean this

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,200
gives me on the renter and sorry to do

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,970
this but right away its first I actually

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,890
don't like the term public cloud people

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,980
use it it's a it's a genius marketing

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,810
term by Amazon a juror and other public

00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,890
clouds because when he goes Disneyland

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,870
and you pay them money to go to

00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,730
Disneyland do we call the public park no

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,740
it's not a public park it's a paved park

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,120
right that you that you can go to so in

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,440
the same sense public clouds they don't

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,810
really public clouds they're paid clouds

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,640
that you can leverage if you write that

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,480
to your advantage so that's number one

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,930
number two is our customers are our

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,040
warning want to avoid the mistakes that

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,600
they have done with some of the mega

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,000
vendors of the past and I'm gonna pick

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,430
on IBM specifically so IBM was very nice

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,500
100 years ago but as you started to

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,690
embed much more deeper with their api's

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,790
with their proprietary logic and build

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,440
all of your apps on their platform you

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,820
become locked in and when you become

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,650
locked in that's when you lose all

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,840
leverage in terms of negotiation for

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,160
pricing you have to pay whatever they

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,080
say because were you to go and rewrite

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
all of that will take forever so our

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,040
approach is as we take customers to the

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,750
cloud we want to enable for them the

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,120
hybrid aspect meaning that you can move

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,290
the workloads very easily yes you still

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,419
have to copy the data which has some

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,010
logistics but at least the workload the

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,780
applications you no need to rewrite them

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,419
you can move them from cloud one to

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,250
cloud two to on-premise and almost all

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,470
of our customers are totally bought into

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,460
that yes that makes sense I don't I want

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,720
to learn from the mistakes of the past

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,910
that I have done what some of these mega

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,590
vendors and make sure that as we now we

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,810
architected our platforms for the future

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,640
meaning the cloud that we retain now the

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,200
ability to have leverage in terms of

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,390
rising it doesn't mean that I want to

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,560
move away from Amazon I love Amazon I

00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,330
want to stay for him as I'm just picking

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,370
Amazon here as an example but I want to

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,110
have the option if Amazon ever were to

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,660
come to me and say hey my pricing now is

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,090
up by 50% do tell them and no I'm not

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,979
gonna pay 50% and and being able to

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,360
confidently say that mm-hmm

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,400
that's why we're all in hybrid cloud

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,260
great that sounds great 15 years of

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,599
making great progress on both the cloud

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,209
and the AI front oh absolutely so thanks

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,390
a lot for before before we wrap up I'm

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:43,990
Betty key point

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:47,020
I'm sorry to do that is is also not just

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,520
ml and cloud but one of our key areas of

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,520
focus and in fact our biggest

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,920
money-making part of total right now is

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,260
our data warehousing aspects as well and

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,420
we did a we did a rebrand recently where

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,880
we used to call it analytical DB was the

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,770
name we used but we found that most

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,020
people don't think what is analytical DB

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,370
they three think data warehousing so

00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,590
right now we're very active in terms of

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,410
our data warehousing initiatives as well

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,750
so ml cloud didn't we have some great

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,640
you know I worked on data warehousing

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,160
when it was called data warehousing so I

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,620
goes aware yeah everybody fits her very

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,610
well you know cool okay well thanks

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,170
again for talking to us today

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,170
