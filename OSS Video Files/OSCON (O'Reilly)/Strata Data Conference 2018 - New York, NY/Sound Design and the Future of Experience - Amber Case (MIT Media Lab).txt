Title: Sound Design and the Future of Experience - Amber Case (MIT Media Lab)
Publication date: 2018-09-13
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Sound is one of the most commonly overlooked components in product design, even though it’s often the first way people interact with many products. When designers don’t pay enough attention sound elements, customers are frequently left with annoying and interruptive results. Amber Case outlines several methods that product designers and managers can use to improve everyday interactions through an understanding and application of sound design.

	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,629
so how do we change this how do we have

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,589
some principles of sound design for

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,570
products we could use better hardware

00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:11,160
instead of just the cheap square wave

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,630
that we've used an alarm clocks we could

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,880
use something slightly more interesting

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,210
like a sawtooth wave we could use a

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,859
higher higher bandwidth speaker so that

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,859
we can actually make a soundscape in a

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,430
hospital having more frequencies

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,050
available in speakers is like having 26

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,820
letters in an alphabet instead of two

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,099
letters like we have right now with all

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,540
of our cheap devices so we can start to

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,239
open that up and start to embed

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,739
information with a composer into these

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,710
spaces so we can be attune to more

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,030
information embedding more information

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,160
and sounds is used in particle physics

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,629
you don't want to look at all of this

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,670
data all the time there's so much

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,379
information how do you compress it into

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,449
a different sense so that you can do

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,520
something else and then hear something

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,680
strange using your you know your brains

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,410
latent imagination being able to listen

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,180
to that and then be able to act on that

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,500
oh there's an interesting particle event

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,570
that happened I hear that in the

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,470
background now I can switch my attention

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,090
I'm not always stuck to the screen sound

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,530
is a differentiator in products the

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,330
Dyson hairdryer versus the typical

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,310
hairdryer was a big improvement and how

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,270
they did that is they worked for four

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,250
years to improve removing sound from

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,040
their product so what causes noise and

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,570
products component fit in a nice car

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,100
it's going to be quieter than a cheap

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,090
car because the components fit together

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,189
better containerization there are these

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,409
thousand-dollar Blendtec blenders that

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,150
you see at Jamba Juice's and the reason

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,100
why those were built was because the

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,500
workers and the people who are buying

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,850
the Jamba Juice were so annoyed by the

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,590
blender sound that they started

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,270
container izing the sound they put the

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,100
motor in a container and they put a

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,009
plastic container around that and then

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,439
they put some they reduced all the empty

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,600
spaces in the container and then they

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,640
put some vibration absorption underneath

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,229
it and this thousand-dollar Blendtec

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,060
blender actually became this a very

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,159
successful product because it was

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,590
quieter than a normal conversation it

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,049
allows us to live alongside our products

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,940
a lot better we can use these principles

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,239
for all of the things we hate in our

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,890
lives from noisy hotel rooms to leaf

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,960
blowers and semi-truck engines and

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,390
apartment floors and HVAC systems these

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,700
are all compromising our ability to

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,990
relax things better and be more

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,990
interested in our environments

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,500
