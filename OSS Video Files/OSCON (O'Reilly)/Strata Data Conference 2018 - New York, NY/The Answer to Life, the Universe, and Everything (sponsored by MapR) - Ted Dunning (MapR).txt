Title: The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything (sponsored by MapR) - Ted Dunning (MapR)
Publication date: 2018-09-12
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Thereâ€™s real value in big data and more waiting when you add real-time, but to get the payoff, you need successful deployments of your AI and data-intensive applications. You need to be ready with your current applications in production but must have an architecture and infrastructure that are ready for the next ones as well. Ted Dunning explores how others have fared in this journey.

well I'd like to talk to you a little

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,790
bit about putting things into production

00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,920
but also the answer to life and

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,780
everything else

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,690
the real value from data if you're going

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,820
to get that value only comes when it's

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,770
in production when the data is in

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,900
production when the processing of the

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,480
data is in production and you've heard

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,769
from our competitors the guys in blue

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,420
just how hard that can be

00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:33,290
there's value to be had in finance

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,120
there's value to be had in agribusiness

00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:39,480
there's value to be had in all kinds of

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,050
machinery and time-series analyses but

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,870
an awful lot of people don't get there

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,520
they miss out they miss out for a whole

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,340
number of reasons but there's kind of

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,379
this storm that occurs whenever they

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,989
start to try to do this done wrong you

00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:00,780
can have some serious problems and

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:05,060
Gardner had a survey a year or two ago

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,720
which indicated that only about 15% of

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:13,110
the big data systems are in production

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,000
and that really tweaked me because in my

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,460
experience with the customers I work

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,979
with virtually a hundred percent or in

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,990
production so I started looking at what

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,830
is the difference what is the secret

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,659
that means that those people have a very

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,720
very low percentage in production and

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,409
the people I talked to have a very high

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,259
percentage and one of it big differences

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,340
is differences in expectations within a

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,869
single organization if you talk to IT

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,530
organizations they'll tell you that

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:49,020
DevOps is the devil's work you could see

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,689
it in the name everybody just does

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,470
whatever and there's no repeatability

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,880
and IT gets blamed for everything

00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,909
that's the story you hear but if you

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,969
talk to business units they say DevOps

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,729
is an absolute requirement we can't have

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:09,690
everything being frozen and change

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,629
control exploit capriciously now both

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,010
sides are describing the same problem in

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,220
a very cement

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:21,480
intrical and opposite fashion they are

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,090
describing the same things and I've seen

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,799
very very different results from what

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,159
you've heard about earlier today I've

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,290
seen customers with years of uptime

00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:35,280
literally zero downtime I've seen

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:38,790
thousands of nodes big clusters run by

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,220
three people and they don't even have a

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,859
call rotation anymore because they never

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,319
get a call it's okay for everybody to be

00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:48,629
on call that's great if you ever do get

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,269
a call everybody's on deck I've seen

00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:54,359
hundreds of applications running on a

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,480
single platform that sort of

00:02:54,359 --> 00:03:00,209
multi-tenancy is an under-recognized but

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,159
a really crucial route to production

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,560
because it allows you to make use of

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,470
sunk costs and of course you have to

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,109
have a system that supports that native

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,400
light I've seen customers have a native

00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:18,780
integrated data fabric that extends

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,359
across 50 or more data centers and has

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,419
seen them implementing with any language

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,160
even languages I've never heard of that

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:31,669
work out of the box because of standard

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:36,389
api's so we need collectively a new deal

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:38,370
based on new technology IT needs to have

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:42,449
that repeatability and that

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,699
repeatability is key to the world

00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,280
definition of an IT organization which

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:51,750
is they cannot scale their people

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,660
resources in response to scaling what

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,090
they deliver so if it takes three people

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,030
to run five nodes it should take about

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,120
three people to run a thousand that

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,549
that's sort of scaling to a proportional

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,919
number is not acceptable now if we

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,650
change those thousand nodes into two

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,280
hundred five node clusters clearly it

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,139
will scale so IT is going to need that

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,989
repeatability they cannot freeze change

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:23,099
on the other stand the business units

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:26,639
absolutely do need that flexibility but

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,870
they cannot produce mayhem we need to

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,060
draw a line

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,820
a line of abstraction a line of

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,530
responsibilities that makes this true

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,860
how are we going to do that we have a

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,650
huge range of applications that need to

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,530
be built and they have a huge range of

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,669
requirements this is a nominal sort of

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,889
thing with a few of different

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:52,410
applications the first column might be

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,410
specific you ice the second column might

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,199
be data science the third one might mean

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,250
scaling or something like that and

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,520
everybody's going to have different

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,460
takes on how that's going to be but the

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,850
last two columns the ones which talk

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,830
about moving applications around

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,110
distributed process management and

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,479
moving data around distributed data

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,240
management are going to have very very

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,210
consistent requirements so it makes a

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,510
lot of sense to factor this complex

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,000
requirements matrix into something

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,949
simpler where you provide application

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,770
management as a service and data

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,810
management as a service now

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,360
the heir-apparent the the clear winner

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,000
in in the application management space

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,750
is kubernetes in many different forms

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,639
and i think there needs to be and i'm

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:49,740
clearly biased i do i bleed red there

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,130
needs to be a solid data platform under

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,470
this now this can feel kind of

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,800
overwhelming because whole new things to

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,010
learn and it's especially true when you

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,830
try to do things practically because

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:08,220
kubernetes by itself just punts the

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,310
issue of state we really really need a

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,949
way to handle that we need some way to

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,169
manage these applications that have

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,180
state and data that outlives those

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,650
applications that has a different life

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,270
cycle we need that data platform there

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:31,320
what we need is something that's like

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:34,590
kubernetes but for data well that's

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,440
actually what we provide and I've cast

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,090
this as a view of the future but in fact

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,280
this is our past for the last ten years

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,860
we've been building exactly this thing

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,070
and for the last seven years we've been

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,500
delivering it so if you'd like to hear

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,389
more about this I'd love to hear your

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,389
thoughts I'd love it if you could come

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,010
visit me at the malabar booth and in

00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,139
particular I'd love to talk to you about

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,169
some of the offerings we have which

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,270
currently based on based practice and

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,970
years of experience helped people deploy

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,139
models help them manage models help them

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,580
monitor them and identify opportunities

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,950
I'd also like to invite you we're gonna

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,410
be signing our latest book which is

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,540
talking about bringing AI and analytics

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,030
in production but you can get our older

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,430
books sharing data safely like dan

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,650
lorica was talking about we have a book

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,500
from a couple of years ago on that model

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,600
management machine learning logistics

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,479
management we have a book from last year

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,100
about that we'd love to provide that

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,250
sort of thing to you you can download

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,150
these all pretty much for free at map

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:47,419
our and we'd love to help you put these

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,160
things into production help you with the

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:53,900
answer to life the universe and

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,770
everything along with your data so thank

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,459
you very much

00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,459
