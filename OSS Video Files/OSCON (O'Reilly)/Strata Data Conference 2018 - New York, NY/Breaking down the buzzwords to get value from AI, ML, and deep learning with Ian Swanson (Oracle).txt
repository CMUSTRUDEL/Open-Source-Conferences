Roger McGough is here at strata New York

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,390
2018 I'm here with Ian Swanson who's the

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,980
vice president of artificial

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,349
intelligence and machine learning at

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,259
Oracle welcome he's lovely so it's been

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,859
an exciting year getting acquired your

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,869
old company data science was acquired

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:20,970
tell me about it once again yeah it was

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,609
it was a great year we started data

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,410
science comm nearly five years ago and

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,420
we started with the principle of

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,910
companies need to extract value from

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,830
their data and so we built a platform

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,420
for data scientists that had the tools

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,120
that they needed in the compute power

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,879
access they needed to build to access

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,770
data build models and put models into

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,280
production Oracle acquired the company

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,700
in May of 2018 and we're thrilled

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,250
so why Oracle honestly is because

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,230
alignment of vision data science com

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,610
we're built for enterprise customers and

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,170
you think about Oracle you think

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,329
Enterprise the other thing that was

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,649
really exciting for us was all the great

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,530
stuff they're doing in terms of cloud

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,559
compute so again alignment of a vision

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,689
and truly innovation that's great an

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,100
Oracle is just named as a leader in the

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,740
machine learning and predictive

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,689
analytics platform wave you know can

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,610
provide some insight into that yeah so

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,640
Forrester did a wave that got announced

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,259
just a short while ago and Oracle was

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,970
was a leader and there's there's two

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,400
acts these points that I'm proud of that

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,200
Forrester ranks on one is the current

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,900
product and one is around the strategy

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,729
on the current product again we have a

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,240
leading platform we have large companies

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,130
that use it to not only you know access

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,290
data and build models but really to get

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,320
models into production and drive value

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,759
from their data on the strategy that's

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,340
something I'm really excited about I

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,380
think there's a lot of new areas where

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,479
we can move beyond just doing data

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,250
science and consuming and using data

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,799
science we got to break down the

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,840
barriers of AI machine learning deep

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,399
learning away from just buzzwords and

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,229
make it so that lines of business

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,450
understand what are the capabilities

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,189
from their data science teams and how

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,930
can they use those results and that's

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,600
going to be some key areas of strategy

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,170
for Oracle yeah so you're talking about

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,940
trying to get value from from the data

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,290
and so forth and from an organization's

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,400
what did it but it

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,620
kind of challenges and what are the

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,930
opportunities there there's plenty of

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,209
challenges from a challenges perspective

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,859
it's one access the data on clearly

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,930
being part of Oracle we have a lot of

00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:27,780
data we have access the data the next

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,659
one is compute power so data scientists

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,370
oftentimes need large compute power to

00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,659
build to do the analysis the training

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,730
the building of the models that they're

00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,620
doing and so being part of a

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,290
infrastructure company like Oracle we're

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,909
leveraging OCI Oracle cloud

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,219
infrastructure to give that compute

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,799
power the next piece is how do we

00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,409
connect from a data scientist creating a

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,359
model to the business unit using it and

00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,329
so we're able to in a very intelligent

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,650
way create models behind API endpoints

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,079
that can be consumed by the business

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,720
these are all areas that are common

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,599
challenges in the data science lifecycle

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,599
that we're really making more efficient

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,180
here in Oracle great anything you see

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,389
coming down the pike for your space and

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,739
your company I think you know and I'm

00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:16,290
talking about this later today at strata

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,930
it's not just about doing data science

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,139
it's about consuming data science and so

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,019
many of the conversations that I really

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,849
enjoy lately are not just with data

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,120
scientists machine learning engineers

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:32,310
and IT and app developers but again it's

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,260
with line of business and it's educating

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,180
line of business of what is possible and

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,340
how can they consume these results to

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,260
drive everyday decisions and I think

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,299
once we educate and would get everybody

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,010
working together as a team at that point

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,799
we can truly achieve digital

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,319
transformation yeah I think you're right

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,299
there the process is just as important

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,919
asking the right questions is just as

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,680
important as any of the tools I think

00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,400
underneath yep so great well thanks for

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,569
your time today

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,569
