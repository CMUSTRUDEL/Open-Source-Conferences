Title: Black Box: How AI will Amplify the Best and Worst of Humanity - Jacob Ward (CNN | Al Jazeera | PBS)
Publication date: 2018-09-13
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - New York, NY
Description: 
	For most of us, our own mind is a black box—an all-powerful and utterly mysterious device that runs our lives for us, using rules and shortcuts of which we aren’t even aware. Jacob Ward reveals the relationship between the unconscious habits of our minds and the way that AI is poised to amplify them, alter them, maybe even reprogram them.

but what bad habits will AI amplify

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,919
that's the question that I worry about

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,450
and I'm gonna give you a couple of

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,620
habits that I think are sort of worth

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,859
thinking about so in Casino Royale James

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,060
Bond likes to say you don't play the

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,279
hand you're dealt

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,289
you play the man across from you right

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,920
which is both incredibly stupid and

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,109
absolutely correct

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,699
because it turns out and this is again

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,230
based on the work of Kahneman and

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,759
Tversky and then all kinds of work that

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,380
came out of it they had a classic idea

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,329
called prospect theory that then created

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,280
this idea that we don't hang on two

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,230
probabilities very well it basically

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,540
boils down to this the human mind can

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,460
handle only five probabilities when you

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,800
and I are told well there's a 30% chance

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,140
of this and 70% chance of showers and a

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,090
little bubble we can't handle that it

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:57,449
turns out we can only handle five and

00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:04,199
they are 99 percent 1 percent 100

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:07,560
percent 0% and 50/50 that's it that's

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:12,659
all your brain can do and so we will

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,939
also do anything to move 99% to 100%

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,500
this is the essence of travel insurance

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,729
and the insurance they try to sell you

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,100
on things that you order in the mail

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,320
right your brain doesn't like 99% we're

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,560
sort of allergic to uncertainty but

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,680
we're not actually doing the math well

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,960
I'm seeing this tendency the the

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,970
tendency to believe that we somehow can

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,770
handle probability and the fact that a

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,470
corner of the research our brains really

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,180
can't handle it at all playing out

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,229
already in the artificial intelligence

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,979
base so a company called epic built this

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,890
probabilistic AI system for Louisiana's

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:54,119
largest healthcare company Ochsner

00:01:49,890 --> 00:02:00,229
health and they are using it on in in

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:02,460
cardiac wards to help guide the cardiac

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,180
interventions basically that the doctors

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,610
on their rounds and using machine

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,730
learning just using the statistical

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,260
probabilities from past patients they

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,930
say okay at this

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,959
you know this this patient in this room

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,420
has a let's say 87% chance of

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,180
deteriorating in the next few hours now

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,769
I don't want to beat up on this system

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,590
it's actually working incredibly well

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,790
it's reducing cardiac codes they call it

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,709
when you actually go into cardiac arrest

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,769
it's having an incredible effect on it's

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:38,069
a very positive effect on patient

00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:40,400
outcomes but I'd also like to point out

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,840
that showing even a trained physician

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,549
something like an 85 percent probability

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,790
or a 79 percent probability or whatever

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,859
it is doesn't actually translate into

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,690
anything more than either 100 percent 90

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:55,590
percent 99 one percent D represent or

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,989
50/50 and the people at epic and the

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,280
people at ochsner have both told me that

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,049
they have to be pretty careful about how

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,359
they calibrate the percentage that is

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,310
delivered to the physician because it if

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:07,799
it's too low they ignore it and if it's

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,900
too high it becomes sort of an emergency

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,519
we don't have any kind of calibration

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,150
for that so in in essence they're

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,049
delivering a binary decision a go/no-go

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:22,079
kind of decision to the physician and to

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,030
me I think that is that is it's good in

00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,599
this case but I'm not sure it's always

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,599
going to be good

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,280
