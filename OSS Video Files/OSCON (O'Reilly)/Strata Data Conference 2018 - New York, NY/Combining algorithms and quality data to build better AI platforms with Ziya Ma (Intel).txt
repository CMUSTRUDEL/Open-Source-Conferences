I'm Roger McGough us here at strata New

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,540
York 2018 and I'm here with Zia MA who

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,250
is the vice president of the software

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,059
and services group at Intel welcome

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,710
thank you so while this is a data

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,350
conference it's also a lot about what's

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,359
going on with ml and AI machine learning

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,100
and artificial intelligence I said spill

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:26,430
it out what do you see happening in that

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:30,480
space Oh data and AI you know Roger I

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,910
think one mostly recent trend is the

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,829
closer and a closer integration of AI

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,989
and and data analytics I know there has

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,680
been a debate for a long while whether

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,039
it's more important to improve AI with

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,510
data or improve AI with better

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,480
algorithms given that you have a

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,210
reasonably good algorithm it is usually

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,850
more important to have more data and

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,470
high quality data and we can look at a

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,330
couple of examples the first example is

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,590
image net you know even last a couple of

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,140
years we saw that the great advancement

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,290
was computer vision and image analysis

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,890
that advancement greatly benefited from

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,850
the appearance of large public data set

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,950
like image net so in this case a big

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,380
data set like image net to really help

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,350
to with the the AI advancement for image

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,000
analysis another example is Google you

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,530
know Google is getting into the medical

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,920
field and they are especially interested

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,770
in doing automatic analysis for

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,890
pathological radiological and

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:49,049
microscopical images now Google already

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,040
have our good algorithms we all know

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,710
that so what they are missing is really

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,259
good data so in the last few years ago

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,149
goal has been talking with the different

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,869
hospitals and medical centers trying to

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,060
have access to the good clinical data so

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,129
you know this also explains why we're

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,880
saying closer and closer integration of

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,740
AI

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,470
data analytics together because by

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,680
combining the two we can solve much more

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,800
complex problems than what we couldn't

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,500
do before so I think that's one biggest

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,160
trend we're seeing great now you brought

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,650
up platform AI and Apache spark is

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,390
emerging it's kind of a leader in this

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,400
space can you tell me more about what

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,550
Intel is doing to help support that

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,830
effort oh definitely you know Intel has

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:43,350
been and one of the the biggest enabling

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,630
effort for Apache spark actually since

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,700
the the Apache spark was just an

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,400
incubator projects over the years we

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,860
have done a lot of optimization for

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,860
spark on Intel platform from our silver

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,840
technology to our storage technology and

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,200
recently were working also with a

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,740
sparkle community on optimizing spark

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,630
for obtain persistent memory so a lot of

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,340
work happening over there but especially

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:14,780
in machine learning and data analytical

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,370
space you know we also have done a few

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,370
open source projects with last year we

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,230
open sourced big deal the ANA this year

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,710
will open source to analytics ooh now

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:29,280
using big deal as example this is a

00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:33,450
project that we created organically on

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,910
Apache spark it has implement and more

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,470
than 200 layers of neuro network well I

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,170
I know actually it has feature parity

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,700
with cafe tensorflow torch and a few

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,550
other popular deep learning frameworks

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,240
the the biggest benefit of big deal is

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:55,110
that it works similarly with distributed

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,800
data by driving Hadoop and spark as the

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,560
unified analytics and AI platform giving

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,709
customer the consistent and integrated

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,830
pipeline from data ingest to data

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,830
storage data management feature

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,390
engineering machine learning and then

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,340
deep learning deep learning inference

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,790
deep learning training the entire

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,950
pipeline and also you know for customers

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,299
it helped you reduce the total cost of

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,330
ownership

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,910
because previously you know customers

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,550
had to set up a separate infrastructure

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,949
just to do model training and after the

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,710
model is trend you have to bring the

00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:37,650
trainer model back to your existing data

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,900
analytics tag and make sure it can

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,880
integrate with the rest of the stack and

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,039
to derive business insights from the

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,550
data but now all that it can be saved

00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,020
you can do machine learning training you

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,910
can do deep learning training deep

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,550
learning inference and deriving insights

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,460
from the data using the trainer model

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,919
all from the one data analytics

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,530
infrastructure so that's another big

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,340
benefit with big deal and in the last

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,530
couple of years we have worked with many

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,169
customers including top cloud service

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,710
providers like Amazon Microsoft Google

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:16,740
and Alibaba and I do and a few others to

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,229
include a big deal on Intel platform

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,840
into their cloud offering we have also

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,530
worked with the top ISPs like data

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,990
breaks like cloud era and bulu data to

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,729
integrate big-deal into their products

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,440
and of course we work with many

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:35,159
enterprise customers from different

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,669
segments including retail financial

00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:40,880
services industry healthcare energy

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:43,710
manufacturing and many more to build

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,159
spark and a big deal based deep learning

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,509
applications on Intel platform so kind

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:51,030
of related at platform but I'm gonna

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,560
have to read this at your keynote this

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,360
morning you announced a new type of

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,539
memory innovation called the Intel

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,919
obtain DC persistent memory how does

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,469
that work with the whole you know the

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,560
data analytics and AI space yeah sure

00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:07,979
you know we have been working in the

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,940
data analytics and AI customers for a

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:14,460
long time now and especially in recent

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,150
years many customers they want to look

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:21,360
for options to accelerate the data the

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:25,650
analytics or to accelerate AI for

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,349
example deep learning training and quite

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,260
often they need to either cache the data

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:32,870
or they need to catch the

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,000
model parameters but into the memory but

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,360
a memory constrain has been a constant

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,090
challenge our customers face so we

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,220
worked in the last few years we worked

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,820
with the customers and we put a lot of

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,100
work around in place just to address the

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,560
the memory constraint so for example we

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:55,340
may you know sacrifice computer for

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,500
memory we may use the sparse data

00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,750
management to reduce the consumption of

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,600
memory but that's all very you know

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,810
awkward and limited an option that we

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,760
have so this is why Intel this year

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,390
announced Intel op Temper system in the

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,720
memory because that really give us a

00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:17,870
good solution for the memory constraint

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,960
it's based on the revolutionary it's 3d

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:24,830
crosspoint technology it combines the

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,680
the speed of a traditional memory like

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,980
deer on and then with persistence and a

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,060
capacity of storage and so now customers

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:37,550
can have unprecedented high capacity

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,530
persistence and affordability um you can

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,840
extend your system memory by more than

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:48,260
three TB Pabon a per CPU salted that's

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,270
like significant and we not only just

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,040
the hardware itself like always we

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,320
deliver a fully optimized a software

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,190
stack on top of it from optimized

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,200
operating system to driver software to

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,510
runtime and an anti virtualization to

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,690
optimize the data platforms like Hadoop

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:08,030
and spark and we tested on a few

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,810
applications with some of our partners

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:14,570
so using a spark Seco as example spark

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,530
Seco using persistent memory can have a

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:21,290
x performance gaming over all for

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:24,050
decision support workloads and Apache

00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:28,530
Cassandra that's a very

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:30,719
at ad-hoc query intensive application so

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,750
Apache Cassandra can have nine times

00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:38,669
throughput one using persistent in the

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:41,190
memory over PCIe SSD now ASAP Hana I

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:45,269
know recently SMP had a blog published

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:48,779
it for s AP Hana was sixty bit data if

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:51,810
you're just using a server with Duran it

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,950
takes you fifty minutes to restart but

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:59,220
if you use a persistent memory and D Ram

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,470
it on a server the restart is only four

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,079
minutes so that's the second if acun are

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,620
we already seeing a lot of passion from

00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:10,649
our customers and partners for using in

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,470
obtain a persistent memory so and we

00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:18,060
actually we have started shipping and

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:22,320
they're the the revenue selected it

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,180
actually revenue chips for our selected

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,220
customers and then we will have the

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,079
broad availability in 2019 great

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,810
it sounds like anna cells are pretty big

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,579
increases in performance yeah so let's

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,790
add a personal level you are a leading

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:39,720
woman executive you're a big data

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,100
technologist

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,589
you are a founder of the woman in big

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,019
data forum what is your assessment of

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:51,149
how high tech industry is doing in terms

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:53,190
of diversity and inclusion well first I

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:58,140
definitely I see very encouraging

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:59,130
progress in diversity development in the

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,250
last few years

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:05,160
first let me put it this way I think the

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,519
industry is recognizing it is important

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,029
to have diverse team it's not just the

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:15,329
right thing to do it also brings

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:17,550
competitive advantage and I you know we

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:21,930
work with many customers and online

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:25,550
retailers are just one of them and many

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:28,160
online retailers today they collect data

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,410
I tried especially collected their

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,130
customers shopping behavior data and

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,440
they use that data to analyze and then

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,760
to understand what is the customers

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,920
preference and then they make more

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,290
relevant product recommendations to the

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,980
customer and maximize the customers

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:49,220
purchase potential and they found out if

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,019
the user diverse team and diverse team

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,050
can to collect more accurate and

00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:56,360
complete data for the customer shopping

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,130
behavior they tend to make more relevant

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,140
and more personalized product

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,649
recommendations and in their business

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:06,170
outcome is more competitive so you know

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,990
and with businesses in recognizing the

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,640
benefit of having diverse team and many

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,240
companies have started doing something

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,430
to improve their diverse workforce and

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,079
again using Intel as example you know we

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:24,230
put a lot of energy into recruiting and

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,779
retaining and diverse employees and we

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,880
also put a lot of effort building an

00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:31,339
inclusive environment we want to make

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,990
sure no matter who you are and when our

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:35,839
employees come to work they really

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,060
really enjoy the environment and they

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,270
bring the true selves to the work

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,800
environment and we also have very strong

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:47,800
connections with different universities

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,810
and academia just to build our diverse

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,149
pipeline so those are them and you know

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,750
another example is I look at the

00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:58,970
strategy at a conference I was here the

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,709
previous years and I'm here this year

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:06,680
and I also noticed a more and more a

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:09,410
woman and diverse participants and

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,079
speakers at this conference so all that

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,730
you can see all the encouraging signs

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,160
but on the other hand we still have a

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,459
lot of work to do you know we'd like to

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,380
see more diverse people to move into

00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,899
this field this is such a fascinating

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,360
and faster growing field we want to see

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,010
more people take advantage of that the

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,170
the growth opportunities here and

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,600
working together I'm sure we can make a

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,550
difference great well thanks for your

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,390
time thanks for the interview well thank

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,390
