the stratas like the I describe it as

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,010
the CES of data I guess it's an easy way

00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,809
for me to keep up to date with what the

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,790
hype is or what I needed to currently

00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:16,219
know about I get to see like all the

00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,700
latest innovations in one place it's

00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,900
like a crash course or what's happening

00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,330
[Music]

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,269
it is really good that we get to hear

00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,890
this instruction from the people who are

00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,509
responsible for writing the technology

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,640
the speakers are those who are

00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,170
responsible for actually developing this

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,760
technology so that's quite impressive

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,410
and you don't get that everywhere

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,880
last year I noticed there's a big focus

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,950
from streaming and this year there's a

00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,540
big focus on applications machine

00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,550
learning and so being able to keep a

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,140
pulse on that helps us stay relevant the

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
biggest opportunity at strata is that

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,050
you know you it's a tremendous platform

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,510
to meet all of Experts

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,240
was specific to an industry medical

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,890
research you know aeronautics patel then

00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,260
so on and so forth a lot of best

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,060
practices you know which you get access

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,010
to and of course you know it's a great

00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,200
platform for networking so I'm hiring

00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,929
and I was able to network to some of the

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,240
people over the lunch as well as like

00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:12,979
her in the parties so it has been

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,469
awesome I mean I came to know about a

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,469
lot of people here as well as in some of

00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:20,119
the other locations where definitely we

00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:22,939
don't go and don't meet them often right

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,530
so it definitely it is going really good

00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,530
and I'm enjoying every bit of it

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,570
I'm very new to the industry so I'd like

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,070
to speak with the you know some industry

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,560
professionals who've been here for a

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,170
while and who had the chance to mentor

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,970
me and in areas that I didn't

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,380
necessarily have an expertise in they

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,000
taught me how they scaled their

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,619
businesses they taught me about how they

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,539
manage their own internal workplace

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,399
politics and for someone who kind of

00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:52,049
just got onto the field of college it's

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,729
not really complicated because you think

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,220
of a Big Data and all this stuff it's

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,509
complicated but when I when history so

00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,909
what people are doing and how they did

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,350
and how they started it's really not

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,000
complicated is the biggest you know I

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,069
didn't expect I would be learning so

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,690
much but now like as I go through the

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,090
conferences like different sessions

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,120
definitely learning a lot great

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,209
experience a vendor I met at the show I

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,519
think will solve a problem I'm about to

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,650
have to solve so that might be a pretty

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,160
good relationship superstar to go back

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,160
and pitch nut

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,990
[Music]

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:40,449
you

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,449
