you might be looking at this title and

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:11,610
saying what is this guy smoking but it's

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:15,420
true if you look at you know pizza it's

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,840
a vegetable by our regulations two

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,529
tablespoons of tomato sauce counts as a

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,570
vegetable so if your child consumes a

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:27,660
slice of pizza that has two tablespoons

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,740
of tomato sauce he or she had the

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,140
serving of a vegetable that's what our

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,090
regulations have so today in the next

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,489
five minutes I'm going to take you

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,559
through how you you can use machine

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,309
learning and AI to decode those

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,700
regulations not only understand but use

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:51,449
it to your benefit in enterprise just to

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,140
give you an impact into the challenges

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:59,840
that regulations bring this is what it

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:04,290
is eighty-one thousand pages since 2015

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,750
billions of dollars in GDP are think

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,510
about it folks I mean if you are a small

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,400
business or an enterprise how do you

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:18,479
make sense of all these regulations not

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,799
just that look at this the regulatory

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:27,600
data is all unstructured so it comes in

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,729
flow charts tables texts you name it now

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,750
you as an enterprise have to make sense

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,670
of it so here to take you through the

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,619
scenario you know I created a

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,369
hypothetical company called Akamai food

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:45,420
supply what a Kamiya does is it provides

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,570
food snacks to kids you know schools in

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,420
Northern California these are the

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,000
businesses especially the small medium

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,299
businesses that is going to get most

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,070
impact from these regulations how do we

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,030
deal with it how do they create

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,200
knowledge out of this enterprise

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:09,959
so we built something called IBM Emilia

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,610
IBM Emilia is built using machine

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,000
learning deep learning and NLP

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,250
we have pre-trained Emilia with the

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,080
regulations from different state local

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:27,760
and federal governments and it can speed

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,710
up compliance so I'm going to for

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,180
example I'm going to take one of the

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:36,400
regulatory PDF load it into Emilia and

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,880
this is what you get a bunch of garbled

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,850
ago how do you make sense of it our

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,050
lawmakers lobbyists and lawyers have a

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,480
style of writing these documents Emilia

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,350
using recurrent neural Nets have learned

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:57,570
that style now all of a sudden instead

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,570
of regulation Emilia gives you knowledge

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,250
so the first step here is that once you

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,570
load the document Emilia looks for

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,620
regulatory terms and if you are a

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:14,680
business you already have business terms

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,950
Emilia maps it to the regulatory terms

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,230
to the business terms not just that

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,450
using machine learning Emilia can tell

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,820
you of all the business terms it has

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,100
which one is most relevant to you in

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,940
this case flavored milk it can tell you

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,860
which flavored milk is relevant to you

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,020
it goes even one step higher it tells

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,730
you the relationship that exists between

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,910
the technical metadata in your

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,570
enterprise to the regulatory term and

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,120
the business terms but if you are a

00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,920
business what is the most important

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,250
thing for you the bottom line the

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,709
revenue the cost the expense Emilia can

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,900
point out that for you it can correlate

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,920
everything together it can give you a

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,190
360-degree view on what is the impact

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,290
that regulation has on your business so

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,769
in this case if you look at the right

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,720
hand bottom corner there is a red mark

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,000
where Amelia says now you have a new

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,459
business opportunity where you can start

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,830
selling 1% flavored milk to the

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,959
enterprise's I mean to the schools so it

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,229
obviously not only learns about

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,350
regulation it comes back with new

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:29,170
opportunities it gives you an avenue to

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,330
ties on the regulation so all of its

00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,490
certain the challenge of the regulation

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,610
has become an opportunity for you and

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:40,000
that's what Amelia does so if you want

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,520
to learn more about Melia and other AI

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,150
tools that we are built please come to

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,740
terminal 5 from 5:30 to 9:30 and we

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,150
would love to have you there thank you

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,540
so much

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,540
[Applause]
