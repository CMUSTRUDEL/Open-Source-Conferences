Roger McGough was here at strata in New

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,350
York 2018 and I'm here with Ashish

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
Burmah who's managing director of

00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,340
analytics + cognitive I like the plus

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,210
sign who's going to talk to me about the

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,160
age of width so what is the age of width

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,320
it's interesting you asked Roger it

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,880
because you know if you look at what

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,600
we're talking about when we say the age

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,220
of width for us it translates to a few

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,320
different things in the world of

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,529
computing today so today if you were to

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,910
look at humans in conjunction with

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,130
technology the things that they're

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,559
attempting to do it's reimagining what

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,210
was possible and when we talk about the

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,550
age of it that is what we imply and we

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,730
give you examples shortly about it but

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,410
in reality it's also about you know the

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,059
whole hype about humans replacing

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,030
machines it's not really about humans

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,199
replacing machines it's it's about

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,930
humans and machines working and waste

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,910
together to uncover things that we're

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,250
not done before right and if it's but

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,109
it's about innovation or or new ways of

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,809
doing things you know all of those

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,909
possibilities and we also think of this

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,850
is is what has always been true about

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,970
you know wit and the power of humans and

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,020
web and it's to the core of many of the

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,520
inventions that we don't even think

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,080
about right where there was Henry Ford's

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,540
assembly line couldn't have been done

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,640
alone with just the fact that we had

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,380
Industrial Revolution right it needed

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,970
humans with machines to get to that so

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,310
that's pretty much what we are talking

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,979
about when we talk about the edge of it

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,950
the power of you know human innovation

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,420
with the with cognitive technology to

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,220
bring us to something that is possible

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,540
that couldn't have been done before so

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,729
it sounds like kind of an augmentation

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,340
approach that's direct instead of a

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,659
replacement that's correct right so it's

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,700
a lot aldeman tation as opposed to

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,860
replacement okay so the general you're

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,229
talking about this kind of helper

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,270
function but specifically how does it

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,840
relate to kind of data architecture and

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,860
analytics yeah I'll give you some things

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,299
that are pretty apparent in our

00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,490
portfolio and probably start to make

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,280
sense so most clients that we work with

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,079
today the data footprint is roughly

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,590
doubling in a period of eight to twelve

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,569
months eight months if you're curating

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,569
external data sets those that originate

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,360
outside your organization

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,459
plus what you do internally and ten to

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,410
twelve months if you are just mining the

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,440
footprint of new sensing and signals

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,510
that you want to do for data analytics

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,090
so if you were to look at the volume of

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,130
what data is happening within the

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,500
ecosystems of most organizations is to

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,360
double the volume then you started with

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,239
within the timeframe of less than 12

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,340
months the crux of the issue here is is

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,930
if you look at how legacy analytic

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,569
applications were both they were both

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,360
towards humans curating data set by

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,750
domain to derive insights which is no

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,730
longer a reality to be able to attempt

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,769
to do in any organization so when we

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,299
talk about you know voluminous data

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:55,549
that's being accumulated through all

00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,989
these external sensors that's the kind

00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,470
of architecture footprint that we're

00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,329
talking about

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,160
well you don't rely on human beings

00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,290
alone to curate all the data sets into

00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,640
its meaning independent of where you put

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,250
it right so you know whether the

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,750
destination is a cloud or whether the

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,610
destination is an on-premise head of

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,069
distribution independent of those I

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,349
think what is about to happen and we

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:19,160
have a few bots that actually do this is

00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:20,870
is be able to curate data services from

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,829
and data engineering from a source

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:27,139
system to our own or DBMS or or our file

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,819
or whatever it may be to a target state

00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,109
and that could be a file that could be

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,090
an our diplomats that could be Hadoop

00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,940
that could be s3 that could be hive

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,739
table built with the perception on the

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,079
fact that if you're going to attempt to

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,660
do this sort of experiment with this

00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,489
kind of volume or digital FTE to start

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,870
some aspect of that curation is probably

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,090
a reality and that's what we're talking

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,859
about now it's highly unlikely that a

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,389
hundred percent of the engineering data

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:52,670
engineering and pipeline can be written

00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,950
by a bot or a digital FTE like we speak

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,150
about but it's it's quite possible that

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,620
you should be able to attempt to do

00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,319
thirty to forty percent of that on an

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,430
automated task right which sort of

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,040
begins to make sense when we talk about

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:07,040
with you know humans with technology

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,739
mm-hmm Wow just if it does any

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,109
documentation of what columns and tables

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,730
appear would just be a great feature

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:14,480
because I know engineers often leave

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,709
that too

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,709
I'll never get to it

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,110
so you've described the kind of how this

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,940
all works you have any examples with

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,669
customers of how this is being

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,250
implemented in practice sure so you know

00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,080
we I'll give you a few few examples that

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,300
probably start to make sense so we were

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,699
working with the beverage manufacturer

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,280
and we did something to the tune of

00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:41,889
about 15% ROI

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,419
just by automation or something that

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,610
we're doing with human middleware right

00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:47,530
so if you can think about sort of the

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,990
kind of capital that that frees up for

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,669
an organization which has you know so

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,370
one known fact most most idea

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:56,680
organizations or call centers right and

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,330
and the pressure on economics and total

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,970
costs of operations to do something

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,490
better cheaper faster everyday reality

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,020
for most CIOs so that's sort of an

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,820
example of where we were able to take

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,259
15% through automation which in order

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,720
would have not been possible if they

00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:13,300
continue down the path there's a

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,539
provider for which we basically got rid

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,819
of 20% of their costs its cost to

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,710
provide care just through simple

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,210
coordination of what happened in the

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,539
back-office through the different

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,580
components of the care that is provided

00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,900
and then you know we we talked about the

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,250
airline industry all the time and you

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,560
know some of the stuff that we do and

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,060
some did who do themselves but you know

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,219
just virtual agents from the standpoint

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,409
of when they communicate to you through

00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,639
a smartphone or an app to turn around

00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,199
say your flight is delayed because

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,360
you're you know a frequent flier

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,430
customer and that's you know how we

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,560
provide service so I mean if you look at

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,449
these examples you know it's big name

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,340
the threads are the story line of what

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,199
is possible through something that's

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,090
rules or process intensive that can be

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,940
automated right so that is sort of one

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,130
kind of cognitive which is sort of you

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,680
know what we call the you know the

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,870
horizon one of cognitive right not still

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,789
not autonomous still not intelligent

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,460
enough to be able to do what a human

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:11,020
mind does that's the second tranche that

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,969
we that we talked about which is where

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,349
all of this is headed and to get to that

00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:15,880
second tranche I think it's pretty

00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:18,280
evident that you're probably going to

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,990
have to first and foremost get your data

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,729
analytic strategy correct from the

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,099
standpoint of being able to collect all

00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,990
of this to be able to train data or

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,080
train algorithms against that data side

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,629
so I think

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,060
that second part is what is being

00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,710
promised is what will arrive in the next

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,930
two to five years and pretty evident in

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,219
our portfolio of organizations that have

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,169
started along this journey that that's

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:41,449
probably a reality for them that's great

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:45,830
so what does the enlightened customer

00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:47,449
think about with the age of with in in

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,500
it's interesting you talk about customer

00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,180
and I'm assuming you're talking about

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,439
the joy client portfolio is it for

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,939
success I should have said it more

00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,729
generally what doesn't organism what

00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:57,710
does the enlightened organization think

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,629
in the age of with there are a few

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,250
realities for which they are the

00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,219
conversation is pivoting around first

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,969
and foremost that this is going to be an

00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,500
environment that's going to be very

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,150
hybrid from the standpoint of a

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,539
technology footprint right so whether

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,250
it's a multi cloud environment and or

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,750
it's a hybrid environment of some

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,289
promise of on-premise and cloud

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,389
technology or is it IAS for some aspects

00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:22,250
of cloud where the analytics application

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,800
works as a past service all of those

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,389
right so which naturally brings into

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
play the conversation about portability

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,740
right so multi cloud yes a great

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,050
strategy from the standpoint of being

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,669
able to have a you know for an

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,469
organization to be able to delve into

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,819
some of these challenges from a

00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,919
procurement standpoint our pricing

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,330
standpoint but you have portability and

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,699
you know people think about portability

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,680
is just about you know if I containerize

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,389
it you know I don't have to worry about

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,740
the interdependence use up to seven

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,539
different software's that run underneath

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,879
that yeah that is true but you know data

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,009
portability is a very huge aspect of

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,240
this conversation so it's a challenge in

00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,680
itself if you're gonna operate in a

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,599
multi cloud framework and you know

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,520
certain components or segments of data

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,710
reside in certain clouds how do you

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,900
assimilate and curate all of this for

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,129
the unified view for a business user

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,889
that comes from the right side of this

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,089
picture so I think you know if you if we

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,440
were to look at the challenges I would

00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,050
say target operating model from the

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,789
standpoint of figuring out in this world

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,440
of DevOps and continuous integration

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,789
continuous deployment what does the

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,080
skillset look like you know what does

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:22,849
your target operating model look like

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,589
you know how can you do automated

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,300
deployment you know how can you run the

00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,860
operations of this thing and put it into

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,319
production when you've gotten past your

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,060
is into path to being able to migrate

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,579
those applications I think all of those

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,990
are things that people talk to us about

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,279
and all the things are the challenges

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,079
that people are trying to figure out you

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,089
know what's the right answer and clearly

00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:43,979
there's not a right answer I'm sure this

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,720
range if for some answer is depending

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,829
upon what you're trying to tackle but

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,779
those are some of the things that we

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:51,750
dealt with that's great well thanks for

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,730
sharing this age of with discussion with

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,730
