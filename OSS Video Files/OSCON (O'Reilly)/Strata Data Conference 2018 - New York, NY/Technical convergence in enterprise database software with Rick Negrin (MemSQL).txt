Roger glows here at strata New York 2018

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,569
I'm here with Rick Negron the director

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,410
of product management that mem sequel

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:13,200
welcomed yesterday at the keynote you

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,490
talked about technical convergence and I

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,690
wonder what you mean by that

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,490
sure so convergence it's about taking

00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,260
specialized technologies and bring them

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,060
together and a single technology that

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,279
serves all the same functions it's a

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,570
great example of this is cell phone so

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,640
it wasn't that long ago that we are all

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,980
carrying multiple devices a PDA to

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,579
handle your contacts email and calendar

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,850
a cell phone handle voice and texting

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,340
and a camera for taking photos but as

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,690
the modern smartphone has evolved I was

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,129
able to absorb all those functions and

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,450
now we can carry a single device which

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,940
most people would much prefer because

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,370
it's easier to manage easier to use and

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,079
do all those functions in one device now

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,460
we see the same thing playing out an

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,039
enterprise software particularly in

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,329
databases over the last several decades

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,030
there's been a number of new workloads

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,469
that have popped up in addition to sort

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,690
of the traditional operational systems

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,580
there's now analytic systems stock into

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,640
databases systems that do full-text

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,960
search in memory and real time and

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,400
there's been data stores that have come

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,170
up to serve each of those functions

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,380
because people try to build their apps

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,369
now there's sometimes 5 or 10 or even 15

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,570
different components the system's it's

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,920
very difficult to stitch all that

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,630
together and make it work effectively

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,490
and efficiently and keep it up and

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,530
running and to train all your people in

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,299
order to tune and optimize it and some

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,930
people are really looking for a single

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,369
system that can do all that workload to

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,240
make it easier and simpler to build

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,619
their application and meet the

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,970
requirements and that's what mem sequel

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,530
is about or a general-purpose database

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,659
that can serve all of those workloads

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,240
greatly simplifying your infrastructure

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,009
and how you train your people and allow

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,890
you to deliver on the requirements and

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,290
SLA that you need great so yesterday you

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,280
had brought up a company called fanatics

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,920
on stage when they clearly using mem

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,390
sequel for their infrastructure is this

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,540
something that you're seeing more often

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,560
with your customers absolutely so

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,420
they're fanatics you can see on the

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,799
screen they were using about a dozen

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,670
different open-source technologies

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,500
trying to stitch them all together

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,910
trying to make it work and they're just

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,640
suffering a lot of difficulty in keeping

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,310
this thing up and

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,780
and optimized and I'm moving mem sequel

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,030
I greatly simplified their architecture

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,350
drove down their costs and simplified

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,120
how the training that to do for their

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,380
people and we're seeing that pattern

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,960
play out over and over again and a

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,150
number of our customers mm-hmm so since

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,500
Stratos San Jose which seems like it was

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,770
a long time ago but really wasn't that

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,710
long time ago you announced your series

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,330
defunding how is the how are things

00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,160
going for the company in general it's

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,209
been a great it was great round we

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,459
raised thirty million dollars from

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:42,370
Google Ventures as well as Glynn Capital

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,170
and several of our previous investors it

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,700
just really speaks to the potential they

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,380
see in the in the growth of the database

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,480
market and then the promise and mmm

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,560
sequel mmm-hmm so more recently you

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,050
announced the new version of your

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,360
product meant sequel 6.5 tell me about

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,709
it what kind of features does it have

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,390
yeah so the latest version is by far the

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,110
most powerful and the stable of the

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,310
releases that we've done so far

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,680
primarily we're focused on simplifying

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,660
the management operations and driving

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,670
down the time to insight its amount of

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,840
time it takes for data to be born to the

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,660
time you're able to pull it out of their

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,190
database and get value from it and we

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,130
did this by adding a number of features

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,519
around workload optimization and around

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,049
pipelines which is our feature to bring

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,580
a load data into the system make it

00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,190
easier and simpler to bring that data in

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,100
fast and get it into the at the right

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,680
spot as well as adding support for full

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,750
text search so rounding out the set of

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,100
data types that we support as well as a

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,890
number of performance enhancements which

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,350
we do in every release mm-hmm so your

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,200
messaging now says no limits databases

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,459
you know what what do you mean what how

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,519
does that relate to what you're trying

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:50,140
to offer yeah so it's all about helping

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,130
customers break through the limitations

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,560
of their experiencing what their

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,630
existing data stores and its dimensioned

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,489
across a number of dimensions whether

00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,290
it's about how fast the data is coming

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,030
in how fast they can query it coming out

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,690
how many number of users they're trying

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,460
to scale on the system

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,780
you know where they want to deploy it

00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,070
wherever they were getting stuck

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,320
wherever they're getting bottlenecks

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,610
we're building mem sequel to help break

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,720
through those bottlenecks and allow them

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,020
to meet their requirements in the

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,940
russell ways mm-hmm so knowing the kind

00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,070
of capabilities of in-memory databases

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,000
there's a lot of things going on just in

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,270
the world in general

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,760
MLI things being more distributed and so

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:32,600
forth what do you see coming and down

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:35,660
the pike so I see there's a number of

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,180
kinds of things obviously a a an ml is

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,170
the most recent one to come up and more

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,700
and more people are thinking or getting

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,870
involved in that it's a tough thing to

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,850
understand and so people are still

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,500
trying to get their heads around it and

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,720
they're looking for systems that can

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,280
support it naturally without them having

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,340
to understand all the intricate details

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,450
so be able to support more libraries and

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,500
functions to make it easier for people

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,950
to make you so that's going to be an

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,120
obvious one but we also see this

00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,160
convergence of analytics and

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
transactions as of one of the places

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,000
that were evolving towards where people

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,950
be able to do more of that in one system

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,330
rather than having to have data and one

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,590
operational system moving over here to

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,290
do the analytics over there

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,580
right well thanks a lot for the

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,510
interview and spending time with us

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,510
