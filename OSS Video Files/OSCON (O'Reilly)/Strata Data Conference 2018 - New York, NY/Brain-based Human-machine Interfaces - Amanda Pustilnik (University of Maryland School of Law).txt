Title: Brain-based Human-machine Interfaces - Amanda Pustilnik (University of Maryland School of Law)
Publication date: 2018-09-13
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Have you ever dreamed you could read minds? Do telekinesis? Maybe fly a magic carpet by thought alone? Until now, these powers have existed only in the realm of imagination or, more recently, video, AR, and VR games. Join Amanda Pustilnik to learn how brain-based human-machine interfaces are beginning to offer these powers in near-commercially-viable forms.

this then takes us to the next step so

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,940
okay maybe that's a problem with pain

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,490
detection or lie detection in a

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,440
courtroom that might be a smaller use

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,299
case what about if governments or

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,250
corporations decide that they want to

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,130
roll these technologies out at larger

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,590
scale that what if is actually happening

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,080
now this is a picture or a stock picture

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,529
of workers in China several factories in

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,320
China have put brain sensors EEG sensors

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,690
in the helmets of their workers to try

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,870
to detect whether they're feeling bored

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,460
angry frustrated disaffected we could

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,140
imagine that in the US this could be

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,309
used as a technique to stop school

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,020
shootings because we're a very

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,200
security-conscious country even though

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,420
we're very safe it's a compelling

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,789
argument for the use of those

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,059
technologies protect our children and

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,559
yet what are they detecting they're

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,230
detecting averages of impulses that

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,769
really in only an attenuated way to

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,840
particular behaviors in ways in which

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,580
the relationship between thought and

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,240
behavior has not yet even been

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,920
established for you know a drug addict a

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,869
person struggling with drug addiction

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,479
and recovery can crave a drug but not

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,869
use a drug a person may feel angry and

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,140
never strike someone the idea of being

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,689
able to use brain based data to engage

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,619
in prediction that is of low quality

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:34,079
that is normed against groups that may

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,869
not be representative of how I think and

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,240
feel and that may be imposed upon me is

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,180
really quite threatening I believe and

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,509
we have far fewer legal protections

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,700
against this than you might think our

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:49,049
United States Constitution does give us

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,259
a privilege against self-incrimination

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,960
but that's only for defendants in

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,869
criminal cases it doesn't apply in civil

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,820
matters it doesn't apply to any kind of

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,939
monitoring of the population at large

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,670
the Fourth Amendment only guarantees us

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,459
a reasonable expectation of privacy

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,580
we're reasonable is a balance against

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,050
danger and safety and technologically

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,700
driven by what we can

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,700
backed to have be private or not

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,180
