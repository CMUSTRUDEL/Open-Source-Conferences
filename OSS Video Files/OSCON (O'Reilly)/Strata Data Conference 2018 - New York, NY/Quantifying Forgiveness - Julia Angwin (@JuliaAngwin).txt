I saw this again when we investigated

00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,820
car insurance algorithms so we looked at

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,380
algorithms that predict the risk of car

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,509
accidents you can see a theme here I'm

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,180
into prediction risks and investigating

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,470
them so it has been long known that

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,330
prices for the same driver if you move

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,310
from one part of town that is more white

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,990
into a minority neighborhood you're the

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,490
same driver but you still you get a

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,560
higher price in those neighborhoods and

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,420
the car insurance companies have said

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,949
that they do a certain amount of pricing

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,530
just based on the zip code where you

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,719
park your car because there are more

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,219
accidents there so we said okay let's

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
test that because they're actually data

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,809
about how many a students there are

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,600
needs zip code so we went once again and

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,340
got 30 million quotes for liability

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,309
insurance which is mostly the insurance

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,840
that is required in most states and we

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,460
got a bunch of different profiles of

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,070
drivers different types of drivers and

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,780
then we went and actually looked at all

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,180
50 states and asked them what are the

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,960
risks true rate accident cost that

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,799
insurers have paid out in the zip codes

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,680
in total payouts in your state per zip

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,090
code so only four states responded but

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,640
in those four states we were able to

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,619
compare the premiums to the payouts

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,500
right so we controlled for all the

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,840
things one safe driver so that only

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,780
difference was the zip code and then we

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,240
looked at did their difference in price

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,060
really truly reflect the difference in

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,939
risk in those neighborhoods and once

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,280
again we saw that there was a weird gap

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,030
so I don't know if you can see it but

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,400
there's the straight line that's red is

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,799
the prices of in minority neighborhoods

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,770
and they are basically tracking risk

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,840
it's a linear relationship between risk

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,840
as the neighborhood gets riskier the

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,490
price gets higher the blue line is white

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,049
our neighborhoods and what you see is it

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,829
starts to track risk and then it goes

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,299
down so there's a strange moment where

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,149
high-risk neighborhoods are actually

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,200
getting under priced and that was again

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,310
a strange finding right so in truth the

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,340
white neighborhoods were getting some

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,670
kind of forgiveness what that means in

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,040
real life is

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,200
that there are these disparities like

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,959
this is in Chicago in one neighborhood

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,060
where Otis pays almost $200 a month for

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,319
his car insurance has had no accidents

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,660
he's in a western zip code in the city

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,750
where it's a minority neighborhood and

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,239
then we have Ryan who pays 55 dollars a

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,310
month in his white affluent neighborhood

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,720
near Wrigley Field even though he just

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,120
recently had an accident

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,130
same company Geico and the difference

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,769
was when we dug into their rates and I

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:48,040
don't know these are probably too small

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:50,620
but the true cost of payouts in those

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,140
neighborhoods was actually higher risk

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,930
in Rayleigh Park it was slightly higher

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,970
payouts from the insurance that's how

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,459
much they truly had to pay to cover

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,239
their risk in those areas and yet they

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:07,600
priced the minority neighborhood twice

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,440
as high as the white neighborhood so

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,080
they weren't pricing according to risk

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,390
so once again we have this gap which I

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,640
call the forgiveness gap whereas one

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,150
group is getting a break and I will

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,220
speculate that maybe there's more

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,260
competition in those neighborhoods the

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,390
insurers want to compete with each other

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,650
on prices maybe they see those as more

00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,910
valuable customers there could be all

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,609
sorts of reasons but the truth is

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,650
insurance as a product that is regulated

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:38,290
required by law you can go to jail for

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,299
not having it is actually required by a

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,120
lot to be based on risk alone and no

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,920
other factors and so since our report

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,690
came out California actually have forced

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,690
a couple companies to adjust their rates

00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,140
