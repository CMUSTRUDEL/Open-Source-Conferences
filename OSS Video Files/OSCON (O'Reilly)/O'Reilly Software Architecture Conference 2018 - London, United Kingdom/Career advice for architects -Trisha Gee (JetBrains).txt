Description: 
	Do you have any idea how to climb the ladder but remain technical? Or how to avoid being promoted away from what you love? Did you realize when you started your career just how important nontechnical skills would be or think about the other skills that would make life easier but are undervalued? And just how do you stay ahead of the curve and stay relevant?

Trisha Gee shares advice and lessons she learned the hard way while managing her career as a developer, lead, and technical advocate. She also gives you tools for working out what your next steps are along with plenty of examples of what not to do.
