Title: Career advice for architects -Trisha Gee (JetBrains)
Publication date: 2018-10-30
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Do you have any idea how to climb the ladder but remain technical? Or how to avoid being promoted away from what you love? Did you realize when you started your career just how important nontechnical skills would be or think about the other skills that would make life easier but are undervalued? And just how do you stay ahead of the curve and stay relevant?

Trisha Gee shares advice and lessons she learned the hard way while managing her career as a developer, lead, and technical advocate. She also gives you tools for working out what your next steps are along with plenty of examples of what not to do.

if you are an expert if you are really

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,769
good at what you do the best way to be

00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,929
effective is not to continue doing that

00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:14,419
one thing on your own you become a

00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:17,240
bottleneck the best way to become

00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,430
effective is to help others to learn

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,460
those skills that you have to understand

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,470
the things that you know it's much

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,020
better if your whole team of let's say

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,190
15 people can be leveled up surely

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,180
that's more effective than having one

00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,530
person who's an expert so I suggest it

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,570
the way that you can level up the way

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,760
that you can become a 10x developer

00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,550
which is the term I hate and is to help

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,010
others around you become more effective

00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,300
it's much better much more scalable so

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,149
I'm going to suggest a bunch of ways to

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,280
do this pair programming is my favorite

00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,809
way of leveling up everyone I worked in

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,879
a pair program pair programming

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:54,979
environment when I worked for L max a

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,319
financial exchange here in London when

00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:59,569
we pay a program to every day and there

00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:01,729
I learnt not only about the domain not

00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:03,589
only about different ways of different

00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,840
ways of approaching a problem and it was

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:07,280
also fantastic for having those what

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,810
we're normally inner monologues have

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,430
actually do it this way or this way or

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,170
this way or this way you can have that

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,820
with another person and you can get a

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,399
lot of insights very quickly while

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,289
you're delivering code now I know a lot

00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:20,329
of organizations think that having two

00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:22,250
developers at a laptop is a waste of

00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:23,360
time because everybody knows the typing

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,729
is the bottleneck when you're coding

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,680
right it is not so if you can't sell

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,030
your organization on this oh yes I

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,159
wanted to say as well pair programming

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,600
is not just for developers so when we

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,100
were at L max we used to pair programs

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,469
sometimes at the beginning of the story

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,170
with a business analyst a developer and

00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,719
a technical tester and this was a really

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,280
effective way of sharing the knowledge

00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,530
of what what we were trying to deliver

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,450
from the business analyst all the ways

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,759
it could be could go wrong all the edge

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,840
cases from the tester and the developer

00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,100
at the end of that would have a much

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,630
clearer idea of what they were

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,579
delivering and some of the constraints

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,259
around it so pair programming is not

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,689
just for exchanging knowledge between

00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:03,829
developers it's also for bridging some

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,009
of those boundaries between the

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:08,450
different roles inside your team if pair

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,159
programming is maybe something you can't

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,810
sell your company on maybe mob

00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,760
programming might need another approach

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,210
so get everyone together in a conference

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,240
room

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,680
so I don't know a day a week I don't

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,200
know whatever whatever suits you and

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,570
pick something to work on you can either

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,010
pick an issue to work on and you all

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,930
still get the benefits of learning off

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,640
each other you still get the idea of

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,680
seeing how other people work how other

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,270
people use a tool have a wireless

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,950
keyboard which you can throw around so

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,230
you can change your drivers and your

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,000
navigators and this might be another way

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,270
to share knowledge between everyone in

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,270
