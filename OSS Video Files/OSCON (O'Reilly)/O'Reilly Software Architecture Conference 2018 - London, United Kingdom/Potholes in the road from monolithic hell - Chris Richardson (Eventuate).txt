	Potholes in the road from monolithic hell: Microservices adoption anti-patterns

A typical mission-critical enterprise application is a large, complex monolith developed by large team. The velocity of software delivery is usually slow, and the team struggles to keep up with the demands of the business. Consequently, many enterprise applications are good candidates to be migrated to the microservice architecture. As you might expect, migrating to microservices requires an enterprise to tackle numerous technology-related challenges. But enterprises often encounter obstacles that have less to do with technology and more to do with strategy, process, and organization.

Chris Richarson details several anti-patterns of microservices adoption that he’s observed while working with clients around the world. You’ll learn the challenges that enterprises often face and how to overcome them as well as how to avoid the potholes when escaping monolithic hell.
