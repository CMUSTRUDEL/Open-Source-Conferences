Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Microservices, containers, and serverless are all the rage, especially for greenfield developments. But in these environments, you donâ€™t really know which machine is running what code, so surely these trends must have security implications? Liz Rice addresses the questions you need answers to: Will your deployments be less secure or more? How do DevOps processes like CI/CD and cluster orchestration affect your security profile? And what can we all do to minimize the risk of exploits?
