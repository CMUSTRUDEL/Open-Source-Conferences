I just think that and the things that

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,730
we're talking about here that are

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,320
extremely important becoming

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,059
increasingly important as our systems

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,379
become more complex I'm really looking

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,730
for the ideas that are here that are

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,680
going to help make it more accessible to

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,230
a larger group of software engineers my

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,180
future if you're an architect or an

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,949
aspiring architect you get to fun

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,199
presentations see the kind of challenges

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,400
you deal with in that role or tips and

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,230
tricks on how to be even better

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,520
performing in that role usually when

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,160
you're working up in a company you have

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,420
this stack and you work with and you are

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,370
blind to what's happening in the

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,260
industry so coming to this kind of event

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,460
really opens your eyes and lets you

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,410
network with other people who are doing

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,309
maybe solving the same problems that

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,960
you're having but with different

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,600
technologies different languages

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,820
different cloud platforms based on the

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,110
breadth of topics I think that there's

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,410
something for everyone

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,210
there have been very specific developer

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,719
talks there have been talks that are

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,480
rated toward a CTOs and engineering VPS

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,170
and architects obviously so it really is

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,270
something for everyone

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm a senior dad looking to get into

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,530
architecture so this has been giving me

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,180
the information that I need so you

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,770
understand what I need to do to get

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,229
there there's a lot of good learning

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,479
opportunities especially you know for

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,580
people in companies that one so

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,950
interesting challenges or that need like

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,560
cutting edge or complicated new

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,030
solutions the content is super important

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,860
I love the content but it's mainly the

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,229
chance I have for example lunch they're

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,210
a fantastic chat room blur our table I

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,130
should say full of people discussing all

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,140
ideas from hiring right through to

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,799
architectural decisions and technology

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,439
trade-offs

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,049
I keep meeting people that I see like on

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,479
Twitter like we met

00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:47,030
on a slack group and so the community

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,530
has been fantastic there's nothing like

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,479
sharing a problem sharing your

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,219
challenges sharing your successes as

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,150
well and sack on is a great place to do

00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:59,919
that

00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:59,919
