hi I'm Chris kozakowski and I'm here

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,879
today at software architecture in London

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,710
with Andrea from container solutions

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,330
Andrea welcome and thanks very much for

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,969
joining us thanks Chris thanks for

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,049
having me great could you tell us a

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,240
little bit about your background because

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,850
it's not your typical software

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,250
architecture background some insight

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,109
into your qualifications and the fact

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,529
that your passion for psychology and how

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,750
that plays out in your work well you're

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,590
absolutely right you don't often see a

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,809
psychologist on the software conference

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,700
like we have today here but it makes a

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,790
lot of sense doesn't it it does make a

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,820
lot of sense yes so yes my background is

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,850
in psychology I have a degree in

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,559
clinical psychology and I have been

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,320
working in mental health care for about

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,829
10 years I recently made the transition

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:57,270
to working with container solutions and

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:59,340
that became more apparent as as it

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,500
became the company struggling with her

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,439
hiring and I could I could see an

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,619
opportunity for me to help them out with

00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,930
my clinical background and I was able to

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,700
spot people who might not behave the way

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,840
that the company would want them to

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,830
behave so that's where our marriage

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,680
started but for psychologists to work in

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,509
organization is not strange at all it's

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,210
a bit unknown for some of the companies

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,880
maybe working in this industry but if

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,939
you look back maybe even 15 years we

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,490
could already see psychologists helping

00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:38,009
the army by selecting who is fit to be a

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,009
pilot and who is fit to you know be a

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,619
ground-floor soldier so psychology and

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,750
and work and organizations have been

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,590
working together for a very long time

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,140
already and there is a law research out

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:55,140
that has been done by psychologists that

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,860
can be beneficial for companies in the

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,090
software industry interesting yeah so

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,130
why in your opinion why is this

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,259
behavioural topic so hot why is it so

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,729
important I mean it's and for so many

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,979
companies and I know you can always

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,289
speak for container solution but if you

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,290
could speak for why this is so hot so

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,860
obviously behavior is not only a very

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,740
important

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,010
for job performance the way people

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,570
behave in more natural situations can

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,240
tell us how they will behave in future

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,360
situations so it's very important we

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,030
hire and who you hire in the end makes

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,430
your company the success you want it to

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,490
be or the team the success the team you

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,700
want it to be and now that the come to

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,490
the industry of software is so fast so

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,810
quick so high demanding we expect more

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,190
and more of our engineers maybe in

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,260
twenty years ago it was fine to just

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,290
interact with the computer and that was

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,660
fine but nowadays they need to do more

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,430
they need to be able to speak to

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,010
managers to speak to clients and

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,010
therefore having those tool sets like

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,170
communication skills we call them they

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,600
call them soft skills is very important

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,760
in order to survive in this fast-paced

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,730
industry sure yeah

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,730
so what differentiates see us in this

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,340
sense how are you OCS average bear well

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,890
CS obviously is a professional service

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,989
company so we have consult we have

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:26,540
consultants that work at companies to

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:28,769
help them improve their own software and

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,350
because they work at clients they

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,239
encounter clients that might have a

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,230
complete different vision or idea of

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,660
problem solving so our consultants need

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,310
to be able to read they need to be able

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,330
to teach they need to be able to

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,100
understand and be curious to create a

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,220
sense of understanding of the problem

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:54,120
they find when they enter a new client

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,350
so being able to do that have all these

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,299
skills these communication skills

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,459
problem-solving skills those are not

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:07,340
things you would normally find in a

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:10,470
university case so psychologists and

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,660
across the board other industries have

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,730
been helping making these development

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,269
plans

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,729
development professional development

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,160
plans how do you grow and that's

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,109
actually what I offer on a daily basis

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,090
that contain a solution okay do you feel

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,610
like you've made a positive impact on

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,240
the culture and container solutions and

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,889
yeah

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,620
I'll preface that with I'm of the belief

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,509
that the culture is the absolute most

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,139
difficult thing to change about any

00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:40,830
organization so culture is already very

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:43,580
abstract sure I mentioned what is what

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:48,530
is your culture and we try to define it

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:51,180
from from a perspective that we like to

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,009
what I did in my talk I talked about the

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,699
learning organization a culture of

00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,800
learning or feedback giving of openness

00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,370
about taking them the best out of

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,440
everyone

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,180
all right so how can we help each other

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,130
to be the best mm-hmm

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,630
you could call that a high-performance

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:13,259
team so helping people takes a lot of

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,930
effort making people improve investing

00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:19,139
in people and that's what I do that's

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:22,169
what I help people the engineers with

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,669
our container solutions with so I do

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,500
one-on-one coaching

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,199
I have developed a leadership program

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,940
which actually addresses these

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,729
competencies that they need to develop

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,449
in order to do their job at the con at

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:37,889
the client but also to help their own

00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:40,800
colleagues at work to become better

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:42,360
great so we've been at it for a few

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,520
years here with software architecture

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,960
conference and I'm guessing that you're

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,930
one of the very few clinical

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,030
psychologists if not the only who's ever

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,500
presented what does that mean to you to

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,820
present here is how was your experience

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,630
you just got done with your session

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,150
right I did I did so it was a huge honor

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,610
first of all to be asked I've been

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,389
working in this industry I know I've

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,289
been getting to know more engineers and

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:12,659
this is not my first talk on a software

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:15,360
conference and every time the responses

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:17,400
are fantastic people love psychology

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,880
engineers love psychology they have this

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,069
huge hunger and thirst for for the

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,110
things that I know so it's been an

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,630
absolute fantastic opportunity to speak

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,419
here and share the things that I know on

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:34,710
my field with the rest of of this

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:37,770
industry I think both of those fields

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,410
can completely work together and improve

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,410
a lot of things when it comes to the

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,180
technology that is moving fast and

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,699
that's impacting a lot of people's lives

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,020
at the moment that's great well we're

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,479
thrilled that we were able to give you a

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,759
platform to you know help spread the

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,530
word and I really appreciate you taking

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,599
