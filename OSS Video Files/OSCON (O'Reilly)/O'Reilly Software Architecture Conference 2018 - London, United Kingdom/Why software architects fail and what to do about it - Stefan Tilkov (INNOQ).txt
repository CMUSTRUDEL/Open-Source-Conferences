Title: Why software architects fail and what to do about it - Stefan Tilkov (INNOQ)
Publication date: 2018-10-30
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	We’ve all seen them: ambitious projects that started out with grand visions and ended up as costly lessons in what not to do, leaving behind the ruins of promising paradigms, technologies, tools, and careers. But why do architecture approaches sometimes hurt instead of providing value? Why has “architect” become a negative term for some people? And what can we do to improve our own work? Stefan Tilkov looks at some of the most common pitfalls that ensure you’ll come up with a disaster and explains how they can be avoided.

	00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,390
so the first one is what I like to call

00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,370
overgeneralization Drive and I'm pretty

00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,110
sure that everyone here who does

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,960
architecture has heard about that one

00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,740
the symptom is seen commonalities which

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,140
is a good thing

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,180
generalizing things which is also a good

00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,510
thing but doing that to a degree that

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,390
it's not that is not healthy and if

00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,350
you're an old person like me you might

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,359
might have observed that in your own

00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,390
personal life I know what I have so

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,789
looking at it as phases in a developer's

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,739
life when you start out you're very

00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,929
enthusiastic about that whole thing it

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,940
feels really good to you because you

00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:40,280
finally get to apply what you learned

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,679
during your training courses university

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,899
school whatever right this is cool

00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,089
cool stuff so finally let's build no

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,249
longer examples but let's build real

00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,809
things for real people I mean it get

00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:53,949
hired by some company and you find

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,949
yourself doing something like this

00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:00,170
boring stuff and you come to this

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,469
conclusion you have this epiphany that

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,980
what people do is boring and you enter

00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:09,650
phase 2 the disillusion developer now

00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,420
this is where developers and those who

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,420
have an architectural spring split right

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,820
um architects look at this and notice

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,300
well there is something interesting here

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,310
which is this I mean this is generic

00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,020
write generic solutions are a very cool

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,910
approach to this whole thing so why not

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,250
turn this into a generic unit to a

00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,340
generic thing and become an enthusiastic

00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,960
architect now this is where you spend

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,570
the next four years building this

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,130
generic machinery this mechanism that'll

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,960
help you solve all the problems of the

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,730
world and then you learn that that's

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,500
maybe not the best approach because what

00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,540
you built may not ultimately end up

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,550
being something useful so you learn

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,530
about all those things like keeping it

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,470
simple and you ain't gonna need it and

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,360
approach it from lean perspective and

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,500
maybe build a minimal product first and

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,940
don't try to build something that will

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,310
take care of all the requirements that

00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,470
may or may not arise a decade into the

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,479
future and maybe focus on individual

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,850
stories that deliver value to actual

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,869
clients and you become a disillusion

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,729
architect now that's that's making it a

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,260
little bit too extreme and don't think

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,069
that it's really actually the case but

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,019
if you look closely at your cell

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,969
and the architects around you the people

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,950
who do architectural work this pretty

00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,750
old quote from a fantastic article by

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,879
Jules Falls do you think that's about 17

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,950
years old now talks about architecture

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,590
astronauts people who are so far removed

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,060
from anything that's that's breathable

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,489
from anything that's in the real world

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,530
that they built these things that nobody

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,659
can really put to any good use but that

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,909
makes sense on their own right they

00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,560
create this universe of things that

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,959
nobody in the real world is connected to

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,790
so don't read their architect hopefully

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,280
in the end you become the wise architect

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,700
right somebody who looks at a question

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,579
any question really and answers it with

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,650
the same answer you could also call it a

00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:58,129
consultant answer right that's that's

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,129
