Description: 
	We’ve all seen them: ambitious projects that started out with grand visions and ended up as costly lessons in what not to do, leaving behind the ruins of promising paradigms, technologies, tools, and careers. But why do architecture approaches sometimes hurt instead of providing value? Why has “architect” become a negative term for some people? And what can we do to improve our own work? Stefan Tilkov looks at some of the most common pitfalls that ensure you’ll come up with a disaster and explains how they can be avoided.
