hi I'm Nikki McDonald content director

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,680
at O'Reilly and I'm here today with

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,230
Marco Palladino co-founder and CTO of

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,660
Kong hi Marco it's nice to have you here

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,580
today hey there thanks buy me here okay

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,980
let's start by having you tell us a

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,140
little bit about what Kong what Kong is

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,050
and what it does yeah so Kong it's a

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,390
open core platform to intelligently

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,880
broker the flow of information within

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,080
the enterprise and our systems break

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,349
that down for people who might not be

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,680
familiar with how it all works

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,059
so we're transitioning to a place where

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,460
lots of services are going to be

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,320
communicating with each other within our

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,469
systems we're transitioning away from

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,910
model debt to micro services and as part

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,940
of that transition we're moving away

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,320
from having one system to having

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,329
multiple different services

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,449
communicating with each other and so

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,949
when that happens we have bigger flow of

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,539
information going from one service to

00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,579
another as opposed to have all this

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,309
information within the monolith in a

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,920
data pool so so talk a little bit more

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,530
about you know the industry trends

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,880
you're seeing right now in this space

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,060
there are primarily three trends that

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,860
we're seeing one of them is that in fact

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,720
the information is going to be in flight

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,210
moving forward from one service to

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,250
another and so the questions are how do

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,960
we connect these different services how

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,360
do we protect them how do we get a sense

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,490
of these architectures moving forward

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,530
the second trend we're seeing is that

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,610
we're entering a cloud native world

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,840
we're entering a hybrid world where

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,790
effectively it's not going to be just

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,430
one architectural pattern it's going to

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,930
be all of them together depending on

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,150
what kind of business value are trying

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,340
to achieve you know architectures change

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,310
but one of the questions we should ask

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,140
ourselves is why are they changing and

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,310
the answer to that is that our business

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,140
requirements are driving that

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,520
transformation so depending if you're

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,680
trying to find a product market fit

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,110
depending if you are trying to scale our

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,560
systems we might adopt one architecture

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,750
or another and the third trend is that

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
we are seeing an explosion of different

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,459
services within our systems within the

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,110
enterprise so it's going to be thousands

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,880
of different services talking to each

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,800
other in

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,110
that changes everything oh yeah

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,330
definitely so so where does confident do

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,630
all these new trends how does how does

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:26,150
Kong where does it fit yeah so can't

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,490
help developers to connect these

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,740
different services to protect them to

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,840
extend them and then get the sense of

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,180
all of these moving parts across

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,350
different architectural patterns

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,080
effectively we deliver what we call a

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,010
service control platform which is a

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,050
control plane that allows you and

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,940
developers to get visibility on top of

00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,480
each one of these different services and

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,510
patterns and applications and then helps

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,730
getting business value out of them by

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,190
helping developers to effectively

00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,710
self-serve their services and find those

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,120
services and communicate them and

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,810
consume them and extend them and protect

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,970
them and so on

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,860
so where do you see things moving next

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,840
you know what's next for the industry

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,490
although it feels like you know

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,200
containers and micro services are still

00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:18,140
very new like some people we already are

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,120
topping them but many still haven't what

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,060
do you think where do you see industry

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,240
going forward you know the industry so

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,800
far has been very I call it tribal it's

00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,900
either one programming language or

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,990
another it's either one architecture or

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,940
another what I'm seeing is that

00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:37,790
pragmatically enterprises are moving

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,620
towards a hybrid world programming

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,940
languages don't matter anymore as long

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,310
as we have an interface that we can

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,320
consume an API it doesn't matter how we

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,850
build our services likewise

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,140
architectures don't matter anymore

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,390
depending on what kind of business

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,610
requirements we have we might adopt one

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,160
or another another trend as a matter of

00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,740
fact is server lies and functions as a

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,940
service right we're moving towards a

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,280
world where do is first of all greater

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,140
importance in open source technologies

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,760
open source is drug is driving all of

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,100
these transformation think of darker

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,140
think of kubernetes think of you know

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,930
Apache Kafka think of elasticsearch

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,410
think of Kong even the key word is open

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,180
source

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,590
it's a bottom-up transformation that's

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,209
happening developers adopting

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,610
technologies and putting them in

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,070
production and then what we're seeing is

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,120
that around these open source projects

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,680
we are seeing ecosystem

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,900
self-service ecosystems that are growing

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,120
around these projects that help those

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,250
developers buy into a specific trend

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,590
into a specific architecture and then

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,479
grow from there so what is it going to

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,400
take we were talking a bit before and

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,860
start an interview what is it going to

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,340
take for an organization culturally to

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,800
make this work like what kind of like

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,150
infrastructure changes they have to make

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,970
from a staffing perspective

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,800
yeah these changes in these trends that

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,850
we're seeing are not just technical

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,680
technological they're also operational

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,320
organizational and even cultural in a

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,050
way the organization has to evolve on

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,300
each one of these aspects in order to be

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,220
successful building modern architectures

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,979
or perhaps even adopting micro services

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,510
or server lies the way our teams are

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,889
going to be working are going to be

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,360
working within a micro service-oriented

00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,760
architecture is going to be different

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,240
than in a monolithic architecture the

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,250
way culturally we're going to enable

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,740
these teams to be successful is also

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,260
very different so it's a transformation

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,110
that's touching pretty much every single

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,130
aspect of the organization you talk a

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,830
little bit of what the what the

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,690
differences are and between a team

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,280
that's running a micro services versus a

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,860
team that's running a monolith like

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,690
what-what needs are there how does that

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,880
how does it what are the pain points and

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,039
how does it have to change yeah so for

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,990
example in a monolithic architecture we

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,330
have large teams working together on the

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,159
same code base whereas as we transition

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,740
to micro services we're seeing more and

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:03,770
more smaller teams so called pizza teams

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,020
right in a way you know we're decoupling

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,810
our software and we're also decoupling

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,389
our teams our teams are becoming as

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,789
decoupled as distributed as the software

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,889
building and so the way these teams

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:18,169
start working with each other the way

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,360
these teams on board on each other's

00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,460
service and the API is going to change

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,380
for example the importance of

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,090
documentation within internal systems

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,050
documentation now becomes such an

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,810
important factor

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,330
if documentation is not up to date how

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,610
will a team be able to consume one of

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,729
those thousands of services that you

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,260
know that he finds within his you know

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,480
organization it's going to be impossible

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,280
to do that and so the way this

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,590
teams are going to be working it's going

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,840
to change to reflect that when we talk

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,240
about micro services we also in the

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,480
industry talk about dependencies between

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,640
different services well it's not just

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,390
that it's also dependencies across

00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,560
different teams right so it's

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,780
understanding how all of these maps

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,610
together within the organization it's

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,290
going to be critical moving forward no

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,370
one enjoys creating documentation I

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,760
think that's going to be a big challenge

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,770
to getting but so necessary with all

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,260
these moving pieces like you say that is

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,940
correct and not necessarily the

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,650
developers the individual developers or

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,750
individual teams are going to be doing

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,340
that we're seeing more and more

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,520
artificial intelligence and machine

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,920
learning into these systems obviously

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,360
managing thousands of moving parts and

00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,100
they're just going to get more and more

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,500
complex over time it's going to be

00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,230
different than managing a monolith right

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,020
and so these new technologies machine

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,030
learning for example can help us how to

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,860
generate that documentation perhaps or

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,390
being able to get a sense of all of that

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,520
it's nothing look forward to

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,750
I believe looking forward to things what

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,660
are you looking forward to this week

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,030
it's not for architecture well I'm going

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,800
to be personally speaking about micro

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,620
services the talk it's called

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,750
you know practical micro services so I'm

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,400
going to talk about the transition from

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,140
monoliths to micro services and the

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,890
dangers that this transition you know

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,810
hides within but it's also a chance for

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,680
me to get a sense of the overall

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,530
industry trend

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,750
I mean conferences like this one where

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,760
we have industry experts and Enterprise

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,310
architects joining it's a great way for

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,500
me as well to understand what's the

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,200
sentiment within the industry and how

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,090
ready are these players in their journey

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,920
to micro services you know what's their

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:33,560
place in time into this transition yeah

00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,840
it's a it's often that the hallway track

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,820
is one of the more popular tracks and at

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,419
all of our conferences and it's a you

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,240
know getting to know the audience and

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,430
their unique concerns and really where

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,720
they're at with their work is I think

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,000
useful for the speakers and the

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,790
attendees absolutely you know the risk

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,070
it's being you know relegated in our own

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,279
silos which is always a mistake right so

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,019
being out there speaking with the

00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,000
potential you know developers it could

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,339
be either approach this transition or

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,680
use perhaps even our product it's very

00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,269
helpful for for me and for us to

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,519
understand you know what's the sentiment

00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,110
