	00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,850
so how did we hit those million paying

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,850
subscribers a year ahead of schedule

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,410
what we put it down to is that we

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,170
understand what are the what is the key

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,859
metric that we need to move in order to

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,330
be successful to find it we looked at

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,670
lots of different things we looked at

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,740
revenue we looked at usage we looked at

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,140
cancellation rates we looked at

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,980
conversion rate and what it boiled down

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,640
to unsurprisingly is how engaged people

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,489
are with our content because with the

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,739
remarkable exception of gym membership

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,219
people don't pay for subscriptions that

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,520
they don't use and why is engagement so

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,079
important to the financial times there

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,530
is an enormous competition for attention

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,469
our well-paid successful readers spend

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,219
an awful lot of time in meetings reading

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,579
emails going to conferences playing

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,710
Fortnight on snapchat sometimes and we

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,330
have to justify that when they have the

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,350
time that they choose to spend it with

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,180
us at the Financial Times and we looked

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,920
at lots of things we looked at whether

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,619
they have the app we looked at do they

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,740
share stories how long do they spend

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,689
with our content but what it really

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,159
boils down to where we saw a real

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,310
tipping point was when we looked at

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,650
threes three factors we looked at

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,100
recency how recently did you come to the

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,000
site how frequently do you come in any

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,530
time period and then finally the volume

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,590
of content that you consume when you get

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,290
there all of that is managed into an

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,909
individual engagement score an RF v

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,850
score and recency frequency and volume

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,840
score for every single subscriber to the

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:56,640
Financial Times and at the remarkably

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,649
precise point of 18.2 if we can move

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,259
your engagement score above eighteen

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,350
point two you will move from becoming a

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,689
borderline engaged reader to becoming an

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,539
engaged reader and if you're an engaged

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,009
reader you're worth more to us because

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,290
you're going to stay with us if you're

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,870
coming to us frequently if you're

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,879
reading a lot

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,000
content when you come you are less

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,340
likely to churn and that means as a

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,230
company we know what we need to do we

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,569
need to tip them over that tipping point

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,879
we need to turn them from borderline

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,099
engage to engage subscribers and you can

00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,470
do that by moving any one of those three

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,209
factors if you normally only read us on

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,010
a Monday or Tuesday if we can get you to

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,440
come back on the Sunday you're worth

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,239
more to us if you read more content

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,879
every time you come that's also worth

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,670
more to us and finally if we can get you

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,530
to to come back more often in any

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,340
different given time period we can tip

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,620
you over into that engage segment and

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,230
when I decided to join the FT three

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,180
years ago from Shazam that was a really

00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,349
really key point for me because I run

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,629
product team there on product and

00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,750
engineering teams and if you know what

00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,670
matters to the business then if you hire

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,470
good people and give them the autonomy

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,940
to do the right thing then you can move

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,769
business metrics that matter and the

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,299
company will have more subscribers and

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,640
we will make more money because

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,400
effectively rfv is a churn predictor if

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,819
we can concentrate on engagement then

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,989
churn will largely look after itself and

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,019
I'll talk you through a couple of

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:29,680
examples of how we did that so my ft is

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:31,359
a very simple personalization mechanism

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,859
if you tell us what companies what

00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,180
topics where entities you're interested

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:36,489
in will personalize your experience

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,780
we'll send you emails when there's new

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,700
content on a topic that you're

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,319
interested in and we will personalize

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,790
your experience on site and in the app

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,030
so that you see more content that is

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,650
personally relevant to you and our

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,400
hypothesis was that if we made the

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,690
experience more personalized then people

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,699
would stay with us for longer that they

00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:00,250
would be more engaged and it was true

00:03:54,699 --> 00:04:02,889
our engaged readers were users of my ft

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,109
but we're smart people you're smart

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,970
people we all know that correlation is

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:08,500
not causation we have to prove that

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,150
there is a relation a causal

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,510
relationship between becoming a my ft

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,980
user and and being more engaged so then

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,269
we looked we did some cohort analysis

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,160
and we looked at some groups of people

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,139
some of whom went on to become my FT

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,510
users and some of whom didn't and what

00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:25,090
we found was that the mere act of

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,069
becoming a my FT user increases your

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,919
engagement by 86%

00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:31,650
now that's an enormous number and in

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,270
fact that number is getting higher a

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,009
year ago when we did the same analysis

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,930
we found that the coming of my ft user

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,490
increase your engagement by 30 percent

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,919
and that's because those were early

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,259
adopters but we thought great we know

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,659
that the coming of my ft user increases

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,460
engagement engagement reduces churn ft

00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:50,620
makes more money what we need is more my

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,110
ft users so we went after getting more

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,669
my ft users and consequently we found

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,949
people who are less engaged in the first

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,689
place becoming my ft users and they

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,050
increase in their engagement as a result

00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,050
